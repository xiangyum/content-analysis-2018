      "I was one of the attendees of the event on Saturday.  I am very clear with why I was there from the start. To stand for what I believe in - Democracy and Meritocracy.\n",
      "I have always believe in leadership that's far-sighted. The reason for the reserved election is truly understandable... It is to safeguard the interest of ethnic minorities in the long run. FACT: Surveys have shown that when the three (Chinese, Malay, Indian) races are contested, very highly likely that a non-malay would win the seat. That is also one of the reason why GRCs were formed in the first place. It is necessary that certain racial rights are being protected. We have seen many case-studies overseas about the positive impacts of such action and negative implication of such ignorance.\n",
      "What went wrong? The idea of opening up the presidency to an election. The backward ideas of modern government. The electorate. The complacency. The big wayang.\n",
      "I consider myself as a moderate. As a theatre-maker I surround myself with friends from the extreme spectrum as well as those in between. I respect and hear your views. In terms of theatre-making, that's essential.\n",
      "I am neither anti-PAP nor do I take issue with the individual that's taking the president seat. But when things are wrong, I do my part to point it out, so should you.\n",
      "A healthy functioning democracy must encourage open and robust debates as well as maintain proper checks and balances. This checks and balances must come from the president, chief justice, speaker of parliament, and the news media.\n",
      "From my many talking points, I concluded (as seen in this video) the importance of news media outlets both print and digital to report facts, not opinions. As I joked, \"Leave that to NewNation!\"\n",
      "In a democracy, your Vote is your Voice. When you spoil your vote, you're silencing yourself. When you're denied to vote, you are being silenced.\n",
      "In the last General Election, results show that a majority who voted against the ruling party are the older adults. The majority who voted for the ruling party are the younger votes. The attendance of yesterday's event is a true reflection of that.\n",
      "Moving forward, these are the key areas that I hope to work on in the near future (If you do wish to work collaboratively on them, just hit me up.\n",
      "1. ENGAGING & EMPOWERING THE YOUTHS IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS\n",
      "\n",
      "The sentiment that I have gotten since last week is that youths, in particular, aren't sure how democracy works and their rights as a citizen. Also, Singapore's system of governance. It is important that they participate in this process as democracy can only work when EVERYONE gets involved. Yes, democracy is very messy.\n",
      "2. ENGAGING & EMPOWERING THE MALAY COMMUNITY \n",
      "I am ready to take the hit for this. But I've seen first hand how many people from my community are perpetuating the negative cultural stereotypes of us. We need to cultivate and encourage talents within the community. We need to create an environment that supports our community in bringing out the very best in them. There's an urgency for us to find our identity and voice again. Don't accept something at face value. Don't be easily contented. Think... Think critically.\n",
      "I stand with my Malay community on the need to protect our ethnic rights. Halimah is a good person but as for the way the election process turned out, there are some things that we need to make better.\n",
      "My two cents worth and I do apologise if anyone is offended reading this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the one big value I would fight to keep: Meritocracy. It is the one big reason this kampong girl is now a well-educated, financially-independent woman. No matter what the background, you study hard, work hard, live honestly – and you will be recognised and rewarded. You will get somewhere. Now meritocracy is getting a bad name.\n",
      "Mr Heng Swee Keat put it this way: Extreme meritocracy and competition can lead to a winner-take-all society, with the winners thinking little of others. We need to restore a balance to hard-nosed material pragmatism. As Gandhi put it, we must not have commerce without morality, science without humanity and knowledge without character.\n",
      "Last week, I was at the Inter-JC Current Affairs Quiz hoping against hope that Raffles Institution would NOT win the competition. It did. Sheesh. The only consolation is that the team won by one point. Hwa Chong was second. I was rooting instead for River Valley High, for no other reason than I did not want the usual suspects to sweep the podium. Why can’t we have an “underdog wins’’ story? Why the usual story of an already good school taking the prize? Why oh why couldn’t the competition be fixed?????!\n",
      "Yup. Not very meritocratic of me.\n",
      "But I am not alone in feeling this way. Call it envy but I bet a lot of students and parents want a different story to emerge, a story that will give hope to not-so-smart.  I have seen teams from good schools being shunned by other teams. I have watched as other schools gang up or have an informal pact not to let “that one’’ win. Is this competition? Is this about setting the bar high? Or is it resentment?\n",
      "I have also watched how supposed ‘’scholars’’ group together, speaking a different language about the foreign schools they’ve been too. How others get pissed off at what they perceive as attempts to keep them on the outside. Not enough sensitivity? Or being too sensitive? I have heard the usual talk about how scholars have it easier ; career path laid out. I have the heard the talk from the smart ones too: that they SHOULD be given the breaks.\n",
      "I don’t think anyone would deny that our smartest students have the brains. But it is no longer the case that we admire them because they  do well by dint of their own hard work. We grumble that they are exam-smart, not street-smart. From the sides of our mouth, we mutter about family connections, father is a doctor, mother is a lawyer, got into a good school, money for tuition etc. And because they somehow seem to congregate in some places, whether by choice or design, the word “elite’’ is used to describe the tribe. Bad word, that.\n",
      "That is why no matter how hard the PM pleads with parents not to “over-teach’’ their young ones, they are not going to listen. No matter how much they resent the elite, they want their children to belong in those circles. I believe that this pressure on parents to make sure their kids lead a better life than they do is probably a factor in their calculations on whether to have one or two more. They do not want the Singapore story to end with them. They want their children to continue the story. But how?\n",
      "Because we are such pragmatic people, we do the stuff that would be good for ourselves, sometimes stepping on people along the way. Pragmatism trumps principle. We calculate our worth by the cars we drive, the house we live in, the holidays we take. And smart people talk to smart people, smug in the notion that because they are smart, it is society which owes them and not the other way around.\n",
      "Maybe we should start thinking about teaching humility. Disband the smart ones and put them among the rest. Break the systems that have been designed to supposedly make sure they can push each other to their limits. I don’t doubt that we will still continue to win prizes at the international level. And even if we don’t, it might not be too bad a price to pay if we build smart people with character and with empathy.\n",
      "Yes, I know there is this CIP programme where students go visit the old, the sick etc. And while it’s good experience, it’s too programmed. So, you are young and healthy and these are the old, sick, infirm. We’re boxing people. Might be better simply to have students from different schools mix around with each other. . The bright ones must realise they have peers who lead different lives from them and have different needs.    Meritocracy should remain the avenue for social mobility. But people with “merit’’ should not be blind to their own de-merits and the merits of others who are less favoured.\n",
      "I know the call has always been that the brightest must give back, and how they have an obligation to the society and the system. I am not comfortable with this approach, reducing the need to be nice/kind/charitable to an obligation or duty.\n",
      "At the end of the day, it’s just about being a decent human being.\n",

      "Halimah Yacob's announcement that she will contest the presidency has brought forth several issues that are worthy of debate and clarification.\n",
      "Firstly, the inescapable quagmire of race has once again surfaced. To be fair, this has been the giant elephant in the room that has always been glossed over. As a meritorious society, should the politics of race even be a concern?\n",
      "The ruling party brought in the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) ostensibly to protect minorities and to ensure that the minorities had a voice. What has never been satisfactorily clarified is why some constituencies are GRCs while some remain Single Member Constituencies (SMC). Aren't minorities equally important across all constituencies? The seemingly arbitrary nature of the GRC and SMC construct have led some to question if the GRC was more about party protection and less about minority representation.\n",
      "This begs the question – Unwittingly or otherwise, is the racial equation being used to ensure party power?\n",
      "The changes to the Elected Presidency (EP) brought the politics of race into the forefront again with accusations ranging from reverse racism to tokenism. The EP does not really wield much power in Singapore's political system. How then is carving it out for minorities deemed a means to protect minorities?\n",
      "In my mind, a true meritocracy is based on merit. One's race, gender or socio economic strata should have no bearing on one's abilities or lack thereof. I am not suggesting that unconscious biases do not exist. But surely, the way to overcoming the problem lies in creating equal opportunities for all as opposed to carving out even more categories to divide society?\n",
      "I have no quarrel with Yacob's credentials as an individual. By all accounts, she is an outstanding candidate. Surely that should be what stands her in good stead. Her \"Malayness\" has nothing to do with it. However, because of the government's insistence on the changes to the EP to protect minorities, her stellar qualities are forced to take back seat to her \"Malayness\". This does not do Yacob any justice. Nor does it advance the position of Malays. All it does say (at least to me) is that a position that wields no real power is good enough for minorities. Does this serve to protect minorities? It seems to me is that all it does is to ensure that certain candidates who are deemed \"anti establishment\" do not qualify for this position.\n",
      "Next, you have the by-election conundrum. It appears that there are ongoing discussions as to whether or not a by-election needs to be held. The pieces of legislation in question are Section 49(1) of the Constitution and Section 24(2A) of the Parliamentary Elections Act (PEA). While the former necessitates the calling of a by-election, the latter does not.\n",
      "However, shouldn't the constitution trump the PEA? Besides, isn't it clear that the Constitution was drafted before the concept of GRCs was created?\n",
      "To me, it seems obvious that the Constitution intends for an election to be called every time an MP vacates office. I understand the logistical permutations of GRCs – i.e. do all members of that GRC have to step down? What happens if an opposition member is elected? Can he/she work with the other GRC members?\n",
      "This brings to the forefront the relevance of the concept of GRCs in the first place. Is this the best way to protect minorities? Or does it cause more problems than it purports to solve?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace, not race\n",
      "All this talk about race and race relations, culminating with a president elected on the basis of ethnicity, troubles me.\n",
      "An indelible memory of mine is Mrs Jalleh (Primary one, Tiong Bahru Primary School) teaching me to read about Osman and Kew Teng. They have different types of names, foods and religious practices but hey! they are Singaporeans. Add to that the pledge which we had to recite every day.\n",
      "Like many of my generation (I’m in my mid-fifties), I grew up not thinking of myself as a Chinese. I was simply a Singaporean. My ‘Chineseness’ had never been an issue till I heeded the call to missionary service in Amsterdam (1991), ministering to ex-prostitutes, ex-prisoners, drug addicts, and others on the fringes of Dutch society. There were many economic migrants then, mainly men from East, West, and North Africa, Latin America, other parts of Asia and Europe, and refugees from Yugoslavia which was falling apart.\n",
      "I was accosted by these strange men who would invariably shout some contorted Mandarin phrases at me or make propositions of a sexual nature. At five-foot-nothing, alone in a new country, these unpleasant experiences caused me to reflect on my new membership of a visible minority.\n",
      "Is it because I is Chinese?\n",
      "Imagine my shock when, years later, I found myself at the receiving end of racist behaviour in my own country. Sales people either ignored me or marked me like a potential shop-lifter. We were, however, often greeted with warmth when I entered a shop with the non-Chinese husband.\n",
      "It led me to ask him to enter a shop only after I’ve been in the shop for a minute or so. If we were both warmly greeted, we would stay. If he was the only one who got a welcome, I would tell the staff exactly why we were walking out. ‘Chinese privilege’? Hardly.\n",
      "A multicultural sandwich\n",
      "My parents’ generation carried some stereotypical ideas about the non-Chinese. Yet we got on so well with our neighbours who were Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian. Mum taught us to use polite terms when referring to our neighbours. It took me some time to work out the reference ‘APNN’ in social media. The fact that my father sold pork upset our Muslim neighbours initially, but we all became good neighbours and exchanged festive gifts every year.\n",
      "I miss that Singapore. Very much.\n",
      "It appears that mine is the privileged ‘sandwich’ generation who not only benefitted from incredible social mobility, based on meritocracy, we were also averse to racism. Younger Singaporeans are different. The following analysis on how racism has resurfaced is based on my observations and internet research (for what it’s worth). Make of it what you will.\n",
      "Service and servitude\n",
      "Though ‘service’ and ‘servitude’ have the same root word, they have rather different connotations. ‘Service’ can be an honourable form of serving (eg ‘Civil Service’, ‘National Service’). In contrast, ‘servitude’ implies a loss of personal freedoms (ie slavery).\n",
      "For decades, many Singaporean children have been cared for by foreign domestic carers. Nobody expected this to morph into a ‘race’ issue. I will hypothesize that what these children witness in most of their homes is not service. They see, or at least interpret it as, servitude, with these domestic helpers being at their beck and call.\n",
      "Servitude is encapsulated in the way these human beings are not free to use their bodies as their own. Legislation controls these bodies – with a clear blue line of sex and pregnancy that cannot be crossed – thus rendering them sub-human.\n",
      "Some employers require them to work like (inhuman) robots, even stipulating when and what they can or cannot do on their official off-duty days. Too many believe they ARE robots and inflict unspeakable pain on them.\n",
      "Monkey see monkey do\n",
      "Is there any wonder that our children refuse to consider any service-related jobs (eg catering, sales, plumbing, etc)? It is then a mere hop, skip and jump to transferring this idea of servitude to the thousands of imported workers who perform the lowliest tasks on our building sites and rubbish bin centres.\n",
      "Water-tight legislation ensures that these gastarbeiter (‘guest workers’) will never become citizens. They were in the country, but not of the country.\n",
      "It became acceptable to despise all foreign workers. Call it a ‘boomerang effect’ if you will, because of shared external markers, racist attitudes were transferred to some local-born Singaporeans.\n",
      "Our Indian compatriots, no matter what their personal attributes and achievements, became ‘collateral damage’. They find themselves having difficulties even in hailing a taxi due to such racist attitudes.\n",
      "We did nothing to reduce this dependence on foreign workers. Instead, we invited even more foreign workers into our schools, hospitals, shopping centres, restaurants, and so forth.\n",
      "Us vs Them\n",
      "When foreign workers started filling PMET vacancies, the backlash came.\n",
      "I don’t think I was the only one who felt that Singapore had become a victim of her own success. The ‘us-them’ phenomenon was due to the fruition of a national identity.\n",
      "“We, the citizens of Singapore ….”\n",
      "If we had not gelled as a nation, we would not have cared any less.\n",
      "We should have confronted the big question of integration then: the cooking of curry, noisy Chinese funerals and Malay weddings, sons (and daughters?) serving National Service?\n",
      "We did nothing to assuage the anxieties of local-born Singaporeans. Instead, we were told that lazy Singaporeans should wake up and smell the coffee.\n",
      "Nowhere to hide\n",
      "Actually, no-lah. It was that our spurs are not stuck into our hide. But our skin is not hide. We felt/feel the pain, totally humiliated to be described as working animals.\n",
      "Overnight, Singaporeans became second-class citizens in their own country, the country for which our fathers, brothers and sons have (had) risked their lives during National Service.\n",
      "Meanwhile, those guests we welcomed into our homes, they got the memo: they started to re-arrange our furniture.\n",
      "Speak Mandarin\n",
      "Being Cantonese I could not tell the difference between Hokkien and Teochew, and was teased mercilessly at school. I welcomed the ‘Speak Mandarin’ campaign. Somehow, somewhere, something went awry.\n",
      "Though English is supposed to be the business language, it was Mandarin that got you places. And food. I was not best pleased when a server chided me when I ordered “chendol”. Miss Smug told me that I should have used some Mandarin transliteration (zhen ru?) that no Singaporean would recognize.\n",
      "With respect, I do not call the Terracotta Army ‘clay soldiers’. Chendol will always be chendol to me.\n",
      "The ‘Speak Mandarin’ campaign inadvertently legitimized the primacy of foreign workers who speak it rather better than local Singaporeans, giving them a sense of ‘superiority’.\n",
      "We did nothing to level up the standard of spoken English amongst these. Instead, we let this drift into a situation where Singapore-born non-Mandarin speakers were shut out of jobs because ‘putong hua’ IS the only ‘common language’. \n",
      "My home, my rules\n",
      "When I visit my friends, I don’t re-arrange their furniture. If I feel that my friends might appreciate a pot plant, I would bring one as a gift. But I don’t tell them where they should put it.\n",
      "Just as I won’t re-arrange their furniture, I don’t expect my guests to re-arrange mine. It is different if we were housemates. We will share responsibility in security, checking the burglar alarm is set and the doors are locked, and household bills.\n",
      "Sometimes, after negotiation, we might decide to invest in or move a piece of furniture for mutual benefit and happiness.\n",
      "Chinese vs everyone else\n",
      "I see at least two types of racism in Singapore.\n",
      "The first is the perception and experience of racism by the non-Chinese, perpetrated by the ‘Chinese majority’, hence ‘Chinese privilege’.\n",
      "The second stems from the experience of différence between the different types of Chinese (born in Singapore, Malaysia, China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, etc). Each considers himself/herself a victim of the superior/racist/invasive attitudes of the other Chinese groups.\n",
      "This begs the question: Are all Chinese in Singapore guilty of (1) above if ‘the Chinese’ are not in fact a homogenous group, given (2) above?\n",
      "(Is there a similar kind of division/racism within the Indian and Malay communities that we can only understand if we spoke those languages?)\n",
      "I suspect that the racism I faced in shops is the result of ‘Boomerang effect v2.0’: resentment against anyone who looks (a different type of) Chinese. \n",
      "Whole picture thinking\n",
      "If our power brokers were aware of such problems, it appears that all they did was to order a new carpet, citing the lack of manpower to do the sweeping under!\n",
      "The huge intertwined issues concerning education, manpower, housing, transport, language, old age, healthcare, retirement provision, etc. cannot be resolved by piece-meal tweaking of policies.\n",
      "I have learned, “If you do not set a goal, you will hit it.” Singapore needs ‘whole-country planning’; a re-boot.\n",
      "We need a new vision that all Singaporeans can aim towards; a realistic end-goal that fires our imagination and which we can aspire to attain by a certain time. Such as “a Swiss standard of living”.\n",
      "Many Singaporeans have been to Switzerland. They knew exactly what to aim for. But someone kept moving the goal-posts.\n",
      "Here’s my vision:\n",
      "Every child, a gift to the nation.\n",
      "Every retiree, a source of wisdom.\n",
      "Every worker, a talent to be valued.\n",
      "Or simply: “the end of CMIO classification” because we are “one people, one nation, one Singapore” (credit: Aitchison and Monteiro).\n",
      "Heritage matters\n",
      "We can advance towards this goal by speaking a common language, preferably one that also connects us with the rest of the world. My vote is for English.\n",
      "The Dutch understand that few people will have reasons to learn Dutch. As a result, most of my Dutch (and Slovenian and Finnish) friends are fluent in English as well as one other European language.\n",
      "I get it that speaking Singlish is ‘intimate’. But for education, global business and communication, let us speak a high standard of English as educated Singaporeans of my parents’ generation once did.\n",
      "I teach English as a Second Language as a volunteer. Some of my learners have a far better grasp of grammar than native English speakers.\n",
      "The British government has re-introduced the teaching of grammar in primary schools. So must we.\n",
      "This is not to say that the other languages AND dialects that citizens speak should be side-lined. We must also give place to our heritage languages, be it Mandarin, Hokkien, Tamil, Malay or Kristang.\n",
      "After all, our history, our collective DNA, is written in those languages as well.\n",
      "While we are talking about heritage, let us be bold in preserving the few pockets of heritage spaces we still have left. Get rid of those and we will lose whatever physical history (roots) we and our children can talk about, forever.\n",
      "History cannot be built or grown overnight, especially not with a bulldozer. \n",
      "Grace, not race\n",
      "Ultimately, I wish Singapore to be a country where one’s skin colour is but an accident of birth and which no one cares about because it does not impact on that person’s education and choice of career or life-partner.\n",
      "“Grace, not race” marks our sense of graciousness towards others, no matter what our ethnic, racial, national or even socio-economic origins.\n",
      "Do to others what you wish others to do to you. Love your neighbour as yourself. The result? GRCs will be redundant!\n",
      "Let us set ourselves that political goal. “No more GRCs by 2030”?\n",

      "Singapore’s Bicentennial in 2019 is historic for the country and for all Singaporeans – young and old, native and new citizens, from all sides of the political spectrum.\n",
      "2019 will mark a special year in Singapore’s history, as it was 200 years ago that the modern Singapore was founded by Sir Stamford Raffles and Major William Farquhar of the British East India Company.\n",
      "The history books reveal that on 29 January 1819, a small British party led by Raffles and Farquhar landed in Singapore at the mouth of the Singapore River, and helped establish a colonial port city.\n",
      "Their arrival sparked the establishment of a jewel in the east for the British East Company along with Melaka and Penang, which then turned Singapore from an almost uninhabited island and pirate haunt into a flourishing international port by the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n",
      "200 years on after Singapore’s founding, it looks very likely that Singapore’s Bicentennial in 2019 could well be politically milked for whatever it’s worth.\n",
      "Singapore’s next General Election must be held by January 2021, but it can be called from anytime now, as long as the Prime Minister deems it timely to call for one.\n",
      "As of now though, it looks like 2019 will already be a year filled with feel-good happenings.\n",
      "For example, Changi Airport’s Jewel is due to be ready by early 2019.\n",
      "The Mandai eco-tourism hub, another major tourism jewel, is said to be ready by as early as 2020, but an eco-bridge which local wildlife in the Mandai precinct can travel between two sections of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve will be ready by 2019.\n",
      "The Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL), a joint line between the Thomson Line and the Eastern Region Line will open in stages in 2019.\n",
      "The Greater Southern Waterfront project also looks to be given a boost, as the handover and clearout of Singapore’s port operator PSA from Tanjong Pagar appears to have been completed sooner than expected, with parcels of land set for release for housing.\n",
      "In her book “William Farquhar and Singapore”, Nadia Wright argued that the “ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) further saw Raffles as a worthy man and role model for Singaporeans, and emphasised his self-made career which proved that hard work and determination would bring success, traits which resonated with the PAP’s belief in meritocracy.”\n",
      "To bolster its political capital, the PAP used almost similar tactics to bring about a wave of national patriotism in two previous General Elections – 1984 (25 Years of Nation Building 1959-1984), and again in 2015 (SG50).\n",
      "Don’t use Singapore’s Bicentennial for any other purposes apart from public education and understanding of our heritage and history.\n",
      "In fact, it may be worthwhile for an organising team of Singapore’s Bicentennial celebrations (if there is indeed one) to consist of people from all walks of life, including from across multiple political colours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There appears to be a shift in how the People's Action Party (PAP) is handling public communication involving the influx of foreigners into Singapore. In his National Day 2010 speech released to the mainstream media on 8 Aug 2010, PM Lee Hsien Loong acknowledged \"Singaporeans' concern\" about the government's hitherto open-door policy towards foreigners. He went on to state:\n",
      "\"We will control the inflow, to ensure that it is not too fast, and not too large. We will only bring in people who can contribute to Singapore, and work harder to integrate them into our society. And we will make clear that citizens come first. After all, we are doing this for the sake of Singaporeans.\"\n",
      "While this belated acknowledgment of the opinion and feedback of Singaporeans over the foreign talent (FT) policy is welcome, the Prime Minister has not gone far enough in communicating to Singaporeans the medium to long-term social impact of the policy, and what measures will be taken to address these impending changes. For the Malay community in particular, the changes may be profound. These challenges are illustrated in three overlapping areas that this article will explore.\n",
      "The Total Fertility Rate problem and the Malay Community\n",
      "It is well known that both the Indian and Chinese communities in Singapore are not reproducing at the level required to replace themselves (the population replacement level is statistically set at 2.1, i.e. each couple on average must have at least two children). According to government statistics, the total fertility rate for the Chinese community in Singapore correct as of 2009 stood at 1.08, while the Indian community fared little better at 1.14.\n",
      "According to Department of Statistics data, the TFR for the Malay community stood at 2.54 in 2000, falling rapidly to 2.07 in 2005 (i.e. below the population replacement figure) and continuing its downward slide in 2007 to 1.94, with 2008 recording a TFR of 1.91 and finally with 2009 revealing a TFR of 1.82. According to a government document released in June 2010 titled \"Population in Brief 2010\" collectively produced by five government agencies[1] compared to all the races in Singapore, the TFR for the Malay community \"showed the most significant decline over the past decade\".\n",
      "One of the fundamental prongs of the PAP's FT policy has been to rely on Chinese and Indian immigrants to make up for the abjectly low birth rates of local Chinese and Indian citizens. A separate prong of that very policy calls for additional Chinese and Indian immigrants, so as to increase Singapore's population size.\n",
      "In the first place, opening the floodgates to Chinese and Indian immigrants only when the TFR problem affecting local Chinese and Indians reached a critical point reflects a lack of foresight by the PAP. In fact, the unhappiness among local Indian and Chinese communities over the sudden introduction of large numbers of Indian and Chinese immigrants respectively at the expense of national, social and intra-community unity was raised even in the PAP-dominated parliament well before PM Lee's 2010 National Day commitment to \"control the inflow\".\n",
      "With the Malay community's TFR rate dipping below population replacement levels from 2005 and continuing on a steady downward trajectory, the government would do well to immediately initiate a process of inducting Malay immigrants into Singapore so as to \"top up\" the Malay population to population replacement levels, rather than to wait till the problem reaches critical levels, a mistake the PAP government committed with the Indian and Chinese communities. Such a move to introduce a much more socially manageable number of Malay immigrants will pre-empt and greatly reduce the potential prospect of any social friction that might be felt between resident Singapore Malays and potential Malay immigrants.\n",
      "With a second prong of the PAP FT policy seeking to encourage greater immigration into Singapore to increase the population size of the country, the critical question for the Malay community pertains to the number of Malay immigrants that have been granted citizenship on this account. In the interests of inter-racial and intra-communal harmony in Singapore, the relevance of this question cannot be understated.\n",
      "From the demographic percentages, the numbers for the Malay community have dropped from the traditional 15% mark to around or perhaps even less than 13% today (the latest figures were not stated in the aforementioned \"Population in Brief 2010\" document). This is not surprising, given the steadily falling TFR rate for the Malay community from a high of 2.69 in 1990. Malay community leaders ought to make enquiries into the sweeping effects of the PAP's FT policy before the problem of falling numbers creates feelings of insecurity and irreversibly damages Singapore's social fabric because of the Malay community's demographic hemorrhage.\n",

      "The PAP “Malay-Security-Dilemma”\n",
      "\n",
      "The second tectonic effect of the FT policy on the Malay community finds its roots in a more primordial, pre-independence political worldview - one that has operated below the surface, with little active PAP intervention at invoking a more vocal stance against seeing the world through its eyes – Race.\n",
      "Three separate illustrations will frame this section. First, from independence, relations between Singapore and Malaysia often turned on the lot of the Malay and Chinese minorities in each country respectively. Traditional historians often cast the racial riots of 1964 in Singapore as the straw that broke the camel's back resulting in Singapore, through Goh Keng Swee, requesting to leave the Malaysian Federation.\n",
      "A second bone of contention was Singapore's water dilemma, with Singapore having to rely on pre-independence colonial treaties signed with the southern-most Malaysian state of Johor to secure its fresh water supply.\n",
      "Thirdly, in the 1990s, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew questioned the wisdom of having a Singaporean Malay commander put in charge of a machine-gun unit in Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) - a somewhat catch-all metaphor positing why Malays had to be excluded from certain military appointments, and perhaps a convenient explanation of the abject lack of Malays holding top appointments in the SAF and in the meritocracy-based civil service.\n",
      "Forty-five years after Singapore's independence, it is argued that the relationship between Malaysia and Singapore has taken a fundamental turn with the Badawi and Najib administrations.\n",
      "A HongKong-Shenzhen modelled hinterland relationship has been mooted between Singapore and Johor (Malaysia) through Iskandar Malaysia, in addition to talk of passport-less travel and a possible SMRT line extending to Johor from Singapore. Corporate interests, with some linked to government entities on both sides of the causeway have already committed to a slew of investments in Johor. In addition, from March 2010 this year, the PAP government has allowed Singaporeans to use their Medisave savings for treatment in selected Malaysian hospitals not just in Johor, but in the farther state of Malacca as well, a move that is perhaps the most concrete reflection of a new phase of not just cordiality, but inter-connectedness in Singapore-Malaysia relations.\n",
      "Singapore's reliance on raw water from Johor, often seen by military strategists worldwide as the harbinger of any military hostility between the two nations, is also steadily decreasing. Singapore has already announced it will allow the 2011 Water Agreement with Malaysia to lapse, a move made possible by Singapore's diversification strategy via NeWater, desalination and an increased rainwater catchment area.\n",
      "The perennial PAP Malay-security-dilemma of a Singaporean Malay soldier with family ties in Malaysia who may hesitate to shoot a fellow Malay in Malaysia in times of war, has always sat uneasily with this writer. Although specious, it does not address the prospect of the same dilemma should a Singaporean Chinese with family ties in Malaysia have a Malaysian Chinese in his gunsights, ditto the same quandary for an Indian soldier.\n",
      "Regardless, any talk of conflict between the two neighbours sounds increasingly remote today largely thanks to the efforts of the business community on both sides of the causeway from the beginning of this decade in particular. With significant Singaporean investments in Malaysia, and with the soon to be operational joint development company, M-S Pte Ltd,  incorporated to develop Malaysian railway land in Singapore, both countries have so much economic capital and resources at stake that it makes historical sense to reconsider the traditional bilateral narrative and question the military narrative underlying Singapore-Malaysia relations.\n",
      "Any such exercise ought to have far-reaching, albeit positive implications for the Malay community in Singapore. The image of the loyalty-divided, machine-gun totting Malay Singaporean is increasingly obsolete precisely because of the ever-increasing amounts of economic capital being invested by Singaporeans in Malaysia and Malaysians in Singapore.\n",
      "The aforementioned point notwithstanding, the FT policy has ironically put the issue of the PAP Malay-security-dilemma on the front foot. On the grounds of nation-building and national unity, no reality can be more unfair or emotionally jarring than that of a new immigrant of non-Malay heritage, superseding a Singaporean Malay citizen on grounds of \"security\" in regard to military or civil service appointments.\n",
      "One of the more positive effects of the FT policy in the mind of this writer is that it has forced all Singaporeans to appreciate the nation-building contradiction inherent in the preceding point. In this age of immigration in Singapore, the race-loyalty dialectic makes even less sense, especially since the cornerstone of any immigration policy must be loyalty to the country, not loyalty to race.\n",
      "All said, if the PAP casts the question of the impact of the FT policy on the Malay community as a can that can be kicked further down the road for the next generation to resolve, this writer is convinced that the problem will become exponentially more problematic to address, at the expense of our multi-racial compact.\n",
      "The PAP's Meritocracy and the Malay Community\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the ideological bulwark to the Singapore success story – meritocracy – is supposedly the ultimate barometer of equality in Singapore. While no one doubts the theoretical principles that underlie meritocracy, its impact in the practical realm for the Malay community has been decidedly mixed at best and only benefitting a minority of Malays at worst, notwithstanding former Singapore Minister for Malay-Muslim affairs, Sidek Saniff's resolve in a feature in the Straits Times on 4 Jun 2010 (\"Taking the tough road pays off\") that:\n",
      "\"Meritocracy has hastened the sense of confidence and equal treatment of Singaporean Malays, who feel they are not being stigmatised and can compete on a level playing field.\"\n",
      "While the aspirational objectives of meritocracy for the average Malay (or indeed a Singaporean of any race) in Singapore were put across rather lucidly by the ex-Minister, the educational performance of the Malay community viz. the other communities and the ground reality leaves a chasm that cannot be solely adequately explained or addressed by a PAP commitment to meritocracy.\n",
      "In concert with the 25th anniversary of Mendaki (the Malay self-help community organisation that focuses on education in particular), PM Lee asked for a comprehensive report to trace how far the Malay community had come since the formation of Mendaki in 1982. Taken alone, the report shows good progress made by the Malay community, a feat that speaks well of all the Malay community representatives, regardless of political affiliation, who sought to improve the lot of the Malay community from 1982.  However, as revealed in the report, the progress of the Malay community remained statistically poorer when contrasted against the progress of the Chinese and Indian communities along the same range of indicators, and in some cases, acutely so.\n",
      "Separately, in a question put to the Minister of Education in parliament early this year, Mr Zaqy Mohamed, PAP MP for Hong Kah, asked \"what more can be done to help Malay students progress at the same rate, if not better, compared to their peers from other race groups?\" The Minister's answer was rather standard-form and broad-brushed, without policy specifics.\n",
      "\"Schools will do their part in helping weaker students improve. But MOE also works in partnership with community groups such as Mendaki, parents support groups and other VWOs to provide extra support for these students. Parents and families, of all races, can support students by ensuring that they attend school regularly, motivating them to work hard, and adopting good habits like reading widely. Community and self-help groups can also help families deal with problem issues related to finances, jobs and relationships, in order to create a more supportive home environment.\"\n",
      "In fairness to the government, the community-self help solution has improved the status quo of the Malay community in some ways. But any message of meritocracy and equal competition automatically puts Malays in an inferior position largely because of their relatively lower income and lack of access to opportunity: meritocracy does not mean everybody begins the race at the starting line. Many of our Malay brothers and sisters have other socio-economic battles to fight before they even get in the race, and even when they do, many face an incline right from the get-go.\n",
      "In a thoughtful commentary written by Lendra Putera Nurezki, \"Academic dilemma of the Malay Community Revisited\" for the Singapore-based Centre for Research on Islamic and Malay Affairs (RIMA), the latter observed that \"little progress\" had been made in regard to the academic performance of Malay students over the last 10 years. He suggested that the problem of education and the Muslim community ought to be elevated to the \"national level\" so as to \"spur a consolidated effort...and generate productive solutions\".\n",
      "It is clear that fresh ideas are required to assist the Malay community - ideas that do not diminish their self-respect or which suggest that Malays require a crutch to succeed in Singapore.\n",
      "One possible solution in the education realm posits the creation of a national endeavour that seeks to buttress the goals of meritocracy against rising inequalities in Singapore. This solution portends the creation of an independent government-funded body that operates alongside self-help groups but which transcends race. Depending on its focus, such a body can look at issues in regard to poverty, education etc. from a national perspective, and separately, source its funding (up to10%, or a similar GDP percentage the state spends of education) from the profits accrued from successful divestments made by Temasek Holdings and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. In the case of education for example, it can offer classes or specialized education programs at little-cost only to students who constantly do poorly in schools, complete with specially-teachers trained to assist such students who very often come from poorer backgrounds. And because it would be a non-race based national program, over-representation of Malays or any other race for example would be purely coincidental, particularly since the objective of that very program would be a more egalitarian and inclusive society.\n",
      "In a M.A. thesis submitted to the Department of Malay Studies at the National University of Singapore in 2006, one Hafsah binte Mohammad Kassim, contended that tuition classes alone did not represent the elixir that will solve the problem of the relatively poorer performance of Malay students in school. Significantly, she also raised the issue of \"educationalism\" within the Malay community, and posited that it was time for Malay/Muslim leaders \"to look beyond education in formulating reforms amongst the Malay/Muslim community\". In addition, Hafsah queried the unexplored correlation between improved performance in school and improved occupational prospects for Malays contending that it was \"naïve to believe that all problems and challenges facing the community would inexplicably vanish with the panacea of education.\" Any national effort along the lines prescribed in the preceding paragraph would do well to consider Hafsah's caveat and look to propose holistic, not piece-meal policy solutions.\n",
      "Hafsah's contention represents a good place to end this article that sought to define the principal issues that ought to be at the top of the minds of the Malay community in Singapore today. The long-standing question of Malay loyalty and commitment to Singapore has often found substance in the PAP Malay-security-dilemma as highlighted earlier by this writer. However, in a recent poll done carried out by the Institute of Policy Studies of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, many Singaporeans I spoke to were surprised to note that Malays topped all the ethnic groups (Chinese, Malays, Indians, Others) in their \"Willingness to Sacrifice\" for Singapore.\n",
      "With the impact of FT policy and the increasingly less contentious relationship with Malaysia upon us, Singapore's Malays find themselves at a critical junction – one that ought to be seized upon by the government of the day to better integrate the Malay community within the Singapore social compact. The product of any such policy will compensate for the increasing inequalities prevalent in Singapore society, strengthen the function of meritocracy as national ideology and give real meaning to a more inclusive Singapore.\n",

      "Secretary-General of the Singaporeans First Party (SingFirst), Tan Jee Say, took the People’s Action Party (PAP) to task at its rally on Saturday for undermining its own claim of meritocracy. He also shot down PAP candidate for Tanjong Pagar, Indranee Rajah, who claimed that the PAP puts Singaporeans “front and centre” of everything it does.\n",
      "“I will cite just three examples to show she is wrong,” Mr Tan told the crowd in Queenstown.\n",
      "Mr Tan said in education, for example, primary one school registration does not favour Singapore citizens, but that they in fact share the same priority as PRs.\n",
      "“Also, Singaporean students pay school fees and take up student loans to pay university fees but foreign students get scholarships and free tuition fees to the tune of about $400 million every year,” Mr Tan said, alluding to the government’s revelation after a Parliamentary question was asked of it by an opposition MP.\n",
      "In business, Mr Tan pointed out that the Economist magazine ranked Singapore as Top 5 in the world on its Global Cronyism Index where “politically connected businessmen are most likely to prosper”.\n",
      "“Singapore comes fifth after Hong Kong, Russia, Malaysia and Ukraine,” Mr Tan said. “The word ‘cronyism’ came into popular usage in Indonesia in the immediate post-Suharto era as part of a public revulsion against corruption, cronyism and nepotism.”\n",
      "He said that while in Singapore, we do not have corruption, “a reputable international magazine says there is cronyism.”\n",
      "“We do not have nepotism but we are told that natural aristocracy is good,” Mr Tan added, referring to the phrase used by Mr Lee Hsien Loong recently to describe how Singapore needed to have a certain form of leadership.\n",
      "This was disabused by Mr Tan, who told the rally crowd:\n",
      "Cronyism and aristocracy mean that certain classes of people are favoured over ordinary businessmen and citizens who cannot therefore be in the front and centre of whatever a government does. They are the exact opposite of the principle of meritocracy which allows ordinary people to move ahead on the basis of their capability and not on the basis of political connections or birth. So when PAP leaders next open their mouths with the word “meritocracy”, remind them of these two other words – “cronyism” and “aristocracy”.\n",
      "The Secretary-General, who was a former Principal Private Secretary to former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, turned to the Deputy Prime Minister, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, and his claims of wanting to raise productivity.\n",
      "“In 2010, as chairman of the Economic Strategies Committee, he set a target of 3% growth in real income per year based on an annual productivity growth rate of 3%,” Mr Tan said.\n",
      "However, actual productivity growth has fallen way below Tharman’s target.\n",
      "“In the last four years, productivity grew an average of 0.3%, which is one-tenth of the target,” Mr Tan said. “We are half-way through the decade and it is clear that the 3% target will not be reached.”\n",
      "Mr Tan said Tharman got cold feet and lowered his own productivity target from 3% to 2% for the remaining part of the decade.\n",
      "“This means that even if the target of 2% is attained in the next five years, the overall productivity growth for the entire decade would only be about 1%. It also means that real income growth will only be about 1 % a year at best.”\n",
      "“Does this halfway change reflect well on a government that always tells us that it plans for the long term and is not constrained by short term fluctuations? Is Tharman a man of conviction or a man of convenience?”\n",
      "Mr Tan said while the problem with low productivity is not new, it has been made worse by the PAP Government’s liberal immigration and foreign labour policies “in the past 10 years under the current PM”.\n",
      "“From 2004 to 2014, the average annual GDP growth of 5.8% comprised a huge increase of 5.1% in the labour force while productivity grew only 0.7% a year. PM and Tharman now say we have to increase our productivity through skills training, education and innovation. But they have been singing this same tune for umpteen years without an iota of success to show for their seriousness or competence. Can we trust them to do the job?”\n",

      "If you look just at the National Day Rally – the biggest political speech of the year – and its shorter cousin, the National Day Message, the expression has been uttered six times by PM Lee since 2011 – once each in 2011 and 2012, twice in 2013, then once each again in 2015 and 2017. They were spoken in the context not just of education but housing, healthcare, social mobility and individuals giving back to society.\n",
      "In contrast, from 2004 (when Mr Lee became Prime Minister) to 2010, this set of words did not appear in either annual speech – although, it must be said, some policy announcements were in a similar vein.\n",
      "But there can be little doubt that the phrase is in vogue. And it is probably not an exaggeration to say that since 2011, PM Lee has made the “fair and just society” an integral part of his vision for Singapore.\n",
      "The “fair and just society” slogan has deep roots in PAP history. It was central to the PAP’s early platforms, and was repeated at least up to the 1970s.\n",
      "In 1957, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, then still in opposition, said at a by-election: “We want to establish an independent, united Malaya in which we shall establish within the framework of the democratic non-communist system a fair and just society, a socialist society in which no man can exploit his fellowman.”\n",
      "He won that by-election, and, less than two years later, voters made him Singapore’s first Prime Minister in the 1959 General Election.\n",
      "The 1963 Yang Di-Pertuan Negara speech to open the Legislative Assembly, written by Mr Lee’s Cabinet, included the line: “No single factor is more likely to bring about a more fair and just society than equal opportunities for education for all.”\n",
      "At the 1976 General Election, Mr Lee again said: “In a more fair and just society, (the communists) have not made much headway.”\n",
      "PM Lee Hsien Loong has acknowledged this link to the past. Recording the 2015 National Day Message at Victoria Concert Hall, he said: “It was here that Mr Lee Kuan Yew launched the PAP (in 1954) and inaugurated the long struggle for a fair and just society.”\n",
