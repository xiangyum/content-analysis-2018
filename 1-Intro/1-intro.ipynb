DO NOT tell her with words how you feel or act like a suck-up and buy her gifts and dinners on the first date because you will come off way too eager and wussy. No, you need to be a challenge so that she can see you as being worth fighting for. When you approach a girl and you communicate with her for a little bit, get her email or number (or both) to show her that you like her enough to want to talk with her again. If you are on the date, kissing  or holding hands with her is going to show her that you like her, because people don't generally people they dislike.\n",

Yes, actually sit down one day and WRITE DOWN the most common situations that you run into to meet women and come up with a good opening line (or more, if you like) to start a conversation for each. Rehearse the line many times. Don't only rehearse what you are saying, but HOW you are saying it, that's extremely important. Once you are in the situation and you see a girl that you'd like to approach, if you feel confident and comfortable about your opening line, you will feel more confident about approaching her. Just give her direct eye contact, and deliver your opening line exactly the way you rehearsed it - voice tone, body language, and everything. Remember, practice makes perfect.\n",

      "Women play \"hard to get\" to test your persistance. If you are not persistant, you will fail. If you are too clingy, you will fail. Showing dissapointment to her test will result in failure, because you are letting such a test AFFECT you. Therefore, you treat her as if you normally would treat her when she plays \"hard to get\" and stop her test by making a move. If you call her once a week and she's not returning your calls, DON'T BRING IT UP, AND JUST MAKE A MOVE ALREADY. She's trying to see if you'll easily give up. She's sick of trying to figure out if you like her not and is wanting you to make a move. However, don't call anymore than you normally do just because she's not returning your calls. Keep doing what your doing and acting normal and MAKE A MOVE. When she starts playing hard to get, she's bored with the relationship as it stands and usually wants MORE, so give MAKE A MOVE.\n",

A clingy guy may get jealous or upset that she has not returned his calls. He may get upset or jealous when she shows another guy attention and not him at the time.

A persistant man will just keep trying and not worry or focus on the failures. If he wants to spend time with her, he will do it. AS SOON AS SHE SUGGESTS TO HIM THAT SHE DOES NOT WANT TO BE WITH HIM, HE WILL MOVE ON.
