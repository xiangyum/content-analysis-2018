    "# Week 7 - Information Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we move from arbitrary textual classification to the use of computation and linguistic models to parse precise claims from documents. Rather than focusing on simply the *ideas* in a corpus, here we focus on understanding and extracting its precise *claims*. This process involves a sequential pipeline of classifying and structuring tokens from text, each of which generates potentially useful data for the content analyst. Steps in this process, which we examine in this notebook, include: 1) tagging words by their part of speech (POS) to reveal the linguistic role they play in the sentence (e.g., Verb, Noun, Adjective, etc.); 2) tagging words as named entities (NER) such as places or organizations; 3) structuring or \"parsing\" sentences into nested phrases that are local to, describe or depend on one another; and 4) extracting informational claims from those phrases, like the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triples we extract here. While much of this can be done directly in the python package NLTK that we introduced in week 2, here we use NLTK bindings to the Stanford NLP group's open software, written in Java. Try typing a sentence into the online version [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/corenlp/) to get a sense of its potential. It is superior in performance to NLTK's implementations, but takes time to run, and so for these exercises we will parse and extract information for a very small text corpus. Of course, for final projects that draw on these tools, we encourage you to install the software on your own machines or shared servers at the university (RCC, SSRC) in order to perform these operations on much more text. \n",

    "Open Information Extraction is a module packaged within the Stanford Core NLP package, but it is not yet supported by `nltk`. As a result, we have defining our own `lucem_illud` function that runs the Stanford Core NLP java code right here. For other projects, it is often useful to use Java or other programs (in C, C++) within a python workflow, and this is an example. `stanford.openIE()` takes in a string or list of strings and then produces as output all the subject, verb, object (SVO) triples Stanford Corenlp can find, as a DataFrame. You can do this through links to the Stanford Core NLP project that we provide here, or play with their interface directly (in the penultimate cell of this notebook), which produces data in \"pretty graphics\" like this example parsing of the first sentence in the \"Shooting of Trayvon Martin\" Wikipedia article:\n",

    "Dependency parsing was developed to robustly capture linguistic dependencies from text. The complex tags associated with these parses are detailed [here]('http://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/syntax.html'). When parsing with the dependency parser, we will work directly from the untokenized text. Note that no *processing* takes place before parsing sentences--we do not remove so-called stop words or anything that plays a syntactic role in the sentence, although anaphora resolution and related normalization may be performed before or after parsing to enhance the value of information extraction.

      "[' Young people in Singapore aged 18 to 29 are at a higher risk of having mental problems than older people, a study has found.', 'Here is how they fare in the top three mental woes compared with older adults\\nHigh expectations and hard work are the hallmarks of success, especially in a society forged from the blood, sweat and tears of immigrants.', 'But for one in seven young people, the pressure may be too much to bear and could spell disaster in combination with other factors.', 'That is how many fall prey to mental illness by the age of 30, according to the 2010 $6.9 million Singapore Mental Health Study, whose results were released late last year.', 'Researchers expected those in this group who are in the prime of their lives to be the hardest hit, as other research has borne out how the young are most vulnerable to illnesses such as depression, obsessive compulsive behaviour and alcohol abuse.', 'They found people aged 18 to 29 to be 1.5 times more likely to suffer a mental illness than someone over 30.', 'But what surprised them was that people here start showing symptoms of certain mental conditions at a much younger age than their counterparts in other countries.', 'According to the survey of 6,600 people aged 18 and over, including both Singapore citizens and permanent residents, the median age of the onset of major depressive disorder was 26 and 20 for generalised anxiety disorder.', 'In countries such as the United States, Germany and New Zealand, the median age of onset for both conditions is at least 30 years old.', 'Without further research, one can only speculate why Singaporeans seem to be more vulnerable at an earlier age.', \"But principal investigator Chong Siow Ann notes that late adolescence and young adulthood are crucial periods in a young person's life when he has to make important decisions about almost every aspect of life.\", \"'He has to think about further studies, starting a career, forming romantic attachments and becoming independent of his parents,' said Associate Professor Chong, who is vice-chairman of the medical board (research) at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).\", 'Dr Jasmine Pang, a senior clinical psychologist at Changi General Hospital (CGH), who works closely with young people, said people tend to be vulnerable to mental health problems when they experience such changes in their lives.', 'Eyan, 23, knows well how a stressful change in life can tip the balance.', 'The happy-go-lucky teenager, an only child who never used to give his parents any problems at home or in school, found it hard to deal with the demands of military life when he entered national service at the age of 19.', \"He said: 'I felt stressed when I was scolded for not doing something well.\", 'But nobody seemed to care about how I felt.', \"I felt like my identity was reduced to a four-digit number.'\", 'Eyan, who declined to give his full name, became depressed and started hearing voices that told him to end his life.', 'Cultural differences may well account for the earlier onset of depression and anxiety in Singaporeans, in that the society places a strong emphasis on excellence and meritocracy, and rewards people based on their merits or achievements, said Dr Pang.', \"She said: 'People learn from a young age that they should be hard-working and perform well in their studies and work.\", \"When they do not meet the high demands they place on themselves, they tend to become anxious and stressed.'\", 'The pressure young people here place on themselves is exacerbated by their caring about what other people think, especially their parents, teachers and bosses.', 'This is something which may not matter as much to young people in the West.', \"Said Associate Professor Daniel Fung, chairman of the medical board at IMH and a senior consultant at the hospital's department of child and adolescent psychiatry: 'When they do not meet the expectations of important people in their lives, they become stressed and, over time, may develop symptoms of anxiety and depression.'\", 'Eyan was fortunate in that he was familiar with mental illness.', 'At first, he would not confide in his parents, as they were busy with work.', 'But two of his uncles had schizophrenia.', 'Terrified he would go the same way, he went to his parents, who took him to a doctor at IMH.', 'SUFFERERS SEEK HELP TOO LATE\\nMost sufferers are not as well-informed as Eyan.', 'According to the study, two in three never seek help.', 'Of those who do, it can take years before they go for treatment.', 'For instance, half of those found to have a major depressive disorder waited four years before they sought treatment.', 'Those with bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders?', 'They waited, on average, nine.', 'This has serious implications, both for the individual and the people around him.', 'For the individual, early treatment is crucial, as research shows it helps to prevent relapses, said Prof Fung.', \"'The more relapses a person has, the higher his chance of getting another one, and the less likely he is to recover from his mental illness,' he noted.\", 'Delaying treatment can be especially detrimental for young people, as it could mean they never get a head start in life.', \"Said CGH's Dr Pang: 'The illness can affect their ability to make friends, find a partner or a job.\", \"It can also affect their ability to contribute to society.'\", 'On a wider scale, mental illness imposes the greatest burden on society.', 'more than any other illness which strikes people aged 15 to 44, a study by the Health Ministry in 2004 found.', 'This includes the loss to the economy because people are unable to contribute to it as well as the costs of seeking treatment.', 'The urgency of the problem was underscored by other findings of the study.', \"A young person's risk of alcohol dependence and bipolar disorder is 3.6 and 3.3 times higher than those aged 30 years and above.\", 'Those who seek help will find there are now more resources available to them.', 'Provisions to combat mental illness in the young have been written into the National Mental Health Blueprint, which was introduced in 2007 to promote mental health here.', 'The Government is funding youth programmes by the Institute of Mental Health, such as the Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community Mental Health and Community Health Assessment Team.', \"Eyan was in IMH's Support for Wellness Achievement Programme, where he met a case manager regularly to identify the triggers for his depression and learn how to cope with them.\", 'He also volunteered for a research project by IMH to understand what makes some young people more likely to develop a mental disorder than others.', \"Now 23, and working as a health-care professional, Eyan said: 'I would advise young people who show signs of mental disorder to seek the help of a professional early.\", \"Don't let the stigma of seeking treatment hold you back.\", \"'I was lucky to have sought treatment early because I saw how schizophrenia had affected the lives of my two uncles.\", \"I didn't want the same to happen to me.'\", 'leawee@sph.com.sg\\nMajor depressive disorder\\n1 in 14 young people has it\\n1 in 19 for those aged 30 & above\\nObsessive compulsive disorder\\n1 in 24 young people has it\\n1 in
