"," Young people in Singapore aged 18 to 29 are at a higher risk of having mental problems than older people, a study has found. Here is how they fare in the top three mental woes compared with older adults
High expectations and hard work are the hallmarks of success, especially in a society forged from the blood, sweat and tears of immigrants.
But for one in seven young people, the pressure may be too much to bear and could spell disaster in combination with other factors.
That is how many fall prey to mental illness by the age of 30, according to the 2010 $6.9 million Singapore Mental Health Study, whose results were released late last year.
Researchers expected those in this group who are in the prime of their lives to be the hardest hit, as other research has borne out how the young are most vulnerable to illnesses such as depression, obsessive compulsive behaviour and alcohol abuse.
They found people aged 18 to 29 to be 1.5 times more likely to suffer a mental illness than someone over 30.
But what surprised them was that people here start showing symptoms of certain mental conditions at a much younger age than their counterparts in other countries.
According to the survey of 6,600 people aged 18 and over, including both Singapore citizens and permanent residents, the median age of the onset of major depressive disorder was 26 and 20 for generalised anxiety disorder.
In countries such as the United States, Germany and New Zealand, the median age of onset for both conditions is at least 30 years old.
Without further research, one can only speculate why Singaporeans seem to be more vulnerable at an earlier age.
But principal investigator Chong Siow Ann notes that late adolescence and young adulthood are crucial periods in a young person's life when he has to make important decisions about almost every aspect of life.
'He has to think about further studies, starting a career, forming romantic attachments and becoming independent of his parents,' said Associate Professor Chong, who is vice-chairman of the medical board (research) at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).
Dr Jasmine Pang, a senior clinical psychologist at Changi General Hospital (CGH), who works closely with young people, said people tend to be vulnerable to mental health problems when they experience such changes in their lives.
Eyan, 23, knows well how a stressful change in life can tip the balance.
The happy-go-lucky teenager, an only child who never used to give his parents any problems at home or in school, found it hard to deal with the demands of military life when he entered national service at the age of 19.
He said: 'I felt stressed when I was scolded for not doing something well. But nobody seemed to care about how I felt. I felt like my identity was reduced to a four-digit number.'
Eyan, who declined to give his full name, became depressed and started hearing voices that told him to end his life.
Cultural differences may well account for the earlier onset of depression and anxiety in Singaporeans, in that the society places a strong emphasis on excellence and meritocracy, and rewards people based on their merits or achievements, said Dr Pang.
She said: 'People learn from a young age that they should be hard-working and perform well in their studies and work. When they do not meet the high demands they place on themselves, they tend to become anxious and stressed.'
The pressure young people here place on themselves is exacerbated by their caring about what other people think, especially their parents, teachers and bosses. This is something which may not matter as much to young people in the West.
Said Associate Professor Daniel Fung, chairman of the medical board at IMH and a senior consultant at the hospital's department of child and adolescent psychiatry: 'When they do not meet the expectations of important people in their lives, they become stressed and, over time, may develop symptoms of anxiety and depression.'
Eyan was fortunate in that he was familiar with mental illness. At first, he would not confide in his parents, as they were busy with work.
But two of his uncles had schizophrenia. Terrified he would go the same way, he went to his parents, who took him to a doctor at IMH.
SUFFERERS SEEK HELP TOO LATE
Most sufferers are not as well-informed as Eyan. According to the study, two in three never seek help. Of those who do, it can take years before they go for treatment.
For instance, half of those found to have a major depressive disorder waited four years before they sought treatment. Those with bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders? They waited, on average, nine.
This has serious implications, both for the individual and the people around him.
For the individual, early treatment is crucial, as research shows it helps to prevent relapses, said Prof Fung.
'The more relapses a person has, the higher his chance of getting another one, and the less likely he is to recover from his mental illness,' he noted.
Delaying treatment can be especially detrimental for young people, as it could mean they never get a head start in life.
Said CGH's Dr Pang: 'The illness can affect their ability to make friends, find a partner or a job. It can also affect their ability to contribute to society.'
On a wider scale, mental illness imposes the greatest burden on society. more than any other illness which strikes people aged 15 to 44, a study by the Health Ministry in 2004 found.
This includes the loss to the economy because people are unable to contribute to it as well as the costs of seeking treatment.
The urgency of the problem was underscored by other findings of the study. A young person's risk of alcohol dependence and bipolar disorder is 3.6 and 3.3 times higher than those aged 30 years and above.
Those who seek help will find there are now more resources available to them.
Provisions to combat mental illness in the young have been written into the National Mental Health Blueprint, which was introduced in 2007 to promote mental health here.
The Government is funding youth programmes by the Institute of Mental Health, such as the Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community Mental Health and Community Health Assessment Team.
Eyan was in IMH's Support for Wellness Achievement Programme, where he met a case manager regularly to identify the triggers for his depression and learn how to cope with them.
He also volunteered for a research project by IMH to understand what makes some young people more likely to develop a mental disorder than others.
Now 23, and working as a health-care professional, Eyan said: 'I would advise young people who show signs of mental disorder to seek the help of a professional early. Don't let the stigma of seeking treatment hold you back.
'I was lucky to have sought treatment early because I saw how schizophrenia had affected the lives of my two uncles.
I didn't want the same to happen to me.'

Chong Kee Hiong
When he was in Primary 5, Chong Kee Hiong scored the highest marks for mathematics and Chinese.
But his teacher at the now defunct Kim Keat Primary School told him he had won one prize too many and gave the maths award to another pupil who had finished half a mark behind.
'I didn't argue with the teacher but I was very upset,' recalls the chief executive of serviced residences operator The Ascott. 'The fact that I still remember it with such clarity shows that I am still disturbed by it.'
The episode goes against the ideals of fair play and meritocracy which he holds dear. After all, he says, Singapore's meritocratic system made it possible for the son of a poor shoe seller to make good and become head honcho of the world's largest owner-operator of serviced apartments.
He was the youngest of 11 children, and the family got by on the meagre earnings of his late father, who ran a small footwear stall in the Bendemeer market.
Home was a Housing Board rental flat in Toa Payoh.
'There were just two bedrooms. All the boys slept in one room; all the girls and my paternal grandma slept in the other. My parents slept in the living room,' he recalls.
He ended up in the living room too, and the sofa was his bed for several years until his teens.
Life was not easy and money was often tight. The children had to help out at their father's stall on weekends, and their mother sometimes had to borrow from her parents to help tide over tough times.
'Being the youngest, I probably had it better than my siblings. But to save money, I packed food from home to school,' he recalls.
Mr Chong, 46, reckons he was aware of his poverty from a young age and probably nursed a subconscious desire to improve his lot in life from the time he was in primary school.
He remembers that when he was in Primary 1, he was called up, along with a couple of other small, skinny pupils, to stand in front of the class.
'The teacher asked us what milk we drank. I don't think she was out to embarrass us, she just wanted to know why we were small,' he recalls.
'But it wasn't a nice feeling to be singled out, and made to feel deprived.'
Fortunately, he is stoic. It's a quality he thinks he developed from voraciously devouring Chinese sword-fighting novels by some of the genre's most loved writers, such as Jin Yong, Gu Long and Liang Yusheng, as a child.
'In these novels, the heroes will always prevail although they have to undergo a lot of hardships first,' he says with hearty laugh.
'Also, in many of the stories, skilful pugilists and old masters would impart their skills only if the heroes showed great perseverance and sincerity, so I told myself I needed to have those qualities too.'
He is a self-starter in more ways than one.
Blessed with the smarts, he never gave his parents any angst over his schoolwork. In fact, his education was practically self-financed.
'I collected a bit of money from clan associations in the form of bursaries in primary school. I would pass all of it to my mother,' he recalls.
Mr Chong, who attended Raffles Institution and Raffles Junior College, received three scholarship offers when he got into the National University of Singapore.
Although he initially wanted to study engineering, he settled on accountancy and accepted a scholarship - which paid $5,000 a year - from auditing giant KPMG.
'It was the mid-1980s and there was a recession. An engineering course would have taken four years instead of three and engineering graduates were also finding it difficult to get a job then,' recalls Mr Chong.
'I needed to earn money fast; I wanted to be more financially independent for myself and family.'
He gave tuition to help finance his university studies, and is the only graduate in his family.
Right after graduating in 1990, he started work as a graduate assistant with KPMG. Besides providing a good grounding in business processes and management, the job also honed his emotional intelligence as he audited the likes of clients like Citibank.
'No client likes auditors and you have to have certain skill sets to let them know you're not out to 'sabo' them,' he says, using the colloquial term for sabotage.
He stayed for four years, during which he was promoted to senior supervisor, before joining one of Singapore's best-known architectural firms RSP as finance manager. He went on to become its financial controller.
He stayed at RSP for two years. By then, married to Monica, a colleague from KPMG, he told himself that his resume would look more impressive if he had overseas exposure.
The opportunity came when he joined Tuan Sing Holdings, which has businesses in, among others, property development and hotels.
He was sent to Shanghai in 1997 to oversee finance and administration, and was among the first wave of Singaporean expatriates based in the Chinese city.
'The expatriate life was quite good in those days... For instance, you paid a bit more but you could get doctors to come and see you, not the other way round,' he says with a laugh.
But there were also challenges, such as business practices being not quite endorsed in Singapore. Corporate governance, for example, was given short shrift by many companies.
Tuan Sing, he says, was one of the few companies which paid full taxes then.
'A lot of people asked, 'Why do that?' and told us how we could get around it. We said no, and we made sure we stuck to it.
'I said it might work to our disadvantage in the short run but, in the long run, our reputation would be good.
'People came to respect us for that. We are a listed company, we didn't want it to be a problem. Respect is important because when people lose respect for you, they can do a lot to undermine you.'
He says China changed as it went from strength to strength as an economic powerhouse.
'Things are much better now. The country's more open and it treats everyone much fairer now,' he says.
After his Shanghai sojourn, he had a brief stint as a senior vice-president in an IT company before entering the hospitality industry in 2001.
He joined Raffles Holdings as chief financial officer when it was in the midst of acquiring Swissotel for 410 million Swiss francs.
He moved over to The Ascott - a subsidiary of real estate giant CapitaLand - as deputy chief executive officer three years later.
He played a key role in the successful listing of subsidiary Ascott Reit, the world's first Pan-Asian serviced residence real estate investment trust, in 2006.
The unit invests primarily in real estate and real estate-related assets which are income-producing and used mainly as serviced residences or rental housing properties.
'The Reit market was fairly new then; even the serviced-residence asset class was relatively unknown,' he says.
Mr Chong charted Ascott Reit's business, investment and operational strategies until he became Ascott's head honcho this year. Its asset size has tripled since its listing to $2.81 billion with 65 properties in 24 cities.
Ms Lee Sze Yeng, a KPMG partner, has known Mr Chong since 1991 when he was her senior at the accounting firm.
'I've seen him moving into different jobs and doing well in each. It's to do with his character. He enjoys challenges and is not contented with doing the same thing.'
She adds: 'People see accountants as square but he has very sharp business sense and a very commercial perspective on things.'
Meritocracy, says Mr Chong, is his key guiding principle as a corporate leader.
'I believe we should be objective and fair by rewarding people based on the results they achieve. When people see that they are rewarded based on a fair system, they will be naturally motivated to do their best.'
Life has turned out well for the affable man.
He and his family live in a semi-detached house in Bishan, he drives a Mercedes convertible and has made some prudent investments.
He throws out a Chinese adage when asked if he has had any disappointments in life: 'Zi yu yang er qin bu zai'. It expresses a son's regret at not being able to look after his parents in their old age.
'I'm now in a position to look after my father but he is no longer around,' he says. His father died in 1985 while he was in national service.
But he says he will do his best for his mother, who is 85 years old and lives with him.
Success, however, has not made him forget his roots.
Last November, he took his wife, two of their four sons and one of his brothers to visit his father's village in Meixian, in Guangdong province.
His father was the second of five children, the only son, and never returned to his ancestral village after coming to Singapore as a young man in the 1940s, although his widowed mother joined him here later.
For Mr Chong, the trip to his father's village proved to be an emotional experience.
'There I saw the house that he shared with five other families. I was told that he walked six hours from his village to the pier to take the ship to Singapore and that was the last they saw of him,' he says.
He met everyone in the village, hosted a lunch for 80 people, and visited his grandfather's grave.
He also met his only surviving aunt, the youngest of his father's four sisters, who is now in her 80s.
'The moment I saw her, I knew she was my aunt. She looked like my father and her mannerisms were like my grandma's. She would hold my hands while talking to me.
'It was amazing, and not at all awkward,' he says.
He intends to revisit soon and to take with him his other children and siblings.
Having experienced a childhood where many things were beyond his means, he says he is tempted to give his four sons - aged between six and 14 - more than what they need.
But he and his wife decided it is more important to instil in them the right values, the drive to do well and to work for what they want.
Not too long ago, his wife told him that their second son had been going to the school bookshop, looking longingly at some of the items which he could not afford with his pocket money.
'We give him just enough pocket money for food during recess,' he says. 'So when I heard it, I felt a pinch of sadness.
'But I had to remind myself that there is a bigger lesson that my boy will have to learn and understand eventually.'
And that is, if you work hard, have the desire to do well and grab opportunities given to you, you will do well.
That, he says, is the beauty of meritocracy.

"," AS EVENTS of the past week have revealed, the divisions between Singaporeans and foreigners, between so-called 'old' Singaporeans and 'new' Singaporeans, are deep and worrisome.
We must take the task of integrating foreigners, 'new' Singaporeans, as seriously as we took racial integration or religious harmony. Indeed, the local-foreign divide may pose a more serious risk to our social stability now than racial differences. The differences within each race today - especially among Chinese and Indians - seem to be greater than the differences between the races. That is so chiefly because of the large inflow of ethnic Chinese from the mainland and ethnic Indians from the subcontinent into Singapore over the past decade or so. We have to deal with this problem - now, urgently - or we will have a fractured society, a divided polity.
Consider what has happened in Sweden and Denmark, two countries that many people in Singapore - progressives, liberals, centrists - admire: The anti-immigrant, far-right Danish People's Party is now Denmark's third largest party; and in Sweden, the equally anti-immigrant, extreme right Sweden Democrats won for the first time 20 out of 349 seats in the country's parliamentary election in September 2010.
The Danes - the only people in occupied Europe who resisted en masse the Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II - and the Swedes - synonymous almost with decency and tolerance - if the politics of such peoples can be altered in such ghastly directions because of anti-immigrant feelings, it behoves us in Singapore to pause, ponder and examine carefully our own situation.
The situation is not all black. But it isn't all white either. It is in shades of grey where new citizens - the main subject of this conference - are concerned; greyer with permanent residents; greyest, dark grey in fact, where Employment Pass and S-Pass holders, the dreaded foreign talent or 'FT' of the blogosphere, are concerned.
There is no doubt that Singapore took in immigrants at such a rate in the second half of the last decade so as to overwhelm our absorptive capacities - psychologically, socially, economically, and I fear, politically as well.
But the fact of the matter is Singapore cannot avoid continuing to bring in foreigners. Even if we allowed the number of non-residents in Singapore to go down from the current one in four people to one in five, we would continue to add foreigners. Even if we took the near-impossible step of just freezing our current workforce number - have a steady- state workforce, as it were - we would still have to bring in foreigners.
This is because our birth rate is so low that if we were to halt all immigration now, as many people would be leaving the workforce as entering it within eight years in 2020. Soon after that, many more would be leaving the workforce than entering it, and Singapore's economy will totter into premature senescence.
How do we make immigration socially and politically acceptable? We have to have an open- door immigration policy. But how do we make that policy sustainable?
This is a complicated subject, but I'll make two suggestions.
One, not only must we have a big open gate to allow in immigrants - the right kind of immigrants, like Mr Sirajul Islam, who rescued his neighbours in a burning Housing Board flat - not only must we have a big open gate to welcome such immigrants, we must also have a high fence to keep out the people we don't want, and we must have speed bumps before that open gate to slow down, to pace out, the entry of new immigrants.
We already do have a high fence. Illegal immigration is hardly a problem in Singapore, unlike in the United States and in parts of Europe. And we have speed bumps now too, for the Government has tightened the inflow of foreign workers since last year. We have full employment, so it isn't as though Singaporeans are being displaced by foreigners.
But there is enough anecdotal evidence of employers replacing Singaporeans, especially among the PMET (professional, manager, executive and technician) class, with cheaper foreigners, to give one pause.
We should consider what many other countries, including Australia and the US, have: require employers to show they cannot get a Singaporean or PR to fill particular positions before they are allowed to bring in a foreign national. If we don't have highly visible speed bumps, in addition to that high fence, an open-door immigration policy will become politically unsustainable.
But once we let in people through that gate, we must welcome them, make them one with the Singapore family, integrate them. That is the second point I wish to make: We cannot have a house divided between old Singaporeans and new Singaporeans, first-class Singaporeans and second-class Singaporeans.
And integration cannot be a one-way street, with Singaporeans smiling and welcoming foreigners. It has to be a two-way street. Integration does not mean assimilation - but it does mean accepting a certain set of core beliefs and habits that we have come to see as quintessentially Singaporean: among them, multiracialism, religious tolerance, meritocracy, democracy and good order.
When in Singapore, act like a Singaporean - and that goes for Singaporeans too, for discrimination of the foreigner, intolerance of the other, prejudice, aren't core Singaporean principles.
If I may rewrite S. Rajaratnam slightly, we must all learn to say or think: We, the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves as one united people, regardless of race, language, religion, or country of origin.
The writer is director at the Institute of Policy Studies and a Straits Times associate editor. This is an extract from his speech yesterday at the opening of the institute's Conference on Integration.
Not only must we have a big open gate to welcome such immigrants, we must also have a high fence to keep out the people we don't want, and we must have speed bumps before that open gate to slow down, to pace out, the entry of new immigrants.

"," MERITOCRACY is a valued ideal in most of the modern world. But it is not natural, it can never be absolute and it needs constant attention. That is true everywhere and I believe that Singaporeans are realistic about Singapore being a meritocratic city-state with institutions in place to sustain it.
I was reminded of the ideal when visiting universities in China recently. There are dedicated scholars and brilliant students in many of the universities but fierce debates are going on about meritocracy as an institution. There is the touching belief that if there were meritocracy, many problems in the country would be solved.
But, in the universities, questions are raised as to how they could be rid of failings like fraud, favouritism, corruption, official interference and plagiarism that plague most corners of the system.
One point regularly made was that the Chinese should be reminded that Confucius was the first to propose that education be the basis for meritocracy in public service.
Indeed, most Chinese know that Confucius formulated the ideal that no one who wanted an education should be denied it. But Confucius was neither dogmatic nor optimistic about the possibility of meritocracy. He also believed that the most natural bonds in society were familial, especially those between parents and children. It was natural for families to favour their own. And many Confucian thinkers considered being filial as the first step to being a loyal subject.
This may seem contradictory. Confucius sought to avoid that by introducing the idea of reciprocal feelings: It was natural that when parents were caring as parents, children would respond with filial love. Similarly, rulers who provided their subjects with good governance would deserve their loyalty. It was in that context that education was the key.
It was therefore necessary to educate children, parents, subjects and rulers to moderate what was natural in society. Only in that way would people be prepared to challenge the idea that only those born to rule should be allowed to exercise power over others.
Therefore, princes, aristocrats and powerful warriors could be told that they could not be good rulers unless they were educated to that task. They could conquer their kingdoms on horseback but not rule from the saddle. They would need guidance from those carefully trained and selected to manage the state according to proper principles.
This led to the belief that the best way to achieve good governance was to choose the most talented people through different kinds of examinations. The system evolved over the centuries, and continuous efforts were made to ensure the fairness that earned the system respect.
With this mechanism, the combination of state power and bureaucratic management was committed to support a form of meritocracy. China's success attracted modern imitations and various forms of examination have now become the global norm.
Yet the system remained flawed throughout Chinese history. The obvious enemy of meritocracy might seem to be the temptations of office, but it was merito-cracy's cousin, elitism, that was more threatening in the longer run. Elitism came easily when mandarin graduates sought to help family members also to succeed. It needed strong commitments to the meritocracy ideal to prevent the rise of a natural oligarchy and even a virtual aristocracy.
This ideal, respected in Singapore and elsewhere, has its roots in the standards required for public service in imperial China. When conditions were favourable and the rewards for examination success were assured, elitist ambitions would grow in most official families. It was natural for those who succeeded and served loyally to hope that rewards will follow for generations. However, for the vast majority, their chances for similar success were slim. They might have to wait for rebellions or foreign invasion to provide new opportunities for these elites to be replaced.
China's long history has demonstrated that meritocracy was never absolute. No doubt it was bolstered by strong family values but it was also continually threatened by the natural instinct for powerful clans to build privileged bases for their clansmen.
Modern states and societies also want to minimise the elitism that could endanger the meritocracy ideal. Of course, no one can guarantee there will always be a level playing field. Birth and talent are never equal, and all societies expect a degree of unfairness. But, like the Confucians before them, they recognise the constant need to nurture the desire for a just society to enable upward social mobility.
The institutions designed to support equal educational opportunity are not always secure but, as long as they are monitored and regularly reviewed, most people will believe that the spirit of meritocracy can survive.
It is in that context that I found it encouraging that so many young Chinese are finding time to pursue some of the ideas of the once officially shunned Confucians. A surprising number of students I met have read the original classical texts to try and fathom what these might mean for Chinese society today. They do not approach it with the faith that their ancestors once had, but are doing so with a readiness to contemplate how ancient ideals might be reinterpreted to help find answers to current questions.
I am not sure they will be satisfied with what they find. It is difficult to relate ideals that flourished in an agrarian society to the demands of people who have moved to post-industrial towns and cities. The lives of the young in China are increasingly like those of their counterparts in Singapore. They are engaged daily in dealing with global developments that could not be more different from what their fathers experienced.
But the Chinese people are remarkably resourceful and pragmatic. Although they will discover that Confucian idealism is not enough, they may find that a strong dose of it can help rebuild the institutions vital for the spirit of meritocracy to survive.

"," COMMUNITY groups like Jamiyah play a key role in Singapore, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last night at a dinner to mark the Malay-Muslim missionary organisation's 80th anniversary.
They complement the Government's approach, which is to help all ethnic groups across the board through the provision of goodquality housing, health care and education, and ensure a system based on meritocracy.
This approach has worked well for Singapore, Mr Lee said, as all communities have progressed in tandem, including the Malay-Muslim community.
'People have made achievements based on merit and fair competition, so that every Singaporean can take pride in their accomplishments and progress,' Mr Lee said.
'And it has strengthened the Singapore identity, as we have improved our lives together.'
Community-based groups such as Jamiyah are there to meet the unique needs of each community, especially in the social and cultural fields, he added. Jamiyah, founded in 1932, has used education programmes as its foundation, with the Jamiyah Kindergarten and Jamiyah Business School, to assist in social mobility.
It has also partnered other Malay-Muslim organisations like Mendaki and the Association of Muslim Professionals to serve a wider community more comprehensively, Mr Lee said.
But it also opens its programmes to non-Malays, and it has had many joint initiatives with other organisations such as the Catholic Archdiocese, the Hindu Endowments Board, the Central Sikh Gurdwara and the Taoist Federation of Singapore.
Mr Lee also highlighted Jamiyah's long cooperation with the Buddhist Lodge, thanks to the friendship between Jamiyah's former president Abu Bakar Maidin and Buddhist Lodge president Lee Bock Guan. Mr Lee praised this approach, saying that it reflected an emphasis on inter-religious harmony.
He also spoke of Haji Abu Bakar's contributions, noting that he helped build Jamiyah from a group with 190 members and just $5.60 in the bank in 1970 to more than 35,000 members today.
As the profile and demographics of the Malay-Muslim community change, Jamiyah needs to stay relevant and review its programmes. Today, there are many more Malay-Muslim professionals and businessmen whose skills and resources can be tapped to craft programmes for the community, and to guide younger leaders, Mr Lee said.
One such programme is the Jamiyah Business School which helps out-of-school young people to continue their education, said Dr Anwar Ali, an exam controller at the school.
He said: 'The kids who have dropped out may never have the opportunity to go back to the mainstream or continue their education. But once they come here, the gap is breached between the dropouts and the mainstream and most of them can go to a better level.'

"," Questions about policies seen as discriminating against Malay-Muslims surfaced at a frank dialogue between professionals from the community and the Prime Minister yesterday.
Mr Muhamad Ali Aman from the Motivasi Youth Association asked PM Lee Hsien Loong if he would consider doing away with the ethnic quota for public housing.
He knew of a Malay family who got a queue number to select a Build-to-Order flat but was later asked to re-apply because the quota for Malay households was filled.
Responding, Mr Lee said: 'Sometimes the Malays hit the limit and then they have to apply again. I don't think that is being unfair to Malays. I think that can happen to any community.'
Chinese and Indian Singaporeans have gone to him for help when they could not get a unit as the empty flats in the block were reserved for other races, Mr Lee added.
He stressed that it is 'necessary for us, even today' to have rules ensuring a mix of ethnicities in public housing. Otherwise, in five to 10 years, ethnic enclaves might form in different parts of the island and lead to 'a very different Singapore'.
Another participant asked Mr Lee when policies governing ethnic participation in the military would be removed.
Mr Lee reiterated that the Singapore Armed Forces work on the basis of merit. Each soldier is assessed on his abilities and contributions and posted to 'where he is best able to make that contribution'.
The situation concerning Malays in the SAF is one 'that is moving', he said, adding that Malay officers and specialists have been doing better and getting promoted year by year.
Another participant said some Malay-Muslims have told him they emigrated because they felt discriminated against in Singapore.
PM Lee said he would be hesitant to attribute their departure to discrimination as people from all races leave the country for various reasons.
While Singapore remains a multiracial society, Mr Lee stressed: 'To the best of our ability, we deal with one another on the basis of your contribution - what can you do, how good are you.
'Is it perfect? Maybe not 100 per cent. But I would say we get an A grading compared to any other society in terms of meritocracy.'

"," ONE problem with foreign misfits - immigrants who love Singapore's wealth but not its people - is perception. They believe that Singapore is an extension of their lands.
I know because I used to be one of them myself.
When I came to Singapore in 1984, I brought along the baggage of history. Modern Singapore had been established by Stamford Raffles of the East India Company in 1819 and ruled as a dependency from Calcutta till 1867. Since I, too, had arrived from Calcutta, I came with a vicarious sense of entitlement.
I was incensed therefore by signs of cultural attrition. Roti prata was an unbearable tautology because prata is a kind of roti. When I heard what sounded like roti jaan, I thought that I had stumbled on a recipe by Umrao Jaan, the famous Lucknow courtesan. The briyani in many hawker centres was both a semantic and a culinary misnomer. It was nothing like the real briyani found in South Asia, where the meat is cooked in the rice and not added as a South-east Asian afterthought.
In my case, I realised quickly enough that these were Singaporean realities. They made the place different, authentic and exciting. It was futile to look for India in Singapore, as it was to look for Singapore in India. Singapore is itself because it is not India, and vice versa.
That is true of every other country as well. Singapore is not a distant cousin of China or the younger brother of Malaysia. Britain, China, India and Malaya are all a part of Singapore's history. But they are not Singapore's history.
Similarly, most Singaporeans are the descendants of immigrants: They are not immigrants themselves, floating forever up and down some imagined diasporic sea. Singapore's culture is not an imported commodity; Singapore's identity is not a derived one. It is what real people living on this actual piece of land have constructed, merged, changed and preserved over seven durable centuries.
The problem with foreign misfits, I suspect, is often that they look for the countries they have left behind. And if those countries have played defining roles in Singapore's history and culture, they believe that they have a right to judge Singapore in the light of their own national histories and cultures.
They are looking for the wrong things in the wrong place.
Of course, to go to the other extreme and deny the international provenance of modern Singapore would be equally wrong. It was mostly the labouring masses of the foreign-born who literally built Singapore and turned it into a global city of the time.
But the crucial point is not that they came but that they stayed. They were the proto-Singaporeans to whom we owe our historical depth and our cultural breadth as a people.
The moment I realised that, I repatriated the expatriate in me. On a day that was like a rebirth, I became a citizen. I became one of us.
Immigration angst
MY HUMBLE story bears a little on the angst over immigration today.
While competition for jobs, education, transport and living space is a genuine issue, it can be addressed by fine-tuning policies. What no policy can do is determine the culture of a people and hence the degree to which immigrants can be integrated. That culture comes from a people's sense of its place in time and from the habits of the heart produced by the everyday sharing of a common space.
When Singaporeans respect their authenticity and integrity as a people - a people with their own history and culture - they are less likely to feel that they will be absorbed into the lifespans of ancestral countries such as China or India.
Even a city-state will keep its place between the orbital pulls of continent-size and civilisation-long countries. Immigrants from them will not pose a cultural threat within Singapore.
By contrast, defensiveness is the opposite of confidence, just as arrogance is the alter ego of insecurity. As more foreigners look to make Singapore home, strident anti-foreign sentiments create a very poor impression of Singapore. Indeed, they make Singapore look parochial when in reality it is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world.
At the end of the day, it is the self-confidence of Singaporeans that will preserve them and protect the common space into which newer Singaporeans can fit.
After all, it is cultural self-confidence - ranging in attributes from accent and historical awareness to non-negotiable social norms - that makes America and Australia two of the most powerfully integrative societies of our time. It is not their size.
That should be the yardstick for integration in Singapore as well. One does not necessarily have to pass the durian and Singlish tests: I personally would have gone on hunger strike and adopted a vow of silence if forced to do so. But durian and Singlish are a part of Singapore culture and must be accepted.
There are more substantial norms that have to be respected. Singapore is a multiracial, multi-religious meritocracy and a secular Republic. It is not perfect but its people generally judge themselves by these standards.
Those to whom these standards appear alien will always remain alien in Singapore. Those who find these norms appealing will find a home in Singapore.

"," AS MANY as eight out of 10 Singaporeans believe the standard of living in Singapore will keep rising, according to a Straits Times survey. Most also see their children's chances of succeeding in life as better than theirs.
But at the same time, eight out of 10 worry the income gap will slow social mobility while six out of 10 think the Government is not doing enough to help people move up the socio-economic ladder.
This picture of cautious optimism emerged from a survey commissioned by The Straits Times, on whether people still believe in the Singapore dream of advancement through meritocracy amid public concerns about a growing income gap.
The findings of the phone survey done in May, of 400 citizens aged 21 and older, took observers by surprise yesterday.
National University of Singapore (NUS) sociologist Tan Ern Ser said the high levels of confidence were 'quite remarkable' given unhappiness in the last few years over the influx of immigrants and the rising cost of living.
But amid the confidence was an awareness that with rising standards comes rising competition.
While 80 per cent say that their children's standard of living will be higher than theirs, this drops to 60 per cent when asked if their children's opportunities for success will be better than theirs.
This is because success is defined at a higher and higher bar in a fast-paced society, explained NUS sociologist Irene Ng.
Asked about their own economic prospects, people were more sombre: About four in 10 said their economic circumstances 10 years from now would be better or much better. The same proportion said it would be worse and much worse.
This, said Professor Tan, shows current economic worries and fluctuations have not eroded belief in Singapore as a 'viable entity' to raise their children.
Most surprising to the experts, however, was the reaction to the income gap, and the strong consensus that a big income gap will slow social mobility.
NUS' Dr Ng noted that in countries like Britain, only a minority are in favour of income redistribution to help the poor while in Singapore, most think the Government is not doing enough.
Said Mr Yeoh Lam Keong, vice-president of the Economic Society: 'People are correctly perceiving the impact of a wide income gap. And they are sending a clear message that they are uncomfortable with it.'

"," ENTREPRENEUR Kenneth Li, 26, never doubted he would make it to university if he worked hard. That was so even when his divorced mother's $1,200 monthly salary as a hawker could barely support him and his three siblings.
In Henderson Secondary School, he was demoted to take N levels after struggling in the Express stream. He was then 15 years old. He felt indignant that students from top secondary schools had an 'easier path' with the resources and teachers they were given.
Mr Li, a Nanyang Technological University business school graduate, now runs a corporate gift company that makes $350,000 in revenue a year.
The reason he never doubted that he would be successful, he says, is that he was Singaporean. 'Here, everyone is equal. If I worked hard, I knew I would have a chance.'
In fact, his humble beginnings have given him an edge, he says. 'I coped with my studies and worked at the same time. I was more adaptive and independent, and that gave me the feeling that I am different. I can achieve what others cannot.'
Stories of relentless upward advancement like Mr Li's are perhaps why, despite the stresses and strains of a maturing society, Singaporeans still believe that the country as a whole is on the rise.
In May, Insight asked 400 Singaporeans a range of questions designed to find out if they believe that the Singapore Dream is still alive and well.
Asked if their children's standard of living will be higher than theirs, 79 per cent said yes.
Asked if their children's opportunities to succeed will be better than theirs, 58 per cent said yes.
But amid the optimism, a gnawing worry has emerged - that the playing field is becoming too uneven. Seven in 10 respondents were worried about the income gap between rich and poor, and eight in 10 thought the gap would affect social mobility.
On the up and up
IN APRIL, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam made reference to a poll of 2,000 Americans that was conducted by the US non-profit Pew Charitable Trusts last year.
Only 47 per cent of Americans thought their children would have a higher standard of living than they did, a sharp fall from the 62 per cent that said so in 2009, when the survey was done for the first time.
The sharp drop was due to the 2009 financial crisis, which had caused US unemployment to spike to its highest level in 26 years.
Speaking at a Mendaki forum, Mr Tharman was unequivocal that Singapore 'must never' allow a similar situation.
It was the latest comment in a national conversation about growing stratification in Singapore, first sparked by data released by former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew early last year.
These showed that in top schools like Raffles Institution and Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), the percentage of students whose fathers are university graduates does not fall below 50 per cent.
In contrast, in neighbourhood schools like Jurong West Secondary and Bukit Merah Secondary, the number hovered around 10 per cent.
In March last year, then Education Minister Ng Eng Hen sought to reassure MPs in Parliament that mobility was alive and well in the education system. He disclosed that half the children from families in the bottom third socio-economic bracket actually score in the top two-thirds of their PSLE cohort.
Insight decided to ask Singaporeans for their perceptions of economic mobility. It commissioned a survey of 400 citizens aged 21 years old and above. They were asked similar questions to those posed in the US Pew study, such as if their children's standards of living would be higher than theirs.
By many markers, Singaporeans felt better-off.
The 79 per cent that said their children would have a higher standard of living was indeed, as Mr Tharman hoped, much higher than the corresponding number of Americans who felt so.
And when asked if they earn enough to live comfortably, 70 per cent of Singaporeans said yes, again higher than the US figure of 61 per cent.
But Americans seem more optimistic about their own immediate economic future despite the current doldrums: 54 per cent said that they will be better off 10 years from now.
In contrast, only 41 per cent of Insight's survey respondents felt that their economic circumstances would be better in a decade. An equal number thought it would be 'worse and somewhat worse'.
On the Americans' optimism about their children's standard of living, Economic Society vice-president Yeoh Lam Keong points out that the United States is wealthier than Singapore, 'so it makes sense that people there feel that their standards of living may not be going up as much'.
However, he adds that it is probably 'fair to say that compared to other Asian societies with similar levels of wealth and consumption, such as Taiwan, Singaporeans have more faith in the system'.
The Insight finding that Singaporeans are buoyant about the future but cautious over the immediate economic outlook echoes the findings from a 2001 survey of over 2,000 Singaporeans spearheaded by National University of Singapore (NUS) sociologist Tan Ern Ser.
In that survey, eight in 10 agreed that 'Singapore is a good place to raise children', but when asked what they thought their financial situation would be in five years' time, only 33 per cent said it would be 'better than now'.
Then, Prof Tan wrote that questions about their children's futures 'deal with a more deep-seated belief in Singapore as an entity, and is therefore not easily influenced by economic fluctuation'.
He believes that the Insight findings reflect the same reasoning, adding that this was surprising to him 'given the negative vibes over the last two years about the cost of living and the influx of immigrants'.
This seems to suggest that in spite of present difficulties, Singaporeans 'are confident that the economy has remained resilient, notwithstanding economic fluctuations, particularly when compared to other regions in the world'.
'If this figure indeed correctly captures Singaporeans' sentiment about Singapore, it suggests that Singaporeans still think of Singapore as a viable entity,' he says.
The meritocratic way
WHEN it comes to the factors that boost people up the socio- economic ladder, most respondents said 'hard work' and the 'attitudes and values a person's parents taught them' were the most important. Then came 'a person's drive and ambition' and 'quality education'.
But 84 per cent of respondents flagged 'knowing the right people' as key, more than the 78 per cent who flagged 'getting a degree or diploma' - a sign, say experts, that the invisible social capital that patterns mature societies is becoming more apparent.
'In an era of academic credentialism, where 'everyone' now has a degree, people are realising that formal qualifications are not enough, and that these may have to be supplemented by informal strategies,' says NUS sociologist Vincent Chua.
In a study of 656 Singaporeans, Dr Chua found that these strategies take different forms in a meritocratic country. Those who said they got their jobs through a connection actually had lower earnings, as having to pull strings in a meritocratic context may actually signal a lack of qualifications.
But it was those with the most 'potential social capital' - in the form of knowing university graduates or private home-dwellers - who were most successful in getting jobs in the public sector, the most meritocratic labour market in Singapore.
So, Dr Chua argues that it is being 'embedded' in resource-rich networks, rather than the active mobilisation of job connections itself, that boost people upwards in a meritocracy.
This awareness of how social capital and family background entrench opportunities for success was displayed among the low-skilled and mid-skilled respondents to the survey.
For example, 97 per cent of low-skilled respondents said that 'knowing the right people' was key in advancing upwards, compared to 77 per cent of high-skilled respondents.
But the less well-off groups were not disillusioned yet: 100 per cent of low-skilled respondents said that hard work was more important, as did 94 per cent of mid-skilled respondents and 90 per cent of high-skilled respondents.
Belief that hard work will pay off was also as high among those aged 20 to 29 as those older, a sign that faith in the system is not fading with time.
'The belief in meritocracy is as strong in the low-income as in the high, the young and the old,' says Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP Zainal Sapari. 'There is no permanent underclass because we believe in this system of meritocracy.'
The worrying gap
BUT a meritocratic system in a society with a large income gap eventually 'reinforces inequality', says NUS sociologist Irene Ng. For example, local schools are largely merit-based; results decide admission.
'But that first leg into a good school gets you much better results,' she notes. 'So that's why people try so hard to get their children into good preschools. The truth is that our school system has got many different types of schools with different resources.'
According to Insight's survey, this is not lost on average Singaporeans. A stark consensus of 83 per cent of respondents said that the income gap would affect social mobility.
Last year, Singapore's Gini coefficient - a standard measure of inequality - was 0.473, one of the highest among developed nations.
Seven out of 10 respondents said that they worried about this chasm between rich and poor; 61 per cent felt that the Government was not doing enough to help people move upwards.
Dr Ng is surprised by the finding as the level of support for more government help is much higher than in other countries.
In Britain, for example, a British Social Attitudes survey conducted last year saw over 70 per cent of respondents say that the gap between rich and poor was too large. But only 34 per cent of British respondents said that the Government should redistribute income from the better-off to the less well-off, a four-point drop since 2000.
'In countries like the US and Britain, there are a lot of people who are politically conservative who will not say that the Government should do more,' she says.
Nominated MP Laurence Lien suggests that the clear consensus on greater government help from Insight's survey may have to do with the perception that 'the Government is rich and can afford it'.
The presence of the national reserves may prevent Singaporeans from making a link between 'higher social spending' and 'higher taxes for me', notes the former civil servant, who believes that 'there should be a conversation on tapping more of the reserves for social spending'.
The Government may find that it cannot have a conversation on higher taxes before conducting one on its coffers, he adds.
Insight interviewed a dozen high-income individuals and found that the bulk of them indeed believe that the Government should help the poor more, but that the current taxation structure should not change.
While most did not object outright to paying higher taxes, they emphasise that it should not be the first option.
Ms Yvonne Chan, a 30-year-old educator, notes for example that the National Health Service in Britain, for all its flaws, 'is definitely something we can learn from'.
'If taxes had to be increased, the Government will need to be very transparent about how they bridge the gap between the rich and the rest,' she adds.
But there were also those like Mr Gavin Woo, 44, a managing director who makes $400,000 a year, who say they will walk the talk.
'I'm willing to bear heavier taxes. If I can help others in any way, such as through paying more taxes so the Government can put in place more financial aid schemes, then I'm fine with that.
'There will never be enough money for the rich, and likewise for the poor. If the taxes result in more families being helped, then why not?'
Singaporeans who think like Mr Woo, says Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Lily Neo, are more common than is sometimes made out to be.
'This survey shows that the majority of Singaporeans will support the Government spending more on this group. And we can do it without Singaporeans saying, why are you spending on them and not on me?'
Mr Yeoh of the Economic Society says Insight's findings are significant because the respondents' perceptions are corroborated by empirical studies which show that a big income gap is a significant predictor of low social mobility.
The survey findings show that Singaporeans want the Government to intervene to keep society mobile in the face of a growing income gap.
For Mr Li, though, his faith in the system is still strong. He has no doubt his children's future will be brighter than his.
He says: 'There may be more competition, for example, for university places. But there are also more universities now. There is still so much opportunity in Singapore.'

COMPARING BY AGE DIVIDE
SINGAPOREANS aged 30-39 are the most pessimistic about their children's chances of success. Some 45 per cent think their children's opportunities to succeed will be worse than theirs. Those aged 50 and older are the most optimistic.
Sociologist Vincent Chua said people in their 30s may seem less upbeat as they are still trying to establish their careers. '30-39 can be a very stressful time, having to juggle both a young family and work, coupled with conditions specific to Singapore, particular immigration,' he said.
Engineer Daniel Lee, 34, who has a four-year-old daughter, said: 'In Singapore it's very hard to get by. As a parent, most of us are concerned about the cost of child care, and education.'
COMPARING BY SKILLS DIVIDE
THE high-skilled, which includes professionals and managers, are a tad gloomier about their prospects than the low-skilled. Only four in 10 think they will be better off 10 years from now.
The low-skilled, which includes cleaners and labourers, are slightly more optimistic. Some 45 per cent think their economic situation will improve.
Nominated MP Laurence Lien believes 'the reality of hope' is what makes the low-skilled optimistic.
Housewife Chaw Song Moy, 45, who has two daughters aged 21 and 18, and lives in a three-room flat, said: 'I'm sure they will have a better life. How can I not hope for that? As long as they can find a job it's fine... as long as they can do well, I have no worries.'
COMPARING BY RACE DIVIDE
MALAYS are more optimistic than the other races about their children's future. Some 73 per cent say their children will have better chances to succeed in life than they did. And 81 per cent feel their children will have a higher standard of living.
As for their economic situation 10 years from now, Malays are also the most hopeful. A 2001 study by sociologist Tan Ern Ser also found them more optimistic than others. That study asked people about their finances over the next five years.
Mendaki researcher Muhammad Nadim Adam said more Malays have made it past primary school in the last 10 years. He said: '(It) may contribute to the overall optimism that their children will have a better chance to succeed in life than them.'
COMPARING BY EDUCATION DIVIDE
THOSE with a diploma or degree generally feel secure about being able to afford a comfortable lifestyle.
In the survey, 74 per cent of respondents in this category expect to earn enough money, but only 61 per cent of those with A-level certificates and below share this confidence.
For those with A-level education or lower, 39 per cent expect to struggle to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.
Odd job labourer Mohd Shyam Hassan, 43, feels his lack of education is a major hurdle to finding work to pay the bills. 'I had only primary school education and my English is not so good. I went to prison and came from a family with a lot of problems. It's hard for people like me if we have no certificates.'

"," The niggling question for an ongoing festival of drama doyen Kuo Pao Kun's works, is whether his plays still connect with Gen Y and millenial audiences who were untouched by Kuo when he was alive.
Shakespeare's tragic hero Hamlet said: 'The play's the thing.' Indeed it is so in the case of the Bard. Generations of theatre-makers and audiences have poured themselves into his tragedies, romances and comedies, while having only the foggiest idea of who William Shakespeare was.
But it is not simply because of his scripts that Kuo was acknowledged as Singapore's most influential dramatist in the 1980s and 1990s.
The bilingual playwright and director, who died of liver cancer in 2002, acquired his moral authority from his lifelong commitment to the arts and strong social consciousness, despite having been detained for four years in the late 1970s for alleged communist activities. He was a bridge- builder between different communities and a thinker who set up the first performing arts school, arts centre and inter-cultural theatre programme.
Few theatre practitioners and cultural workers over the age of 35 are unaffected by Kuo. Some of what he stood for is captured in the 20-odd plays he wrote, but a fuller picture can be gleaned only by reading them together with his commentaries and interviews, which have recently been collected and published.
His two most enduring plays so far, The Coffin Is Too Big For The Hole and Descendants Of The Eunuch Admiral, are small works rather than large-scale productions, philosophical sketches and social allegories rather than sweeping and fully fleshed-out dramas.
This has not stopped younger theatre practitioners from finding new resonances in them. For Descendants, a play about castration and corporate serfs, Ong Keng Sen's 1995 English version, with its striking imagery of spinning actors, and Taiwanese director Poo Hong-chen's layered Mandarin remix in 2003 come to mind.
Nonetheless, the absence of an epic production in Kuo's repertory has limited his appeal here largely to artists and intellectuals. It also makes him a tough sell to the young, who are spoilt for choice in entertainment and are no longer so drawn to the theatre for self-expression like their Gen X predecessors.
Interestingly, a new staging of Lao Jiu The Musical meets these challenges head-on and succeeds surprisingly well with one of the doyen's more dated plays. Now running at the Drama Centre Theatre, it is deservedly the centrepiece of a year-long festival coinciding with the 10th anniversary of Kuo's death.
Lao Jiu, about the artistic aspirations of the ninth child and only son in a working-class family, was written originally as a play. It features a large cast as well as realistic characters and dialogue. It was staged here in Mandarin in 1990, and in English in 1993, to critical acclaim. The general feeling then was it had captured the social pressures facing younger Singaporeans who yearned to ditch the paper chase and pursue their dreams.
Before his death, Kuo had the idea that Lao Jiu - with its moments of levity and seriousness - might work as a musical. In 2005, his director daughter Jian Hong took a stab at creating that musical, but was unsatisfied with the result. In a recent interview, she called that production 'a play with music, not a musical'.
The current Mandarin production by the Kuos' theatre company, Theatre Practice, pulls out all the stops. It has the younger Kuo at the helm, better versed with the genre after directing three previous musicals. It has an original score written by the leading lights of the country's Mandopop scene, composer Eric Ng and lyricist Xiao Han.
It also has a carefully selected cast comprising stage veterans from past Lao Jiu productions (Goh Guat Kian and Lim Kay Siu) and younger theatre and music professionals (actor Jeffrey Low, talent- show finalist Sugie and singer-songwriter Inch Chua). It also has Channel 8 host and comedian Marcus Chin giving the performance of his life as Lao Jiu's weather- beaten father, pushed to the edge by his son's seeming recalcitrance. The result is a near-seamless fusion of song, dance and incisive drama, that overcomes at least two rather outdated premises.
One is the idea that it is difficult to become an artist in Singapore. The other is the fraught dynamic between baby- boomer Singaporean parents of little means who invested everything in the Singapore dream of meritocracy and money, and their children who chafed at that determinism but also feared disappointing them. Artists are now everywhere and receive relatively generous funding, while baby-boomers have become indulgent grandparents. Today's parents are less dogmatic, in a society flush with affluence and multiple career options.
But what makes Kuo's script still potent is that it is not simply about the alienation felt by artists or the 1980s generation gap, but a deeper struggle between idealism and pragmatism, activism and passivity. When Lao Jiu says he longs to be a traditional puppet-master rather than a fast-track scholar hemmed in by a bond, it resonates in the heart of everyone who has felt the tension between striking out and sticking to the unquestioning, well-trodden path.
When the elderly puppet-master tells Lao Jiu he is resigned to his art of puppetry becoming a museum piece, he is symbolic of an older generation whose brand of wisdom is sometimes seen as inimical to technocratic progress in a fast-changing society. Such poignant portrayals of the elderly recur in Kuo's plays.
In bringing out these themes, the production has created a socially conscious musical, and one that speaks to all ages. Hopefully, its mix of entertainment and commentary will give it legs and bring Kuo's works to a wider audience.

"," Scandals
"," ALTHOUGH deputy editor Zuraidah Ibrahim makes many good points in her commentary on Sunday (""Scrubbing out sleaze in Singapore"") on recent corruption scandals, in particular, the need for a more watchful, engaged public, I am surprised by one of her conclusions that ""everything that has happened in the past six months has shown that the system still works"".
In fact, the scandals have exposed some flaws.
Singapore has prided itself on an elite system of talent selection and career progression.
Meritocracy and intense scrutiny together produce only the best leaders, or so we have been told.
The sex-for-business allegations against the former chiefs of the Central Narcotics Bureau and the Singapore Civil Defence Force, if true, suggest otherwise.
Singaporean meritocracy may, in reality, inflate the egos of those who succeed such that their sense of entitlement and privilege can supersede their better judgment.
Meanwhile, their followers, by virtue of finishing second or third, may lose the self-confidence and gumption needed to keep No. 1 on his toes.
In other words, our Darwinian selection system is partly behind the inordinate power structures one might find in Singapore organisations.
Second, although Ms Zuraidah cheers the effectiveness of Singaporean justice and vigilance in bringing these cases to light, she admits that the probe into the National Parks Board's Brompton bicycle purchase was prompted only after Internet grumblings could no longer be ignored.
Hence, here again the system would have failed if not for the tireless - and purely voluntary - work of netizens.
It is good that the public is having a lively post-mortem on these scandals.
We must be honest about the potential problems in our system if we are going to address them.

"," Corruption
"," There are corrupt individuals in Singapore, as in all societies, but the difference is that an effective system is in place here to keep a tight lid on graft, Law Minister K. Shanmugam said last night.
He also defended Singapore's system of meritocracy, dismissing the notion that it was a reason for the recent spate of high-profile corruption cases involving public officers.
He told 1,800 residents at a National Day dinner in Chong Pang that he was raising the issue of corruption for two reasons.
First, a letter writer in The Straits Times Forum Page last Thursday referred to recent high-profile corruption cases and suggested that meritocracy was a possible cause of graft. Letter writer Sudhir Thomas Vadaketh argued that meritocracy ""may inflate the egos of those who succeed such that their sense of entitlement and privilege can supersede their better judgment"".
Dismissing that suggestion as ""absurd"", Mr Shanmugam said: ""If the gentleman is right, that in order to reduce corruption, we must do away with meritocracy, does it mean that less meritocracy means less corruption?
""So the table of countries with the highest corruption, they must all be highly meritocratic, and all the countries which rank high on meritocracy must all rank high on the corruption index as well?
""It's an absurd statement and you can show the absurdity by drawing these conclusions.""
He said the second reason he was raising the issue was that in recent months junior college students and undergraduates had asked him repeatedly why Singapore had so many graft cases if it is supposed to be a clean country, and high pay for public officers should eradicate corruption.
His answer: It is human nature.
""In every society from time immemorial, corruption, falling for temptation, basic vices - these have existed. You see them referred to even in the scriptures, whether you take the Bible or any other scriptures... (or) any history book from the ancient times,"" he said.
""It's because it is basic human nature. We in Singapore somehow are not special, superior beings. We are also human... There is no society in the world, in the past or the present, in which every person is totally clean."" But Singapore was different from other countries, he said. The political leadership had in the last 55 years ""emphasised moral rectitude and correct conduct in public service"".
""And if anyone breaches that, he is likely to be found out and severe punishment is certain for those who are guilty,"" he added.
Also, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, which reports directly to the Prime Minister, is highly effective. It relies on insiders, internal audits and tip-offs, such as in the case of the National Parks Board's purchase of Brompton foldable bicycles.
Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao first raised the alarm and National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan ordered an internal audit that uncovered discrepancies, ""long before specific issues were raised by netizens"", he said.
Likewise, an internal audit uncovered irregularities involving former Chief of Protocol Lim Cheng Hoe, said Mr Shanmugam, who is also Foreign Affairs Minister.
""We have created a system which is highly effective. It cannot eradicate bad behaviour but it can substantially reduce corruption... and bad behaviour.""
He said his 20 years practising law taught him that rules and systems cannot eradicate fraud and bad conduct. Singapore will always have its share of corrupt people, he said, citing the late minister Teh Cheang Wan, former minister of state Wee Toon Boon, and former Trade Development Board chief executive officer Yeo Seng Teck.
But corruption here will not be like in other places where people face corrupt officials in their daily lives.
He said: ""That is why year after year after year, we rank as one of the cleanest, least corrupt societies in the world and we will continue to be so as long as we have this system in place.""
Asked later by reporters about talk that the quick succession of graft cases before the courts was timed after the General Election in May last year, the minister rejected such allegations as ""groundless"". He said the cases took place and were found out at different times based on internal audits and tip-offs.
He said: ""To suggest there is a linkage to the elections is just absurd.""

"," Mr Aravinth Kumarasamy, 46, was born in Sri Lanka, but he feels most at home in Singapore, especially when he hears Tamil announcements in MRT trains.
""It makes you feel included,"" said the creative director of Apsaras Arts, a performing arts company set up here in 1977 by celebrated Singaporean choreographer Neila Sathyalingam.
Mr Aravinth was twice forced to flee his home - first from Colombo in 1983 and then in 1985 from Batticaloa in eastern Sri Lanka - because of the civil war that raged in the country from 1983 to 2009.
Part of the Tamil minority in the Sinhalese majorityruled island, he migrated to Singapore in 1987. Given his background, he does not take racial harmony, or meritocracy, for granted.
""I came here with no connections. I didn't go to a certain elite school or pull strings with certain people, but I still got a chance to work with different people and get to places,"" said the musician.
In 1999, he received a Young Artist Award (Music) from the National Arts Council, the same year that he received his pink identity card. ""We came to Singapore because it is modern, progressive and Asian at heart. It has connections with Indian artists, which is important to me,"" he said.
He came here with his parents - his father, Kumarasamy, 74, a retired engineer, his mother, Swarna, 69, a housewife, and sister Gayathri Sivarajah, a vocalist and dancer, 40. His wife, Pavithra Dayanandan, 39, is a housewife and they have a daughter, Madhumitha, six.
He founded the first Indian school orchestra at Raffles Girls' School in 1997, and went on to form Singapore's first youth Indian orchestra in Kolam Ayer Community Club in 1999.The orchestra has been disbanded but its members have joined the Singapore Indian Orchestra and Choir.
Mr Aravinth's works have been performed in New York, Sydney, Colombo and Chennai. He holds a music degree (1987) from the University of Madras and is formally trained in vocals, veena (a traditional Indian plucked string instrument) and the bharatanatyam dance form.
But he is most well-known as a composer, conductor and creator of theatre productions under the auspices of Apsaras.
His latest production, Nirmanika: Beauty Of Architecture, which explores architecture through bharatanatyam classical dance form, played to full houses at the Esplanade Theatre Studio last November and toured in London and Sri Lanka. It will be performed at Indika, a music and dance festival in Liverpool, England, on Aug 17, and tour India in October.
The work celebrates ancient monuments such as India's Taj Mahal and Indonesia's Borobudur, but does not feature Singapore buildings. ""Singapore's are not monuments, they are buildings. It would be quite funny to produce a dance about Raffles Hotel,"" he said with a laugh.
He defines Singapore by its multiculturalism. ""My Sri Lankan friends who have emigrated to other countries, such as England for example, all have only Sri Lankan friends. In Singapore, I have Chinese, Malay and Caucasian friends.
""When Nirmanika was staged at the Esplanade Theatre Studio, we were sold out to a multicultural audience,"" said the man, who is also a co-founder of Sambaash, a social media software platform provider.
""The best thing about Singapore is that it is a hub for many things. I get inspiration from Malay and Chinese cultures, and I get to watch international performances such as Bolshoi Ballet here. This sort of experience is not common in Sri Lanka and India,"" he said.

"," Cities
"," FEW would have believed on this day in 1965 that a city, ejected and separated from its economic hinterland, would in years to come be hearing not existential debates but the dialectics of growth. Managing success can be almost as taxing as averting failure, the nation is learning. Once the basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health and education have been largely met, demands for a better standard of living metamorphose into expectations of a higher quality of life. Responding to these higher-order expectations, the state invested more in social development and the arts, and opened up forums of consultation to promote interaction.
In retrospect, the guiding principles evolved and the national institutions built up - like the Housing and Development Board, Central Provident Fund and Economic Development Board - have enabled an improbable nation to withstand challenges from within and without and to become something of an international buzzword for a model of a global city that works.
Today, concerns over a widening income gap, social mobility and immigration have led to some discussion in Singapore on ""rethinking the social compact"". The argument is that a maturing economy, globalisation and profound demographic changes are making it difficult to achieve an equitable distribution of the fruits of success.
In any recalibration of the compass, however, it is important to take note of the fundamental values that underpin Singapore society. Considerable risk lies in placing undue reliance on models, systems or ideas that have been untested in a city with scant natural resources, a diverse ethnic mix and a not-always friendly neighbourhood. Having come thus far, Singapore will have to blaze its own path.
The Republic is close to celebrating half a century of survival against the odds because the existing social compact has served it well. Predicated on the reality that Singapore has to stand on its own, a balance was struck between individual responsibility and social security. Its institutions have been characterised by prudence in emphasing efficiency, integrity and long-term planning. They operate within a wider culture of probity and accountability in public life and cases of corruption are dealt with expeditiously. The system, of course, is not perfect, because human nature is not.
It is timely on National Day to reflect on and reaffirm Singapore's commitment to its founding values of multiracialism and meritocracy, and its hopes of forging a democratic society, based on justice and equality, as one united people. These words resonate today and should continue to guide the national conversation on the way forward.

"," More than just HDB flats, MRT lines and sound policies, what makes Singapore home are values like love of country and integrity, which Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong hopes can be strengthened.
To realise his vision of Singapore as ""a home with hope and with a heart"", Mr Lee said the Government is working to improve both hardware and software, but ""most important... is to build and strengthen our heartware, how we feel about Singapore"".
""These are the spirit, the values, the emotional ties which make us Singaporeans, make Singapore what it is and make us proud to be Singaporeans,"" he said in a National Day dinner speech to 2,000 residents of Teck Ghee in Ang Mo Kio GRC.
He spoke of love for the nation and loyalty to Singapore, care and compassion for fellow citizens, mutual respect, sincerity and consideration for one another.
It means giving way to a senior citizen on the MRT so he can sit down, helping someone who falls, and handing a lost wallet to the police with honesty, ""things which need to come from the heart, from Singaporeans themselves, which is what makes Singapore a good place to live"", he said.
Tourists, too, should be impressed not only by the Marina Bay skyline and HDB estates, but also by the friendly cabby who ""can explain to them why he is proud of Singapore"", and by helpful Singaporeans.
In the wake of graft scandals involving civil servants, Mr Lee also emphasised integrity and ""upholding our system of zero corruption, of high-quality officers, of people carrying out their duty"".
Finally, Singapore must remain a meritocracy, where people are recognised by their contributions and what they can do for Singapore, and not by race, language, family background or wealth.
""We must develop these attributes, not through laws or fines, but by nurturing these values in everyone, so that they are reflected in our lives, in our actions, in our concerns, in what we expect of one another and become part of what it means when we say, 'I am a Singaporean'.""
He invited Singaporeans to play their part to realise the vision, saying the Government could not do it alone.
A key element is closer families and communities, and he has re-organised government to better focus on these two priorities. Residents also can join in beautifying their neighbourhood, he added.
In Ang Mo Kio GRC, where Mr Lee is an MP, 10 more blocks have been selected for the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme and residents will have a say in the common facilities they want, like senior citizens' corners, playgrounds or street soccer courts.
He asked them to support the programme, and assured them that the Government will fund it fully.
In a speech in Mandarin, he called on residents to welcome residential homes and day-care facilities for the elderly. He signalled that Ang Mo Kio and Teck Ghee wards will need the facilities as residents age, but added that there are no concrete plans for them yet.
His speech in Malay touched on change too. Singapore must keep pace with global developments in the next 20 years, he said, urging Malay-Muslims here to develop together with other communities.
In closing, he rallied everyone to work together, ""not only to be a prosperous or a modern society, but (also) a decent and caring people, so that we can be even prouder of being Singaporeans.""
After listening to Mr Lee's speech, nurse manager Anbalagam Punithavathi, 46, spoke of what makes her proud to be Singaporean.
She believes people of different races here care for and respect one another. ""You don't see this in many other parts of the world.""

"," I refer to When Bosses Have To Serve (SundayLife!, Aug 12). I am a French citizen and Singapore permanent resident who has been in the hospitality industry for the past 30 years, 10 of which have been in Singapore.
Currently, we are bringing in a substantial investment from outside Singapore to create three food and beverage concepts that will, in time, be distributed around the world. However, we are going to have to rethink this plan because there is a serious manpower crunch in Singapore. Manpower within this industry has always been an issue but it is certainly getting worse rather than better.
I would love to hire many Singaporeans to work in my businesses - that is, if they turn up. When advertisements are answered and interviews scheduled, the Singaporeans who put up their names for jobs do not reply. If they do reply and an interview is scheduled, they do not turn up.
If they do start work, chances are high that they will get a medical certificate and in a short time quit in search of the next best thing.
We have 17 positions available at our first restaurant which is scheduled to open in three weeks. At present, we have only three Singaporean full-time employees. The new ruling on foreign workers quota does not allow us to employ the many qualified foreigners available to do the job.
Wherever the Singaporeans looking for these jobs are, we need them to step forward now. How can we complain about service standards when there is no standard to begin with?
Lara Jay Hequet
I am the owner of a local coffee-shop chain which is facing a challenge in staffing our 13 outlets across Singapore. We have had multiple opportunities to expand our brand at new locations but we had to put those plans on hold due to the changes to the foreign worker quota that took effect on July 1.
Many people will say we should pay Singaporeans more to lure them to take up service jobs. But Singapore is a meritocracy. If we have people of different nationalities earning different salaries for doing the same job, there will be discontent at the workplace.
Imagine giving an increase of just $50 in salary for all 100 staff. That would be $5,000 off our bottom line, excluding CPF contributions and overtime rates and bonuses. This would be on top of rising outlet rentals and raw material costs.
Jack Poon
The manpower shortage is a chronic problem not only in F&B, but also in other industries such as in retail.
As small retail business owners, our short-term solution is to pay our workers wages above the market average. But that does not solve the problem in the long run. We have tried to inculcate a sense of belonging in our workers, shortening the working hours on some days for company events such as barbecues, movie nights and dinners. However, that can be draining on finances as we still have to pay overheads such as rent and salaries.
Despite the efforts that we have put in, the turnover rate for locals is still very high. The reality is that Singapore is small and the pool of willing workers limited.
Will bringing in more foreigners to work in the industry solve the problem? I really doubt it.
The service industry needs to get its act together and change the public perception that a retail job is ""too hard"". It is going to be an uphill task, but it has to be done.
Cecilia Teh
There is a need to increase the foreign worker quota to ease the shortage of not only service staff, but also kitchen staff.
Kitchen staff usually start work much earlier, their job environment can be hot and sweaty, and they have to carry weights of 20kg or more.
Businesses end up paying them more, without any increase in productivity, due to competition for the limited supply of workers willing to do the job.
One policy shortfall is that foreign workers can change jobs anytime, subject to the approval of a new work permit because foreign workers are not required to work a minimum period before switching jobs.
We often have work permit holders who quit after less than three months to take up jobs that pay them more. As a result, our investment in their training goes down the drain, time is wasted, costs go up and we are still short of workers.
Yeo Enghuat
The manpower crunch in the F&B industry has been a longstanding issue. If Singaporeans do not want to work, then let foreigners take over. Increase the ratio of foreigners to Singaporeans that we can employ so that businesses can survive and diners can enjoy their dining experience.
Singaporeans can complain all they want about foreigners taking their jobs, but the truth of the matter is that Singaporeans want foreigners to do the ""hard"" or ""dirty"" jobs, such as being construction workers, maids and nurses.
What we need to learn is that hard work is rewarded and laziness is not. You cannot hold a management position without the experience or knowledge of what it takes.
If there were fewer jobs available for Singaporeans, then they would feel less inclined to quit on a whim because it would not be so easy to find another job.

"," Middle age; Gross Domestic Product--GDP
","   Singapore turned 47 this year. If the tone of public conversations on and offline is anything to go by, the country is in the throes of a midlife crisis.
And about time too.
Midlife in the human context is the period between ages 40 and 60, when many go through a process of re-evaluating their lives.
For some, midlife is a smooth progression from the drive and ambitions of youth through the maturity of middle age straight to the calm satisfaction of old age. For others, it can be a period of discontinuity, characterised by a distinct break, a sharp turn, and then a continuation on a totally different trajectory along the journey of life.
For the latter group, influential Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung's description of midlife will resonate: ""Wholly unprepared, we embark upon the second half of life... we take the step into the afternoon of life; worse still, we take this step with the false assumption that our truths and ideals will serve as before.
""But we cannot live the afternoon of life according to the programme of life's morning - for what was great in the morning will be little at evening, and what in the morning was true will at evening have become a lie.""
After nearly five decades of material progress, Singapore is going through a period of soul-searching unprecedented since Independence.
Like a person going through a midlife crisis, the nation is questioning what once worked. What was once taken for granted as articles of faith, are being disputed.
Two key tenets undergirding the nation's success and stability in the first 46 years are being scrutinised.
The first is economic primacy.
A single-minded focus on economic growth has made Singapore very rich - in fact, according to various rankings by global organisations it is among the very richest countries in the world, if judged by its GDP per capita.
In the trade-offs between environment, heritage conservation or equity on the one hand, and economic development on the other, it has usually been the latter that has taken precedence. Hence the rapid transformation of green spaces and the clearing of rural areas into urban centres; the acquisition of private lands and properties by the state in the public interest to build roads, schools or homes; and the rapid influx of foreign workers to speed growth in recent years.
But there has been an intensifying level of unhappiness at such trade-offs, culminating in last year's watershed General Election.
Like a man who climbed the rungs to reach the apex of material success only to wonder if he was even scaling the right ladder, Singapore is today wondering if the costs of such rapid economic progress have been worth the price.
Singapore may stand at the top of the ladder of per capita GDP growth; but did it get there by trampling on some of its own family members? Did we do damage to our own kin in our race to be top?
This is a difficult issue to confront, yet confront it Singapore must, in order to get consensus on the way ahead.
It may be that after reflection and debate, we decide that economics must remain supreme, as the No.1 priority, without which there would be no viable Singapore nation. Or we may decide that other values like cohesion and justice matter just as much, and find a way to strike a better balance.
The second key tenet being questioned by Singapore in its midlife crisis is the political primacy of the People's Action Party.
The PAP's detractors may not care to admit it, but most fair-minded Singaporeans would agree that this country would be a very different - and likely lousier - place without the PAP. The men in white stamped the nation with the foundational values of meritocracy, intolerance of corruption, and multi- racial tolerance that are still held dear today by many.
That the PAP has done much good for Singapore is incontrovertible. But the PAP's formulation of itself as the only party that can govern Singapore well is being contested. So too is the declaration by some PAP leaders that it is good for Singapore to have a dominant party system (with the PAP being the obvious dominant party in the system).
Some PAP leaders have argued that competitive politics that bring Singapore closer to a two-party or multi-party system will spell the end of the golden era for Singapore. But an increasing number of Singaporeans aren't sold on that idea, as seen in the numbers who vote for non-PAP parties.
The citizenry, who once happily traded voice and participation for material security, wants to renegotiate the social contract, leaving the PAP blind-sided by the rapidity of the change in mood.
You might say the situation is akin to that of a marriage, where one party in the government-people relationship is going through an intense period of questioning and self-doubt, while the hapless partner stands by wondering how best to cope.
If they go through midlife transition together, a couple can emerge stronger. But sometimes, the spouse going through a midlife crisis embarks on a spiritual journey of self-discovery and realises her values have changed. If the other party remains the same, they find their values no longer gel, and the marriage is doomed.
The PAP has read the mood of the people after the last GE and has promised change. It has acknowledged that there is a rupture in the smooth state-people relationship. One only has to recall the iconic moment in last year's General Election when the Prime Minister apologised for the mistakes of his administration.
That moment of epiphany is akin to the ""aha!"" moment when a husband suddenly realises his wife is unhappy despite being provided for. But he still doesn't quite understand why, let alone know what he has to do to make her happy and to make the marriage work.
While Singaporeans go through soul-searching and re-evaluate their priorities, will the PAP do likewise? Of course individual PAP members are all Singaporeans, and have every interest in how the country develops. But the PAP as the incumbent political party has vested interests in remaining in power and well ahead of its rivals out to unseat it, whereas not all citizens are enamoured with that vision. Will the PAP be able to keep pace with the values and changing priorities of a new generation of Singaporeans, if they no longer think the PAP should maintain political primacy?
As of now, there is no other political party capable of winning majority support. The Workers' Party may have won six elected parliamentary seats, but it has been thrown into disarray by a spate of recent departures. Intellectually and policy-wise, it has not shown itself capable of keeping up with, let alone setting, the national agenda.
This means that if voters deny the PAP the political primacy it desires, there will be a vacuum in political leadership.
This is the danger in Singapore's midlife crisis: that the status quo is thrown over, and there is nothing strong to replace it with.
It's like a woman in the throes of midlife crisis, who seeks to reclaim her lost youth and turns away from her steady middle-age husband to the embrace of an exotic hunk, hoping to find in excitement and novelty a balm to soothe the turmoil and confusion within. When the self-destructive cycle ends and she comes to her senses, the trust may have been irreparably broken, and the marriage destroyed.
A people's relationship with the political regime of the day is of course not a marriage. And a country is not an individual.
But metaphors can help us gain insight.
Singapore's period of soul searching is only just beginning. I think the conversation around whether economics should reign supreme, can find a consensus. But the question of the PAP's continued political dominance is far more divisive - and carries far greater risks for the country's stability.

","   THE national conversation on the future of Singapore will be first and foremost about putting Singaporeans at the heart of the country's concerns, said Minister for Education Heng Swee Keat.
It will be an opportunity for Singaporeans to come together and ask what matters most and where they want to go as a people, he added. In short, it will seek to ""reaffirm, recalibrate and refresh"", he said.
He set out yesterday the guiding principle of the national conversation he has been tasked to lead, as chief of a committee to engage Singaporeans in taking a fresh look at policies and discuss the future Singapore they want.
The committee has yet to be formed. But in his first National Day Rally speech, ahead of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's address, Mr Heng urged all Singaporeans to get involved in the national effort, ""including those who normally stay silent"".
Mr Lee later painted in broad strokes the dramatic backdrop awaiting Singapore as countries change, technology advances and events within Singapore evolve.
While Singapore's economic leap from Third World to First World is well known, he asked: ""What is the next chapter of this story? Where do we want Singapore to be 20 years from now?""
One major factor will be technological change. Casting his mind to 20 years ago, he noted that national service recruits used coins and phone cards to make calls home. Now, they use cellphones.
The Internet did not exist in Singapore in 1992. Today, Singapore is one of the most wired countries in the world.
""So just think back to those 20 years and ask yourself: 'How you can imagine what 20 years from now will be like?' Not just the technology, but what the technology has done to our lives?""
Entire industries will change, some jobs will disappear, others will be redesigned. The social norms of how people communicate and interact with one another will also evolve, he said.
He gave a glimpse of some technologies that he thinks will have a major impact: unmanned aerial vehicles that one day, may even be used by Singapore Airlines to fly passengers, and machines that can be controlled by brain waves.
Domestically, a more mature economy, an ageing society and a better educated population are already changing Singapore.
But whatever the global and domestic trends, the future of Singapore is not predetermined. ""It depends on ourselves: what we make of our resources, our education, our people. What we hope Singapore will be and what we will Singapore to become.
""What we decide, we want to be there, let's get there. We have to set a clear direction, we cannot just be blown off course or drift with the tides onto the rocks.""
On his decision to have three new office-holders speak at the Rally, Mr Lee said he wanted ""fresh people, fresh voices and fresh ideas for Singapore"". He indicated that others may be invited to speak at future Rallies.
Meanwhile, Mr Heng, in outlining what he hopes to achieve in the national conversation, stressed that it must reaffirm what is good and relevant about the fundamentals in Singapore.
But some strengths can be overdone, he warned, and added: ""Extreme meritocracy and competition can lead to a winner-take-all-society, with the winners thinking little of others.
""We need to restore a balance to hard-nosed material pragmatism,"" he said.
Observers see the new format as a bid to make the national conversation open and inclusive.
Said Nominated MP Nicholas Fang: ""Calling it a conversation suggests the emphasis is going to be on being more interactive, and a sincere reflection of what people are truly worried about.""
Undergraduate Han Dong, 23, said the changes ahead will give young Singaporeans more options in their career, lifestyle and family choices: ""So if people want their options to be taken into consideration, they need to take part in the conversation.""
Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Inderjit Singh said that while Mr Lee had set broadly, a direction for the future Singapore, ""it is still wide open for everyone to come in"".

","   OLDER Singaporeans will recall how Mr Lee Kuan Yew's 1960s refrain of a rugged society inspired the people to overcome the odds in the difficult years. After the nation got over the hump, the buzzword was resilience. This was the consolidation phase, to preserve gains against vitiation while striving for niche accomplishments in a world become borderless. A half-century on, with the status of a developed economy seemingly achieved, Singaporeans are taking a hard look in the mirror at themselves and the evolution of society. Mission accomplished? Hardly. Coming next is the maturation phase, the locus of humanity by which successful societies are judged for their attractive civilisational qualities.
A jibe is occasionally heard about Singapore having First World trappings but Third World ways. If the people do not like the characterisation, they should take steps to change it. As an aspiration, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's invitation to the people to help create a society based on decency, a generosity of spirit and respect for diversity may arguably be the hardest call thus far in the Singapore Story because any change will have to first be at a personal and individual level.
At the National Day Rally, PM Lee asked that the people shape the kind of society they want. Materialism will assuredly remain. How it can be reconciled with the striving for a less stratified society is a point to ponder offered up by Education Minister Heng Swee Keat, who also spoke. Calling for some balance to ""material pragmatism"", he noted that ""extreme meritocracy and competition can lead to a winner- take-all society, with the winners thinking little of others"". This is one illustration of the difficulties in the consensus-building that he will lead.
There are pointers. The Americans are admired for their philanthropic nature, a willingness to give aid and succour without expectation of a return. Another example: Japanese victims of the quake-tsunami disaster. They showed respect and concern for one another in the face of death and devastation. How did such character develop? In societies imbued with the right values, people do not stop to gawk at accident scenes but offer what help they can. Motorists make way for ambulances. Old people are shown courtesy, animal cruelty is unthinkable. Singapore's next level of progress is towards a comparable level of such symbolic reckoners, where material norms will no longer be the sole measure of the country's standing and a person's worth. Civil society will thrive as conduits for social support and enlightenment. This can transpire only if the image in the mirror that Singaporeans earnestly wish to see is that of big-hearted people, gracious towards one another and others.

","   I WAS heartened by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's emphasis on building a ""home with hope and heart"" at Sunday's National Day Rally speech, coming at a crucial juncture when our society ponders our future direction (""Help write the next chapter in S'pore story, says PM""; Monday).
PM Lee also highlighted several disturbing trends, such as the negative sentiments against foreigners, ugly Singaporean behaviour, and the not-in-my-backyard (Nimby) syndrome.
He stressed work-life balance, and warned against the potential loss of childhood to ""over-teaching"".
Singapore has built itself on two pillars: meritocracy and strong economic growth and prosperity, which have been described as forming the foundation for all else.
Yet, I often wonder whether much of what we decry is merely a symptom of a deeper malaise linked to these very two pillars.
In a meritocracy, there are always winners and losers. And the merit that separates the two is defined by the governing elite in society.
In Singapore, merit has been largely defined as academic success; in fact, Sunday's speeches also highlighted such instances.
Unless we redefine merit, there will always be those who fall behind. Moreover, the playing field is never really level, as a person's success depends as much on his circumstances and social capital, as his own ability.
Such a system tends to breed a self-centred, competitive, elitist society where the objective is to get ahead, with little motivation to look out for one's neighbour.
Could that explain poor public behaviour on the roads and MRT,
the Nimby syndrome, reserving parking spaces on public roads, the unfriendly attitude towards foreigners, and the relentless pre-school and tuition classes that start as young as age three?
The preoccupation with economic growth fosters a deep-seated materialism. The primary concern on employers' minds is usually the bottom line.
Work-life balance will come only when employers learn to put the well-being of their employees above profits. As a doctor, I have often seen elderly patients denied medical leave to keep their medical appointments.
Treating the symptoms alone won't do - the disease has to be cured.
Although meritocracy and economic growth have served us well, perhaps it is time to seriously recalibrate these two sacred cows in forging a new social compact, especially during the national conversation Mr Lee has directed Education Minister Heng Swee Keat to host.
Can we as a mature society imagine alternatives that will create a nation with real heart?
Winston Chin (Dr)
IN 2032, or two decades from now, seniors like me would have departed. Whether the national conversation Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong initiated on Sunday in his National Day Rally speech turns out to be the subtext of sweet nothings or a brave new world is an outcome my generation is unlikely to witness (""Help write the next chapter in S'pore story, says PM""; Monday).
Much will depend on how the conversation is conducted and whether there is a genuine desire for change. If it is a monologue, in top-down fashion, it will be a waste of time.
If the educated citizenry treat it as yet another public relations exercise and do not have the depth or gumption to speak their minds, then it may remain a dream rather than reality.
The issue of locals versus foreigners, which seems to worry our top leadership, is something which the Swiss, a role model for Singapore, scrupulously avoided by calibrating the inflow of immigrants.
The Swiss doubled their population in 100 years but we did it in less than 50. Their Gini coefficient stands at 0.34 whereas ours is at 0.47. Even when we clamour to be the hub of everything, the Swiss continue to define and defend their customs, culture and democracy.
So where will we be at the end of 2032?
Will we be like Switzerland and continue to thrive, or will we ""fold up"" as former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew had warned (""Simple choice: More babies or more migrants""; Aug 15)?
Will we be a more equal and fairer society where citizens live and connect with heart and soul; or a society dragged down by envy and materialism?
These are some of the questions which our national conversation should focus on. For the conversation to take root in reality, it should take place in every grassroots coffee shop, community centre or void deck.
By 2032, Singapore will have held at least four more general elections and what shape and colour the future government will take is anybody's guess.
We are still a nation in the making and unless we hear the warning sirens amid the chatter, we may not survive.

Foreign remakes in China
A GUARANTEE for television viewership success now in China is not just ripping off foreign hit shows, but paying licensing fees for them. The move appears to be paying off with at least 10 such shows aired last year since the first, China's Got Talent, was aired in 2010.

DOMESTIC consumption is not vigorous in China, resulting in declining sales at department stores and the closure of many retail outlets. The tepid consumption undermines the government's aim of relying on consumer spending to act as a stimulus on an economy that is cooling.

","   THE kind of meritocracy Singapore must be is a ""continuous"" one that evaluates people throughout their lives, not one where ""things are set"" based on academic performance at a young age, said Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam yesterday.
This approach requires a work culture with bridges and ladders for advancement in every job, regardless of where someone left the educational system, he told Nanyang Technological University students at a forum.
He has seen how it can be done, he said, by employers who look out for workers' strengths, groom them and let them move up from blue-collar jobs to broad areas of responsibility.
He cited two examples: Mr Zulkifle Jamal, 46, went from being a dispatch driver for logistics company UPS, to leading a team of more than 100 people as its Air Hub operations manager.
Mr Zulkifle declines to give his current salary but says it is 15 times his starting pay 24 years' ago.
Mr Max Ang, 34, left school after his N-level examinations and took a job as a driver with marine company HSL. After a series of courses, he is now one of HSL's marine piling superintendents and earns $3,700 a month - three times his starting pay.
They are ordinary Singaporeans, said Mr Tharman, ""with an attitude"". He praised the work cultures that paved the way for them to move up, despite their lack of qualifications.
""It's individual effort and aspirations, but it's also a system, a management culture, that grooms everyone that has the potential, regardless of what they start with.""
This is important not just for the sake of an inclusive society, he said, but also to realise the Government's economic agenda of boosting productivity by training and upgrading every worker to contribute more.
Mr Tharman criticised systems in France and India, where there is a ""perfect meritocracy at age 22"", because the elite are determined in tests taken during young adulthood.
In India, civil servants in their 60s are still ranked according to their performance in the admissions examination for the administrative service, he said, adding: ""It's remarkable.""
Speaking to The Straits Times, both Mr Ang and Mr Zulkifle were adamant that despite slowing social mobility in Singapore, a lack of qualifications can still be overcome through hard work and by seizing opportunities.
For Mr Ang, whose father was a duck rice hawker, it boils down to ""whether you want to do it, or you don't want to"".
""If this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone,"" said Mr Zulkifle. ""The one thing you need is the willingness to tell yourself what you are going to be in the next 10 years... If you don't get demoralised, you can get there.""

","   A former chairman of the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP) yesterday critiqued the ""myth of meritocracy"" at the core of the Singapore system.
Mr Nizam Ismail, 45, also took issue with Minister of State Halimah Yacob's National Day Rally speech, saying it suggested that the reason the Malay-Muslim community has not succeeded ""as much as we can is because we did not work hard"".
Her statement took a ""very broad-brush approach"" that ignored real problems, he said, adding that meritocracy glosses over social inequality.
Mr Nizam was speaking at an AMP dialogue on the National Day Rally.
He pointed to ""stubborn gaps"" that the Malay-Muslim community faces in education and issues like juvenile delinquency and high divorce rates. Without addressing inequality, these gaps will widen, he said.
In his view, meritocracy also breeds elitism when those who succeed think they deserve it and look down on those who fail.
""I fear that perception is already ingrained in the minds of our policymakers,"" he said.
He suggested it was time to look at some forms of affirmative action.
Three other speakers spoke at the forum, including Economic Society vice-president Yeoh Lam Keong, who said the Malay-Muslim community's economic vulnerability at the bottom of the income ladder is its Achilles' heel. It threatens to undermine its main strength - strong social cohesion.
He called for the Government to move back to its old stance of ""thoughtful government intervention"" in public service areas where the market does not do a good job. He named six key social policy areas which need rethinking and restructuring: the social security system and safety net, public housing, education, health care, public infrastructure and transportation, and population and immigration policies.
Mr Yeoh said public housing used to be affordable, with flats priced at two to three times annual income. Now, as a result of public housing being pegged to market prices, it has become markedly more unaffordable and threatens to become even more so.
He referred to former senior parliamentary secretary Mohamad Maidin Packer's open letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Mr Maidin had touched on housing and immigration to warn of the eroding social compact and trust between Government and people.
Agreeing strongly, Mr Yeoh said if wide-ranging social reforms in these areas are not put in place, ""unfortunately, one of the most relatively negatively affected are likely to be members of the Malay-Muslim community"".
Dr Faizal Yahya of the Institute of Policy Studies warned that with many Malays working in the manufacturing sector, there will be implications as Singapore moves to a service and knowledge-based economy.
Also discussed yesterday was Our Singapore Conversation. Mr Nizam and lawyer and Aware activist Halijah Mohamad said the conversation should include alternative views and the voices of civil society.
Separately, the Singapore Democratic Party also held a forum yesterday to discuss issues faced by the Malay-Muslim community and the role it plays in Singapore's future.

She said that with meritocracy and focused efforts, she is confident that the Malay-Muslim community will climb higher up the ladder of success.
She pointed out that society must also help those who, due to personal circumstances or through no fault of their own, are unable to help themselves.

","   THE subject was unwed couples having children, and it drew conflicting views from Singaporeans at a studio discussion with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday.
A single mother wanted to have more children but did not want to get married. A father of three felt couples must marry before they have children. In a poll among the 50 studio guests, just over half thought unmarried couples should not have children.
But Mr Lee made it clear that he did not think society was ready for change on this issue.
He also discussed topics from pre-school education to attitude towards foreigners during the forum, billed as part of the National Conversation on Singapore's future. Participants ranged from university students and unionists, to managers and chief executives. Education Minister Heng Swee Keat and MPs Indranee Rajah and Intan Azura Mokhtar also took part.
Fashion designer Jo Soh, 36, who is single, said many of her friends felt they were being penalised for not marrying or starting a family. ""We have friends who are asking: 'If I can't find a husband that I want to marry, why can't I have a child as a single woman?... Why can't de facto couples have children and still have the same access to subsidies and rights?'""
Guest services manager Adora Doganis, a single mother with a daughter aged eight, said she was not keen to get married, but wanted more children. And she could not get a HDB flat.
""I can afford to raise more children. I've got a good job and good family support. I just don't have the facility,"" she said.
Mr Lee said the Government was looking into letting singles buy new HDB flats instead of only resale flats.
But senior manager Gopala Krishnan, who has three children, said he wanted them to marry and have children. ""I know it's difficult to find the right partner but maybe our bar is too high?""
The discussion prompted Mr Lee to ask for a poll on whether unmarried couples should have children. Of the 50 participants, 46 per cent said yes and 54 per cent said no. ""Quite close,"" said Mr Lee. ""It shows that attitudes gradually change and some people will be happy, some people will not be so comfortable, and we have to progress gradually and we have to be very careful of unintended consequences.""
He added: ""As a policy we should stick to encouraging traditional families. There will be some families who operate in different ways, we accept that. But as a norm, father, mother married and bringing up children has worked for us. We should be very careful not to shake the basis for that.""
He also spoke about the importance of Singaporeans having a shared purpose. While it used to be about moving out of poverty and having ""schools, houses and hospitals"", now it is about dreams and aspirations.
""You may want to teach. You may want to be in social enterprise. You may want to be in the arts or in music, or you feel passionately about building your business. I think the special thing about Singapore is that whichever aspirations you have, you have a chance of doing it here. Your child... ought to have more of a chance of doing it here.""
On his Facebook page last night, Mr Lee said: ""This is a good start to the national conversation.""
Ms Soh told The Straits Times later she felt the discussion went well: ""I opened a can of worms, but I was glad PM was open to it and put the issue to the poll.""
Primary school teacher Tay Xiong Sheng, 27, who is single, got a different takeaway.
He said he thought of marrying at age 40, when he was financially stable, but heard one participant say couples did not want children because ""they want everything to be perfect and achieve everything, which is not possible"".
He added: ""It made me think whether I should marry earlier.""

SENSE OF GRATITUDE
You're talking about meritocracy, I think that's important. We shouldn't give it up. But it must be complemented with a sense of sacrifice, community service, responsibility to the others who have helped you to succeed. Then Singapore will succeed.
- Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Singaporeans' values
BE PROUD, YET HUMBLE
We have to be decent human beings because, otherwise, it's not just foreigners who think the less of us. When we look in the mirror, we ask what sort of people are we? I think that's very bad. We have good reason to be proud of ourselves, but also be humble in the world. The world is a big place. Singapore is not doing badly, but there is a lot for us to learn. And if we have that attitude, then I think we can maintain a balance and we won't get big-headed, and that's most important.
- Mr Lee on values, and attitudes towards foreigners
PARENTS HAVE KEY ROLE
There was a long queue at the ladies' toilet and one lady brought a Primary 3 girl into the cubicle. The girl said: 'No, my teacher taught us we must queue up.' The mother said: 'No, you are urgent, just go in.' The girl said: 'No, no, no. Our teacher said we must queue up.' The mother said: 'You either do it or I'm going to slap you'.
- Education Minister Heng Swee Keat told this story, related to him by one mother, to illustrate the difficulty of teaching values, unless parents believe in them and are role models
KEEP ON MOVING
We never arrive, you see. Always on a journey. If you have arrived, you fall off the bicycle. We have to keep on moving and aiming for something which is in front of you, which is worthwhile.
- Mr Lee on getting together to define what Singapore needs to aim for in the next 20 to 30 years

"," Race relations; Politics; Web sites
","   Two decades ago when public figures lamented that nobody would want to enter politics because of the loss of privacy and the incessant attacks of critics, you sensed they were exaggerating. But nobody could have predicted how right they would be one day.
Back then, politicians could shroud themselves with an aura of dignity and power. The opportunities to show them up and take them down were limited. Today, on the Internet, politicians are routinely ridiculed - sometimes deservedly, but often for faults not of their own making, or for entirely fictitious, fabricated failures. In this climate, it takes extraordinary resolve or recklessness to run for public office.
Yet, that may not be the most daunting prospect for would-be national leaders. Even if politicians have the stomach for it - or if netizens miraculously become more polite - the question is whether it is possible to meet public expectations today. Those expectations have risen immeasurably.
Together with my colleagues Jeremy Au Yong and Aaron Low, I have been sifting through the questions readers want to pose to the Prime Minister. These have landed in the mailbox of this newspaper's new current affairs website singapolitics.sg
We wanted to find out the issues foremost on the minds of Singaporeans and to surface them to Mr Lee Hsien Loong. In the coming week, readers will vote on the questions they want the PM to answer.
Perhaps, we thought, the input from the ground could feed into the ongoing ""National Conversation"". That government-led exercise has its own website, oursgconversation.sg. There, you can get a flavour of the kinds of questions that the convenors hope Singaporeans will answer: What makes this place home or what kind of home do you want Singapore to be? How can we have more heart as a nation? What are your hopes for our shared future?
The questions received by our Singapolitics website provided a reality check. Most contributors were not really into the ""vision thing"". Their concerns were more immediate and more domestic.
Some wanted jobs for their children; others wanted flats for themselves at better locations; some wanted help for their small businesses. A number of middle-aged employees were anxious about competition from younger, cheaper workers. Many were upset about foreigners suppressing their wages and their status in Singapore.
In this regard, it seems things have not changed that much in Singapore. People's priorities are still the bread-and-butter issues. Give me a roof over my head; give me a good job; make my paper qualifications worth my investment of time and money; and so on. And, while you're at it, bring back that bus service and post office that you caused to disappear.
Far fewer were interested in engaging broader issues. One or two asked about growing income inequality. A handful wanted to know about race relations. A few asked about meritocracy. One was concerned about pollution.
I was taken aback at first. But then I realised it was to be expected. After all, politics everywhere is ultimately about how to resolve conflicts over society's scarce resources. Naturally, citizens would want politics to result in enough resources reaching them to assure a certain quality of life. And everyone is entitled to judge whether the country is being run to his satisfaction, applying any benchmarks he chooses - that is the whole point of the system of one person, one vote.
Commentators and political watchers may focus on the bigger picture, but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that citizens measure the state of the nation by how they are faring individually in terms of jobs, schools and other urgent and immediate concerns.
And despite Singapore becoming a developed country, the job of meeting people's expectations has become harder, not easier, for anyone in charge.
First, this is because people's demands are higher-end. For example, they no longer feel it is enough to get their children into a school - it has to be a good school.
And even if all schools are good by some objective criteria, parents fear their children will lose out in the rat race unless they are in a better-than-average school. And, of course, it is not possible for every school to be above average. Thus, in a highly competitive society, it is harder to give people the peace of mind that what they have is enough. Last week's announcement that the Education Ministry will abandon banding of schools is a symbolically important move, but on its own it won't address the root of the problem - parents' profound anxiety over whether their children's schools are equipping them to compete in life.
Second, Singapore has developed a petitioning culture, where many people judge their leaders by their ability to micromanage individual problems, rather than getting the overall system right. More than the citizens of most other countries, Singaporeans turn to the Government to solve their problems. Ironically, it is the People's Action Party Government itself that has created this mindset. In the past, a dependence on the Government was politically convenient at the polls, especially when it seemed to be getting most policies right - and you didn't have netizens highlighting every mistake.
Now, however, people's instinct to rely on the Government has become a political liability, since even the Government knows that it cannot solve all problems.
In a sense, the National Conversation is an attempt to address this dilemma by educating Singaporeans that governance involves trade-offs: no government can please all the people all the time, and long-term gain often requires short-term pain.
However, if Singapolitics' own little exercise is anything to go by, reframing the conversation won't be easy. You can create new spaces for consultation, but if most people want to use them to approach officials about their immediate problems, the nature of the interaction won't change. Instead of being like town hall meetings where people debate shared concerns with their elected leaders, you will get something like a Meet-the-People Session, with a long queue of petitioners seeking redress.
Leaders will need to feel their way forward in this new landscape. The promise of being able to deliver all of the citizens' wants no longer holds. What then is the new social compact? The Government will be on unfamiliar territory, needing to moderate expectations of its omnipotence. But some will refuse to believe that the Government can't help them; they will think it chooses not to. Others will delight in taking the PAP down a peg. In either case, it promises to be a rough road for those in public office.

27,"The Malay-Muslim community will do well without the burden of affirmative action.
",28,NA," Sep 16, 2012
"," Think
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Affirmative action
","   I read last Sunday's report (""Ex-AMP head critiques 'myth of meritocracy'"") and felt saddened by Mr Nizam Ismail's call for affirmative action.
The Malay-Muslim community in Singapore has risen in education, family togetherness, employability and quality of life over the years through consistent effort.
The community started on a lower base and battled many social problems. And it has progressed much on its own steam.
Mr Nizam's refusal to see the improvements made but to instead lean on phrases like ""stubborn gaps"" and ""social inequality among the races"" is puzzling.
His lack of confidence in the ability of his own community is a put-down for the growing number of Malay-Muslims doing well as students, undergraduates, skilled workers and professionals; and as parents raising healthy families. They have risen with fellow Singaporeans purely on merit.
Racial quotas will only lead to a loss of respect for the very people they seek to benefit. Would he want the doctors, firemen, soldiers, or teachers of any one ethnic group to be seen to be lesser than those from other groups?
Our self-help groups have backed national programmes with community support and cheered on the less well-off. By sharing responsibility and enhancing outreach to the vulnerable, these innovative arrangements have nurtured self-reliance and growing confidence within communities. They have helped prevent both dependency tendencies and socially divisive inter-group competition which are often the by-products of affirmative programmes.
Singaporeans should be given all the means of accessing resources. And efforts - big or small - must be respected for the human spirit behind them. But to insist that all efforts must bear the same outcomes sounds strange.
For Singapore, meritocracy with compassion is the best way to allow opportunities of equality to continue to transform us - regardless of race, language or religion - into a model progressive society that is just and united. Rather than quick fixes that lead to more fissures, let us build on our efforts, so that in time to come, we leave behind a community that our children and their children will be proud of.

","   The last couple of weeks have been especially interesting for word geeks like me.
For starters, the corruption trial of the former anti-narcotics chief Ng Boon Gay introduced me to the world of sexy texting, Singapore style. It has been fascinating.
On the one hand, sexting is what you would expect on our acronym-crazy island. ""DIY"", ""MU"" and ""SP"" are some examples that came up in court, in the SMS exchanges between Ng and IT sales executive Cecilia Sue.
What they tell me is that Singaporeans are now so busy, they have come up with ways to get more sexy chat done in less time. Now, that's efficiency.
One memorable SMS line, allegedly from Ms Sue to Ng, was: ""You ignore me."" Another: ""How? How? How?""
She is 36, he is 46. It dawned on me that while we oldies make fun of young people and their LOLs and BRBs, when it comes to flirty chats, everyone apparently regresses to their awkward teenage years.
If there is a dignified way to canoodle via texting, alas, we may not find it here in Singapore.
Another case which got the word nerd in me worked up is the one involving the Ferrari crash of May 12.
I learnt that when an insurance company has to step in to define a word in a policy, it may not turn out well for the insured.
AXA Insurance prefers to call the crash a ""collision"", and if it succeeds, a chunk of the policy taken out by the driver will be voided. Eh? I thought. Why the big deal about labels? I had to read a couple of stories from different newspapers several times to work out what was happening. I think I have come to an understanding.
Now, you and I (that is, normal people) think of two things hitting each other when we see the word ""collision"". The way a rock rolling down a hill might strike another rock, for example. It seems to me that lawyers for the insurance company are leaning on the word's silence when it comes to intention. ""Accidents"" are unintended. Collisions, from what I've read, are neither intentional nor unintentional.
And based on evidence that the crash was ""highly probable, foreseeable and to be expected"", according to the insurance company's lawyers, what happened that night was most definitely a collision.
And if an event is not an accident, ergo, that part of the policy that covers unintended events does not apply.
Lawyers from the family of the Ferrari driver who died, Mr Ma Chi, have not bought into that series of logical steps leading to the conclusion that it was a collision, not an accident. They are disputing the withdrawal of insurance coverage.
There are times when working out what people mean when they use certain words just leaves me grumpy.
Take the word ""meritocracy"", for example.
The problem is that lately, it has been talked up so much by groups with opposing agendas that the word has become like tofu. It has no flavour on its own. It absorbs whatever it is that the user surrounds it with.
You will see ""meritocracy"" used on the websites of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Manpower, cited as the reason for certain policies. Bloggers who dislike the policies will criticise the measures, using meritocracy as a tentpole argument.
Parse a sentence such as ""this scheme is good because it is meritocratic"" and it becomes apparent that it is just another way of saying that ""this scheme is good because it is fair"".
Using ""meritocratic"" instead of ""fair"" gives the statement the heft of explanation; no further justification is necessary.
Not so when you simply say ""this is fair"", because you might be asked to explain why fairer is better. Not everything that is fair is good, and vice versa. Some parents, for example, might think that the PSLE system is fair, yet terrible for overall child development.
Other than saying that Singapore in general is a meritocracy, using the word in other, smaller circumstances diminishes the word's importance.
For example, if you are in an organisation that wants to hire only Mandarin-speaking employees, it would not be technically correct to say that your company is merit-based, as not everyone in Singapore is given the same chance to study and use Mandarin.
I'd go so far as to say that meritocracy is a Singapore crutch word. Crutch words get me worked up. People lean on crutch words in their speech, such as ""what it boils down to"", ""essentially"" and ""at the end of the day"", to fill gaps. These are fillers, often used to hint that the speaker went to a good school.
When a person says ""because at the end of the day..."", I always think, ""There's a summary? Why didn't you give that to me instead of the long version?"" But I have also learnt, to my everlasting disappointment, that people who enjoy saying things such as ""at the end of the day"" are actually summary-impaired.
""Culture of excellence"" as the corporate slogan of the moment in particular makes me break out in a word nerd sweat, because it combines two good words, culture and excellence, into one blood-curdlingly vacuous phrase. It also carries the unfortunate implication that before its arrival, employees strived to fail. No one tries to fail. Failure is not the disease, it's one symptom of a bigger problem.
I am also feeling grumpy about small words too. For example, ""like"". Facebook limits users to either saying they ""like"" a post, or nothing at all. Why isn't there a ""dislike"" button?
We might want Singapore-specific buttons, such as ""Food pictures, again?"", ""Where did you buy that and how much did you pay?"", ""It's eerie how you can make the same face in every photo"" and ""Yes, we are all aware that you have a boyfriend"".
Facebook, with its ""like""-only rule, is the equivalent of that aunt who says ""If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything"", a rule which if applied in this country would render most of us silent.
The more we text and the more we post on Facebook, more of what we say is going to land in some database or end up available for all to see. That was the final lesson on words from the Ng Boon Gay trial.
So if you must text sexy, do it safely. Write as if one day, that line might be read out in public. Take some precautions. Spellcheck and watch your grammar.
You would not want to invite more ridicule. You'd be embarrassed enough as it is.

"," The Straits Times; Singapore
",NA,"   THE Government is doing both too much and too little, young Singaporeans at a forum told Senior Minister of State for Education and Information, Communications and the Arts Lawrence Wong last night.
The 60 young people aged 19 to 35 were also divided on whether Singapore's meritocratic system should concentrate more on providing equal opportunities or ensuring equal outcomes.
Their views came thick and fast at the forum organised by the four self-help groups and the Young Sikh Association, and supported by the National Youth Council (NYC).
Though it was not an official session under the Our Singapore Conversation umbrella, the participants saw the discussion as their ground-up contribution to the national conversation.
They spoke without reserve to Mr Wong, who will be the minister in charge of youth matters at the new Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth from next month.
One of them was Mr Faris Abdulkadir Basharahil, 25, who spoke for the Government-is-doing-too-much camp. The chief executive of an arts company noted that while the Government had increased funding for the arts this year, it directed all the funding to government agencies.
""Is the Government doing so much that it is actually competing with people on the ground and intermediaries?"" he asked.
On the other hand, public servant Arvinder Kaur, 22, called for more government intervention in areas such as social welfare. ""I'm more of the idea of how an individual can make change together with the Government,"" she said.
On meritocracy, some in the group called it an ""essentially heartless"" or ""utopian"" system in which ""those who start out behind fall even further behind"". But they were countered by others who felt meritocracy had served Singapore well.
Saying he agreed with all the views, Mr Wong responded: ""It's not so much that meritocracy is flawed, but it means having a broader sense of what merit is.""
The Government would continue to ensure the education system would be a social leveller, he said, including improving the pre-school system.
But mindsets would have to change so that Singaporeans embrace different forms of success beyond academic excellence and high pay.
As for how big a role the Government should have, Mr Wong was clear there are areas where too much government involvement could be counter-productive.
Recounting his visit earlier in the day to The Hub, a privately run incubator for social enterprises, he said: ""If NYC were to do that, it would not be so successful. But (it) very wisely decided, this is not something we can do.""
Instead, the youth council played a facilitative rather than direct role, and this was the role the Government should play.
Mr Wong's own priorities as the new Youth Minister, spelt out during his visit to The Hub, would be to support youth organisations and encourage more young people to volunteer.
Young people giving back to society and helping one another would be healthier than the Government trying to do everything, he said.""I do think our young people want to make a difference, and if we can unleash that energy and passion, I think they will be able to make a difference in our society.""

",NA,"   When Singaporeans sit down to talk about their vision of the country's future, many focus on values such as kindness, graciousness and compassion.
This theme has emerged in dialogues since the national conversation kicked off officially a week ago, observed Senior Minister of State for Education Lawrence Wong, a member of the panel overseeing the consultative process.
""There is something that people do feel in wanting a kinder society, a more gracious society. That is one emerging thread that I've seen in the conversations that I've attended so far,"" he told reporters after a session with 60 young people yesterday.
Organised by the National Youth Council, it saw youth aged 16 to 25 suggesting offbeat ideas to make Singapore a happier home, many of which centred on values.
Junior college student Ang Jie, 17, suggested having dedicated days to recognise the contributions of blue-collar workers such as cleaners and construction workers, to make Singaporeans more compassionate. ""This will help us better understand and appreciate what they do,"" she said.
Secondary 4 student Bryan Chua, 16, proposed a ""spontaneity fund"" to support activities that make people smile.
Others raised concerns over education issues, such as the subjects in school, exams and stress.
Concerns over values in society have featured prominently at recent dialogues where participants focused on issues like meritocracy and equality.
Yesterday, Mr Wong also attended the National Kindness Conference, where the big question was whether Singapore is a kind or unkind place.
Keynote speaker Professor Tommy Koh highlighted pluses and minuses in the way Singaporeans treat foreign workers, maids, the disabled, the elderly and pets, and participants suggested ways to make this a more gracious society.
Mr Wong noted that values had come up at both events.
While the youth session was not one of the 30 dialogues being held by the Our Singapore Conversation organisers, it was part of a series by the youth council as a ground-up initiative for the national conversation.
Some of the participants said they liked the informal setting which allowed them to fire questions freely at Mr Wong.
Sitting cross-legged on a thick futon, the incoming Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth gamely took all queries, including one from full-time national serviceman Tan Yi Hao, 19, who said what students study in school is often not useful in life.
The young man asked: ""When have you used (the mathematical formulae) integration and differentiation in your work?""
Mr Wong replied right away: ""Never."" He added later that he had to work with economic models in the earlier part of his career, but not now.
The NSF told The Sunday Times that the question had just popped into his mind. ""I would not have asked such a spontaneous question if it were a formal dialogue,"" he said.

AT TWO separate events last weekend, the topic of values was the key theme as participants focused on making Singapore a kinder, more gracious society.
At the National Kindness Conference, participants spoke about the need for more graciousness and compassion in the way Singaporeans treat foreign workers, maids and the disabled, as well as about cyber-bullying and people who do not return their trays at foodcourts.
Many noted that Singapore had become a lot less nice and kind.
Watching on was Senior Minister of State for Education Lawrence Wong, who also sits on a committee overseeing the national conversation.
After a youth dialogue the same day, he observed a common thread emerging from the forums he had attended: Singaporeans were showing a keen interest in the issue of values.
What's the buzz
MR WONG'S comments come after similar observations were made of the many dialogues held over the past weeks.
While many of these sessions were meant to focus on hard-nosed issues like population, participants were more keen to talk about values such as meritocracy, integration and egalitarianism.
This topic of values has gained traction, especially online.
This week, some sites were abuzz with discussions about how citizens have started clamouring for the Government to shift away from the headlong pursuit of economic growth and accept a slower pace. Some believe this would allow society to devote more attention to ""softer"" aspects like happiness, work-life balance and graciousness.
Why it matters
PROMOTING graciousness and kindness is not new: As far back as 1979, then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had launched the Courtesy campaign. His successor, Mr Goh Chok Tong, later pointed the way to a ""kinder, gentler society"".
But the overall thinking within the Government - that delivering high GDP numbers is the best way to keep citizens happy - largely remains.
And Singaporeans now appear to want that to change. How the Government adjusts to this new paradigm will have implications on policies ranging from the economy and infrastructure to population and education.
It also promises to fuel ongoing debate on what kind of economic growth Singapore should have, the optimal population size and mix, as well as hot issues like the influx of immigrants and fears of xenophobia.
What's next
IN THE national conversation that has just started, the man in charge, Education Minister Heng Swee Keat, has made clear that the dialogues will not be limited to specific topics.
The process will wrap up next year, and the committee, which includes members of the People's Action Party's (PAP) fourth-generation leadership, will then distil key themes and discuss them in greater detail.
Where the topic of values figures in this and how the Government eventually deals with the public's concerns will be closely watched.
It could determine the kind of society Singapore is looking to become and provide a glimpse into what the PAP's future stalwarts envision will be the country's policy as it enters the next lap.

","   The national conversation on Singapore's future will soon shift gears, with sessions that zoom in on broad themes taking place as early as next month.
The announcement - made yesterday by Senior Minister of State (for Education, and for Information, Communications and the Arts) Lawrence Wong - comes amid concerns that the discussions so far have lacked focus.
Speaking to reporters at a session at the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre yesterday, he said that the ideas raised so far will be grouped into themes for deeper conversations starting next month or in December.
""By organising them in a more thematic fashion, you can have richer and more focused discussions,"" he said.
He added that citizen dialogues have thus far been deliberately kept open-ended so as to solicit as many views as possible.
He stressed, however, that having themes was not about ""filtering out ideas"".
""It's really about moving from a very organic, open, sort of unstructured process, starting to cluster the ideas, starting to put them into broad themes and then going a little more in-depth into these themes,"" he said.
At the end of the session, Mr Wong identified education as one likely theme. The issue had dominated discussions among the 50 participants, who included students, businessmen and professionals.
Some felt the current system was too stressful, and that parents were still overly focused on grades.
One woman spoke about how her nephew, returning home after his mathematics exam, lamented that it was ""very easy... very easy to fail"". ""Do we need to make learning so difficult at such a young age?"" she asked.
Others felt that the education system added to the social divide and called for a greater mix of students from different streams.
To show the sort of social pressures children face, one group put up a skit involving two girls from different schools, with one boasting about her iPhone 5 and overseas holidays.
""We think it's worrying that it's starting at a younger age in society,"" said a group member.
Asked to give a newspaper headline describing the future Singapore, another group wrote: ""ITE grad helms Education Ministry."" They argued that people should not be boxed into stereotypes based on their educational level.
And just as in the session last week, yesterday's participants spent a lot of time talking about values and the Singapore soul.
Participants also brought up issues such as being an inclusive society and not focusing overly on economic development.
While wrapping up the 31/2-hour session, Mr Wong said he was very excited to see the energy in the group.
He also took the opportunity to address Singapore's focus on economic development in the past, saying that it arose from the circumstances at the time, one in which ""our parents and grandparents worked hard together and brought us to where we are today"".
Observing that some of the participants had talked about competition and meritocracy in ""not so positive terms"", he reminded them that these traits were the foundation of Singapore's success.
""Maybe we have gone overboard in some of these areas... So we need to recalibrate. We should certainly think through what are the fundamentals we should preserve.""
The session had its lighter moments as well. One group suggested that National Day be replaced by a Singapore Day that celebrates local culture, and Universal Studios opened up to everyone for free, so that people from all levels could mingle with one another.
For Madam Zunaidah Shahul Hamid, 48, who works in a charity, it was the discussion on education that hit home.
Said the mother of two girls, aged eight and 10: ""Our group had three mothers. We all spoke about values as a compass in a world that is uncertain.""

WP 'SHOULD RECONSIDER STANCE'
Senior Minister of State Lawrence Wong hopes the Workers' Party (WP) will reconsider its decision to have its leaders sit out the current phase of Our Singapore Conversation.
He said this yesterday when asked about a comment by WP chairman Sylvia Lim.
Ms Lim told The Straits Times on Thursday that the citizen dialogue sessions were ""better served without the presence of WP leaders, who would be assumed to represent the party even if invited as individuals"".
Said Mr Wong: ""She has stated her view, and I would just like to reiterate what I said earlier that what we are doing here is really having a conversation...
""No one has a monopoly of wisdom, everyone comes in as an individual, contributing his view and every view is important because every view matters... I would certainly encourage the Workers' Party to reconsider their position and consider whether they will participate in this process as well.""
Ms Lim was one of three opposition politicians who were invited to the first official session last weekend. WP's MP for Hougang Png Eng Huat and National Solidarity Party secretary-general Hazel Poa were invited too. None attended, but Ms Poa intends to go next month.

","   MERITOCRACY has been a key value that helped Singapore transform from a Third World to a First World nation.
Meritocracy has many good results but also some negative ones. It is important at this juncture in Singapore's history to consider and ameliorate the pernicious effects of meritocracy.
Meritocracy, entrenched by early Singapore leaders, has ensured that Singaporeans with competent abilities have governed the country since independence. A meritocratic system prevents the most debilitating excess - the transfer of positions of power to one's kin regardless of capabilities, which would cause most government and enterprises to lose their effectiveness.
The current governance system is sustained by our merit- based public education and competitive scholarship system. The majority of today's Cabinet are former public scholarship holders.
But meritocracy has its ugly sides too. With better education and earning power, many winners of today's meritocratic system use their resources to ensure that their children remain winners. The tuition industry and alumni preferences for admission to popular primary schools propel forward those who have much in our merit-based education system, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots.
The outcome - a more unequal society, with slowing social mobility. Already, six out of 10 students from the six most popular primary schools live in private property, disproportionately high when you consider that across the country, only two out of 10 students live in private housing.
Singapore lacks definitive comprehensive studies on inter-generational social mobility. In the absence of these, anecdotal evidence and public perception have become a substitute for data. Many Singaporeans wonder if those who start at a lower station in life today are more likely to stay there, compared to 20 to 30 years ago, when many believed a rising tide lifted all boats.
Apart from inequality, another ugly aspect of meritocracy is the rise in social distance between the winners of the system and the rest. The term ""social distance"" - expounded by Christopher Hayes in Twilight of the Elites - refers to a widening gulf as winners enjoy different daily living experiences and social norms.
In the past five years, many Singaporeans have experienced the frustration of overcrowding on buses and Mass Rapid Transit trains during peak hours, of being unable to communicate with foreign workers serving or cleaning at coffee shops and hawker centres, and have had to put up with long waiting times at the polyclinics. Young couples despair as prices of Housing Board flats on the resale market soar on the back of rising demand, in part from foreigners.
Singapore's decision-makers meanwhile are top earners in the public and private sectors, with incomes multiple times that of an ordinary worker. Their lifestyles may not involve jostling with crowds on the bus or MRT, waiting at polyclinics, or living in an HDB flat.
To be sure, Singapore's meritocratic system has benefited the country and citizens. But we must also acknowledge the consequences of the ugly sides of meritocracy.
Singapore's meritocratic system worked well when we started from a lower and more equal base years ago. Today, income inequality is high. Social mobility is believed to be declining. There is a need to be conscious of how Singapore has changed, as we adjust policies.
Policymakers must continue to proactively step up their efforts to solicit inputs of ordinary Singaporeans on policies. Latent elite bias must be consciously guarded against - senior policymakers must not look at how policies contemplated would affect their peers or people like their family members or friends. Instead, they must consciously don the lens of the ordinary Singaporean worker earning a $3,249 monthly wage, which was the median last year. Half of all Singaporean workers earn below that amount, and 100,000 Singaporean workers who work full time earned less than $1,000 a month as of June last year.
Next, we must affirm the importance of social mobility, giving it the same arduous attention as our system of meritocracy. We must ensure that social mobility does not decelerate despite greater resources available to the winners. Otherwise, a self-perpetuating group of winners may withdraw support from institutions that promote meritocracy.
If that sounds far-fetched, consider the negative response to suggestions to review primary school admission. Reducing the quota for alumni or for those who live nearby will likely help enhance diversity and allow a wider cross-section of students to study at those schools, especially as many are situated among private housing estates.
The suggestion to use criteria beyond Primary School Leaving Examination scores to allocate places to secondary schools may also draw opposition from well-to-do parents who have significantly more resources to help their children excel academically.
In this way, a merit-based system, which allows parents to confer their advantages to their children, becomes a means to lock out those who have not accrued those advantages.
At the individual level, winners in our meritocratic system must be aware that their achievements are enabled by the society they live in. Investment guru Warren Buffett has said he was lucky to be born in the United States where his skills in allocating capital are well-rewarded. He wryly shared that he could easily have been some animal's lunch if he was born a few thousand years ago because he cannot run fast or climb trees.
Winners of our meritocratic system who feel they deserve their success because they worked hard - and the rest deserved their places in society because they didn't - should ask themselves if their success might be due to their different starting points in life in an increasingly unequal Singapore.
As a society, we need to be conscious of the ugly side of meritocracy, and work assiduously to promote social mobility, rather than accept that rising inequality is an inevitable consequence of meritocracy.

",NA,"   THE People's Action Party (PAP) has been holding discussions on Singapore's future as part of a larger effort to engage party members, activists and their friends at ground level.
Over the past two months, it has been organising dialogues at branch and district levels, where people have talked about hot-button issues such as meritocracy and foreign talent.
The discussions culminate in a party seminar that is being held tomorrow, when district representatives will present their findings on the different themes.
About 500 people are expected at the event. They include Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who will give his views as the party's secretary-general.
The biennial party conference will take place a week later, on Dec 2.
The aim of these ground-level discussions is to build a deeper understanding of the challenges facing the country, said Acting Minister for Social and Family Development Chan Chun Sing, a member of the PAP's central executive committee.
""We talk a lot about engagement but everything must start inward. Our own people must be energised,"" he told reporters at a recent briefing on the coming PAP seminar.
The discussions were organised first at the PAP's 87 branches before moving up to its five districts and involved more than 800 people in all.
The sessions centred on five broad themes:Moving fast - staying firm;Fulfilling individual aspirations - achieving societal goals;Giving our best - sharing our nest;Globally competitive - locally connected;Inclusive politics - decisive government.
Participants sought to find balancing points between these contrasting positions.
The discussions saw diverse views surfacing on some topics, Mr Chan recalled, such as dual citizenship and whether a move towards being inclusive of diverse views has come at the expense of not being decisive. The discussions, said the minister, showed that the PAP is ""not so monolithic"" and is a ""broad church"".
Assistant manager Benjamin Chua, the vice-chairman of the Yew Tee branch, was one of those who took part in a discussion on whether Singapore should allow dual citizenship.
The 24-year-old, who is against the idea, noted that others felt it should be considered as more Singaporeans are living overseas, where they can have a greater exchange of knowledge.
""The main point of contention was the trade-off: whether they will lose their rootedness to Singapore,"" he recalled.
Mr Chan said ideas from the PAP's discussions could be channelled to the ongoing national conversation on Singapore's future.

","   Even as the ruling party is leading a national conversation, the PAP cannot relegate itself to just being a ""note taker"" of views.
It must continue to be able to lead with its own ideas and policies, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday, as he put in context what the ongoing large-scale consultation means to the party.
""We are not just asking people, what are your views, and I will go and I will be your note taker and speak on your behalf.
""I think we have ideals, we have ideas, we have policies, we have proposals. And it is our responsibility to lead that discussion together with the people in order to persuade people to see things more in the way we do,"" he said.
He was addressing some 500 People's Action Party activists at the PAP Party Seminar, at the end of what was the party's own version of the national conversation exercise.
Party district representatives gave closed-door presentations at the seminar, held at Lasalle College of the Arts, that captured over two months of dialogues at the PAP's 87 branches and five districts, where issues from meritocracy to politics and foreign workers had been discussed.
PM Lee, who is the secretary- general of the party's central executive committee, stressed as well that a ruling party cannot afford to behave like an ordinary political party. For the PAP, slogans cannot just sound good; they have to be delivered on, he said.
""We are very careful of what we say, and we are very conscientious to make sure it can happen. So we have to think hard. And the party has to think hard of what is its role in the future for the next 20 to 30 years,"" said PM Lee.
In a speech that also laid out some of the key challenges for the party and the country, he said that what has allowed for a dominant party and cohesive politics in Singapore is a middle ground. Across the constituencies, there are Singaporeans who share similar interests and an identity.
This, he said, is unlike the United States, which is divided by interests into red and blue states which support the Republican and Democrat parties, respectively.
""If Singapore had the blue constituencies and red constituencies, I think Singapore will be in trouble,"" said Mr Lee.
He also reiterated the difficulties Singapore faces in balancing the trade-offs in all the choices it makes and that it is important to change policies because ""yesterday's solution can be today's problem"".
On the foreign worker tightening, which has raised the ire of many firms, he said: ""Let's proceed, but be prepared to rethink and recalibrate when the situation changes.""
There is balance needed in the type of politics too, he added, between an inclusive politics and a decisive government that goes ahead with decisions even when some people do not like it.
""It's not just whether we dare to go or we don't dare. It's whether the population accepts that this Government is doing it, and you may not agree, but you believe it is doing it for the good of Singapore and good of Singaporeans,"" he said.
And while it may not be ""politically fashionable"" for a government to say, ""I believe in this, follow me"", a government that just agrees with what the people want would make for failed leaders, said PM Lee.
""I think we need to reflect people's aspirations and dreams, but if we are just hao hao xian sheng - whatever people say, you agree - I think we would be failed leaders.""
But being decisive needs to be balanced by the need to win elections. If the PAP cannot win elections, he said, there is a risk that ""politics would malfunction because it is not going to be easy to put together another group to make Singapore work"".
He pointed to Japan, which has had three prime ministers in three years, and said that it is because there has been a loss of confidence in the system.
""In Singapore, we must never let that happen. That means the PAP must stay strong, must stay vibrant with members who believe in their cause, who are prepared to serve and who will fight to win.""

","   At yesterday's PAP conference, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke of the need for a new balance in three key areas: economic growth, national identity and meritocracy. Rachel Chang reports.
Going for growth and liveability
THE economy is expected to grow by 1.5 per cent this year, and already there are ""long faces"".
Workers worry about smaller bonuses and increments. Businesses will create fewer jobs.
A long stretch of such slow growth or no growth would hit low-wage workers the hardest, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and they would find it even tougher to move up.
Young people looking for ""opportunities, adventure and challenge"" will head elsewhere, and ""we will become an old folks' home in Singapore"".
Mr Lee issued this warning after calls from some Singaporeans for the country to slow down.
They fail to realise that growth is necessary to improve lives and build a liveable city, he said.
""I think the people who say, don't worry about growth, or that we have our spectacles facing the wrong direction, I think they don't appreciate this point. We have to calibrate but we have to find the right balance.""
The goal should be an optimum level of growth that provides the country with the resources it needs, yet gives Singaporeans time for family and friends, PM Lee said.
The Government is not aiming for ""ridiculous, high-speed"" growth, he said.
A good pace of growth would be between 3 and 4 per cent. And as the workforce grows more slowly in the future, even growth of 2 to 3 per cent would be ""considered good growth"", he added.
Why S'pore must remain open
AN IBM dictaphone, a Kodak camera and a clunky MP3 player - these were some of the items that have been sealed in the Science Centre's time capsule, first buried in 1973 and opened for the third time last week.
How ""quaint and cute"" they now seem is a reminder of how quickly the world moves, and why Singapore must remain open to it, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday.
The rapid influx of foreign workers has made Singaporeans feel like their national identity is being diluted, he acknowledged.
But the answer is not to seal off the country like a time capsule; instead, the right balance must be found between a strong citizen core and an openness to the world.
""We cannot close up quickly, or else we will die,"" he said, warning against a Singapore that resists change, freezes as it is today and ends up a museum.
""We cannot just open up, or else we will be swamped,"" he added. ""Diluted, dissolved, disappear.""
There are programmes in place to strengthen the Singapore identity and the emotional ties that anchor citizens to this place.
Schools are renewing their focus on values, character and citizenship education.
Arts and cultural events and heritage trails highlight what is distinctive about Singapore.
National Service builds bonds, as do efforts to nurture communities in every town, and the ongoing national conversation.
Finally, going through tough times together, such as the Sars crisis and the global financial crisis, also strengthens people's sense of a Singaporean identity, the Prime Minister said.
'If not meritocracy, then what?'
THE Prime Minister agrees that meritocracy should not be about judging people by their academic grades alone, or letting the Primary School Leaving Examination decide a child's future.
But Mr Lee Hsien Loong also worries when Singaporeans charge that meritocracy is wrong, because ""if we are not going on merit, how are we going to do it?""
Would Singapore then move to a system based on wealth, or connections or race, he asked. ""Is that the Singapore we have fought to build?"" he asked impassionedly.
If merit were not the governing principle, then a child from a poor family would not be recognised for what he was good at or invested in, he warned.
It was for this very principle of equal opportunity and meritocracy that Singapore left Malaysia, he said, referring to the founding generation of PAP leaders' campaign for a ""Malaysian Malaysia"" in the 1960s.
What Singapore needs is to calibrate its meritocracy so that society defines success and merit widely, and celebrates a whole range of talents, including the overcoming of adversity.
It also cannot be a system built on the idea of ""every man for himself"".
Mr Lee pledged that the Government would do all it can to boost those from disadvantaged backgrounds and help them achieve their potential.
It will keep open paths to success for different types of talent. And it will care for all Singaporeans, through schemes such as Workfare and ComCare.
He also urged the successful to contribute back to society, ""so that more can succeed like you, so that people will see that the system is fair and support the system"".

",NA,"   WHILE meritocracy as a fundamental value of society is a given, the way it is set up in Singapore deserves examination (""'If not meritocracy, then what?'""; Monday).
Meritocracy's underbelly reveals an elite group that has been bred in Singapore, where teenagers, at the age of 18, are given prestigious scholarships on account of their academic performance and extra-curricular experience.
Such a system has repercussions on the spirit of learning and personal growth for the next generation.
It is not uncommon for brighter students to attempt to shape their entire education towards obtaining that prestigious scholarship.
Netting such a scholarship will eventually place them in important positions in the public sector, where they are given more opportunities to shine and where their ""career end points"" are immediately deemed further and higher than those who enter government service without scholarships.
This elite scholarship system creates a socio-educational climate where the young are not given enough time to reflect on what interests them most in life.
It also disadvantages, if ever so implicitly and subconsciously, non-scholarship holders who serve with passion and intelligence.
A meritocracy that, on the one hand, aims to promote people on account of their performance will be perverted if, on the other hand, it is predisposed to advance people largely because they were scholarship holders.
This is because there is no necessary connection between performing at work and being awarded a scholarship.
Indeed, anointing 18-year-olds as having the right aptitude and attitude for particular kinds of work, even before they have gone through life as such or the baptism of tertiary education, is not true meritocracy. It is manufactured meritocracy.

","   UNLIKE Mr Harvey Neo (""Repercussions of meritocracy: Prized scholarships bear examination""; Wednesday),
I believe that the Singapore scholarship system is necessary to maintain the public sector's human resource pre-eminence.
Mr Neo argues that students structure their education to win scholarships. Yet, there are a variety of scholarships that cater to different industries and students.
Every ministry requires scholarship holders who are a good fit with its goals, and there is no quasi-mandatory activity that one must complete to win a scholarship.
Furthermore, there is only a handful of students from each cohort, who have achieved much in school, vying for scholarships.
For them, winning a scholarship offers a head start in a chosen profession and industry.
Second, Mr Neo states that scholarship holders are automatically fast-tracked within the organisation at the expense of non-scholarship holders.
Scholarship holders are held to a higher standard than their peers and must prove worthy of remaining in the organisation for the long term and of their progression. A scholarship merely provides the chance to attract and nurture talent.
Non-scholarship holders can also prove themselves, as the scholarship route does not impede the rise of other talented people within an organisation.
Not all senior management within the civil service are scholarship holders.
Finally, Mr Neo notes that 18-year-olds are not given enough time to reflect on what interests them most in life before agreeing to a scholarship.
Yet, junior colleges and polytechnics offer internships, job attachments and career counselling, which help students make informed decisions.
While there is no correlation between academic achievement and workplace excellence, scoring well in school and doing well at work are not mutually exclusive.
Undecided students can apply for mid-term or graduate scholarships.
Scholarship holders are sought after and many have proven that they have a higher chance at succeeding in whichever industry they eventually land in.
Even without a scholarship, they are likely to work in professions that reward their talent.
The civil service needs such individuals to craft policies that will continue to drive the success of the Singapore story.

It has been a longstanding practice that those who perform exceptionally well in the GCE A levels are given scholarships to enable them to fulfil their academic potential.
It is true that many move on to establish good careers, and there is no doubt that they have earned it through sheer hard work.
Those who are not picked for scholarships after their A levels should not despair because there are scholarships at polytechnics too. Even those who miss out on both can get workplace scholarships if they qualify.
The Ministry of Education and health institutions are among organisations that give out scholarships to deserving students and staff.
In addition, for those who cannot get a scholarship here and feel they deserve one, there are overseas scholarships offered by universities and other institutions.
Meritocracy has been a cornerstone of Singapore's success story.
No student qualifies to study in a tertiary institution without merit; and without merit, a student cannot obtain a scholarship.

","   IT IS a mistake to begrudge someone's wealth relative to one's own (""Minding the wealth gap""; Dec 4). Wealth is merely the accumulated savings of earned income.
We should use wealth in the right way, like Singapore's foreign reserves, which protect our strong currency and enhance social welfare for everyone.
Private wealth, too, can do much social good if it is invested back into physical and human capital for the economy, instead of being squirrelled away.
About 35 per cent of Singapore's economy is funded by foreign investments.
Singapore can gain from this by way of taxes and better wages for citizens.
Domestically, we must accept a scale of income distribution that starts with a living wage at the bottom, so that the benefits of growth are spread more widely.
This is good for business as domestic consumption is strengthened when households have more income to spend.
Lower-income households will be able to save more too.
By deconstructing the underclass in our economy, all stakeholders will need to adjust and move towards a fair price for labour, which completes the virtuous cycle between personal interest and sustainable economic growth for the country.
A functioning society needs this social compact.
We must realise that useful contributions can be made by people with different skills, knowledge and applications - that is the premise of meritocracy.
With common comity, we can be assured that all jobs that need to be done will attract people motivated to do them well.

"," Society
","   TROUBLED by recent criticism of the principle of meritocracy, many - including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong - have asked what a viable alternative to it could be. It is a question of considerable importance. After all, Singapore's concept of a multiracial meritocracy goes to the heart of its existence as a sovereign nation. Any alternative to meritocracy - wealth, connections or race - would not only dilute the rationale of independence but also degrade the public sphere insidiously over time. Debate over the functioning of meritocracy is useful, but can society ever be too meritocratic or Singapore too multiracial?
The case for meritocracy rests on the premise that it is the fairest and most efficient way of allocating rewards. It holds open the door to success for talented children from disadvantaged backgrounds irrespective of their race and religion. This way, it resists the emergence of narrow economic and ethnic elites who are concerned with entrenching their power and are unresponsive to the needs of society as a whole. By rejuvenating the system from generation to generation through relentless competition, meritocracy prevents leadership - be it in business, the professions or the civil service - from ossifying.
While the principle of meritocracy is a sound one, its implementation cannot be static. Today, the challenge is not to shrink the meritocratic base but to broaden it by going beyond academic achievement as the primary measure of talent. More effort might also be needed to ensure that the benefits gained by one generation do not accrue disproportionately to their offspring, thereby stultifying the progress of others born to less privileged parents. That way lies a class-ridden society, with all its bitter divisions.
Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam has spoken of the need for a continuous meritocracy in which people are evaluated throughout their lives and not on the basis of academic performance at a young age. Career advancement, too, should not depend on where someone left the education system. How exactly such ideas can be implemented remains to be seen, but they should spark new thinking about the relationship between meritocracy and social mobility.
What would be unacceptable would be to reject meritocracy, especially on ethnic grounds. Issues of educational under-performance and economic under-achievement are matters of national concern; their resolution, too, can only be national. Affirmative action policies tailored to a particular community might give it a leg-up temporarily, but it won't be long before reality bites. A meritocratic state is no utopia.

","   What it's all about
Students in Singapore are on top of the world in mathematics, science and reading, according to two international studies released this week.
Primary 4 pupils are world beaters in maths and second in science, in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (Timss). Secondary 2 students fared no worse, coming in second in mathematics but first in science.
With reading, the Primary 4 pupils are placed fourth in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study.
In itself, this good showing is hardly eye-popping. Singapore has been in the top three in the Timss since 1995, with just one exception: Primary 4 pupils were seventh in science that year.
But there is one noteworthy highlight in the latest tests: Singapore's weaker students also scored better.
These results are not due to feverish cramming. The tests show the students' reasoning skills have improved from previous rounds, although some scored less well on questions that tested just their knowledge.
What's the buzz?
The news raised few eyebrows, but drew some cheers. On KiasuParents online forum, several said they were proud of Singapore's children as well as its education system.
Even as the Government looks beyond academic excellence, that excellence must remain ""a foundation stone supporting the altar of meritocracy"", noted site administrator ChiefKiasu. But on other forums and on Facebook, some dismissed the studies as merely assessing ""book smarts"".
Why it matters
For the Ministry of Education (MOE), the students' sharper reasoning skills show that its move towards developing a questioning mind has paid off.
Syllabuses were trimmed in the late 1990s, and again after the ""Teach Less, Learn More"" approach in 2004.
With less to teach, teachers were supposed to have more room for innovation and more time for activities to spark creativity and critical thinking.
Today, for instance, science lessons feature ""hands-on inquiry-based investigations (which) help students ask questions, reason scientifically and communicate their thinking"", the MOE said when commenting on the studies.
What's next?
The focus on reasoning skills is here to stay. But it is accompanied by a growing emphasis on values, to form a ""holistic education"".
The MOE is strengthening Character and Citizenship Education, with a new unit set up for it in December last year.
But while doing so, Singapore has no intention of losing its current academic rigour, said director-general of education Ho Peng this week. The caveat should reassure the ""kiasu parents"" out there.

","   LAST week, the agency in charge of getting singles to date and marry sparked off a storm of protests when it launched ""love vouchers"".
Some singles took offence at the thought that their family and friends would see it fit to buy them a chance at love - rather than trust them to win mates based on their personal qualities and merit.
Money muddies the waters when it comes to relationships.
But subsidising the cost of dates pales in comparison to using money to buy one's child a coveted job, promotion or place in a top school.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong defended Singapore's meritocracy on that basis two weeks ago, in a speech to the People's Action Party (PAP) conference.
He said that he worries when people charge that Singapore's long-established way of distributing rewards based on merit is wrong because ""if we are not going on merit, how are we going to do it?""
Would Singapore then move to a system based on wealth or connections or race, he asked.
The answer, of course, is ""no"". Singapore's meritocracy is not under that kind of challenge.
What is being questioned is whether the system as it works today remains truly about merit and merit alone. Or is it the case that the rich can now use their wealth to buy their way to merit, and use their connections to make up for a lack of merit?
Such concerns lie behind questions like the one posed by PAP MP for Marine Parade GRC Seah Kian Peng last month.
In a written question in Parliament, Mr Seah asked the Education Minister about the housing types of pupils in six top primary schools: Raffles Girls', Methodist Girls', Henry Park, Anglo-Chinese School (Primary), Nanyang and Tao Nan.
In his reply, Mr Heng Swee Keat revealed that only four in 10 pupils from these schools live in Housing Board flats. That is half the national average of eight in 10 pupils for all primary schools.
Mr Heng said the 40 per cent figure ""broadly reflects the mix of residential housing in the vicinity of these schools"".
Tao Nan is in Marine Parade, ACS (Primary) in Newton and the remaining four in Bukit Timah.
Since children who live within a 1km radius of primary schools enjoy priority for places in them, parents with the means to buy homes in these areas will surely do so, to give their children a headstart in life.
Days after PM Lee's speech, Mr Kevin Lee wrote to The Straits Times Forum page to call for an end to practices that he said ""fly in the face of meritocracy"".
The three he cited were priority in Primary 1 registration for children of alumni, lower secondary school entry requirements for pupils from affiliated primary schools and a lower secondary school entry requirement for those in the Gifted Education Programme.
That is not all. In Singapore's market-based system, money also buys children higher-quality pre- school education, tuition and enrichment classes.
All these serve to enhance and boost whatever natural talents or merit children possess, and to perpetuate advantages from one generation to the next.
At the same time, no one can fault rich parents for using the resources at their disposal to help their offspring stay ahead of the pack.
The danger, of course, is that over time, inequality begets greater inequality. The cycle of advantage becomes structural, as does the cycle of disadvantage.
Those who criticise such structures are not attacking meritocracy, they are critiquing the status quo.
They are warning that if left unchecked, certain aspects of Singapore-style competition will lead to an ever more stratified society, which those stuck at the bottom will come to decry as unfair.
But change will not be easy. For starters, the winners of the current system will resist it, and they are armed with wealth and influence.
For another, any change to tilt the balance in favour of weaker and less-advantaged groups risks being seen as anti-competitive, and therefore anti-meritocratic as well.
That is clear from some responses to proposals to review the way secondary school places are allocated, for example.
One suggestion is to lower the entry scores for top secondary schools. That would allow a more diverse group of students to qualify for places, including less-advantaged children who lack the head start that their more privileged peers enjoy.
In a strongly worded letter to the ST Forum, Mr Ang Peng Seong expressed his objection.
He wrote: ""To enable children to get into their desired schools through a relaxation of the criteria is a travesty of meritocracy, akin to telling Cambridge and Harvard not to offer places to the brightest, and multinational corporations not to select the best.""
Those who share Mr Ang's concern say such changes will only lead to a ""mediocracy"" - where mediocrity rather than excellence is celebrated.
That is a valid concern.
But for a meritocracy to be sustainable, it cannot privilege excellence and competition over all other social goods, including diversity and equality.
For schools to have a diverse student body is a strength. It gives young people a chance to meet, get to know and hopefully empathise with peers whose backgrounds differ from theirs. It helps to reduce the social distance between the haves and have-nots.
For a society to be perceived as just and fair, those who start out behind must believe they have a shot at success.
Money and connections boost the opportunities of the privileged. Where possible, the Government should step in to equalise opportunities for the rest.
With lower entry scores, a bigger pool of students has a chance to gain entry into a top school.
These measures are not anti- meritocratic. They keep a meritocracy balanced and sustainable, by ensuring its rewards are spread widely across society.

","   Meritocracy in Singapore is about more than just academic grades, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday as he stressed that everyone here - regardless of background - has a shot at success.
""When we say 'merit', we are not just talking about grades or scores, but also character, leadership and a broad range of talents,"" said PM Lee said in a speech to more than 1,500 students and their parents at a bursary and Edusave award ceremony in his Teck Ghee ward.
He said: ""We make sure that whatever your family background, whatever your circumstances, you may be poor, you may be from a single-parent family, you may be having some learning disabilities, but if you work hard, you can succeed.
""It does not matter what your background is. We make sure we identify you, we give you the opportunities and also the resources and the support so that if you succeed, you can do well for Singapore.""
Yesterday was the second time in just over a month that PM Lee stressed that meritocracy cannot be narrowly defined as being just about grades. He also spoke on the topic at a PAP conference on Dec 2 last year.
In that speech, the Prime Minister said he was worried when Singaporeans reject meritocracy and asked what could replace merit as the basis for decisions on jobs or school places.
The principle has come under considerable scrutiny in recent months, especially in the field of education. Some have asked, for instance, if the scholarship system causes elitism.
While the Prime Minister repeated the same call on broadening the definition of meritocracy, yesterday he focused on what roles parents and students can play in it.
He urged parents to set an example: ""Guide your children, set good examples and instil good moral values in them.""
Turning to students, Mr Lee urged them not to neglect their studies even though there would be more focus on character, leadership and service.
""Results and grades are not the only measure of success or the only thing that matters in life,"" Mr Lee said, adding: ""But it is important that you learn and study hard to give you a good basis for what you can do in life.""
He pledged that the Government will continue to help all students achieve their potential.
In a Facebook posting last night, the Prime Minister praised four students who received Edusave awards for excelling in areas beyond their school books.
Among them is Primary 5 pupil Xavier Bok, who received an Edusave Character Award for participating actively in his school's adventure camp despite his night blindness. He is also a class leader who tutors other pupils who are weak in Chinese, said Mr Lee.
The Edusave Character Award was introduced last year for students who show good character and exemplary values. It included a cash award of up to $500.
""The Edusave awards reflect the Government's commitment to meritocracy, and to help every student achieve their best,"" said Mr Lee. ""To the students, congratulations and keep on trying to do better!""

","   THE nomination of Madam Halimah Yacob as Speaker of Parliament is one that many Singaporeans have applauded. She transcends divides with her outstanding record of public service, dignity and down-to-earth approach. This was reflected in her statement that she plans to continue living in her Yishun HDB flat notwithstanding the high office she is to take up.
The Minister of State for Social and Family Development is respected widely in Singapore for her personal integrity and her devoted work for various social constituencies since her entry to Parliament in 2001.
These segments include labour, families, women, the needy, the elderly, and the Malay-Muslim community. Her departure from the front bench would represent a loss for all these constituencies, which together account for much of Singapore society.
Since the function of the Speaker is not so much to speak as to listen, Singaporeans will lose an ardent advocate of the interests of some of the most vulnerable among them. Her ability to combine genuine compassion with a level-headed awareness of constraining realities is the key to her success as a politician.
Kind-hearted but tough-minded, she has presented arguments on major issues of the day, respecting the frontiers of the possible while exploring how far they can be pushed.
What Singaporeans will miss when she relinquishes her role as office-bearer will be compensated for by her reassuring presence in guiding and shaping parliamentary debates on the basis of the political clarity which she exemplifies. The election of the first woman to the Speaker's post would certainly be proof that gender is no bar to occupying the highest political offices in Singapore. It would also underscore once again the practice of meritocracy here.
Madam Halimah's candidature is commendable, not because she is a woman, or a Malay, but because she is a person eminently qualified for the job who happens to be a woman, and from a minority community. The distinction is important as she would represent the interests and aspirations of Singaporeans as a whole.
Indeed, by most accounts, her gender and race have been non-issues for most people. Undoubtedly, she has been one of the most important voices of the Malay-Muslim community. However, her approach to ethnic issues of educational and economic performance has always highlighted the need to adopt a national perspective in weighing options.
Her ability to articulate the overlapping interests of the constituencies she has served is the reason all communities accept and welcome the nomination of Madam Halimah as Speaker.

","   AT LUNCH time yesterday, I drove as fast as I could to Punggol East, cursing every red light in the Sengkang Housing Board estate that slowed me down.
Although I'm a political journalist, it wasn't the impending by-election that brought me there post-haste. It was my niece's O-level results. Her school is smack in the middle of the ward which goes to the polls on Jan 26.
The coincidence meant I could take some hours to give her moral support - and thank the school - in good conscience on a work day. I told myself I would drive around the constituency after I was done.
In the end, there was no time.
And frankly, no mood to do so.
Emotions run high when 16-year-old girls await their results. Tears and hugs were common. When I arrived, parents were earnestly discussing with their children the merits of junior colleges or polytechnics, or waylaying teachers for advice.
Across Singapore, 37,259 candidates who sat last year's O levels got their results yesterday. Of these, 81.3 per cent scored five or more O-level passes. Fortunately, my niece was among them.
A few hours after we left the area, when evening broke, election candidates would be out pounding the streets or giving out fliers.
With the People's Action Party having introduced its candidate, Dr Koh Poh Koon, 40, attention has swerved to the opposition: Will the other parties give way to the Workers' Party (WP) which got a creditable 41 per cent there in 2011 or will there be a multi- cornered fight? And will the WP field past candidate Lee Li Lian, or choose another candidate deemed more likely to wrest a few hundred more votes from the PAP?
In the morning, I was seized with the political drama unfolding in the opposition camp when I was with colleagues.
But when I was with my niece, all interest in politics evaporated.
Instead, I was focused on one thing: her results, her options, her future. Her life.
And that is as it should be.
After all, politics is a means to an end. Yes, the political process matters a great deal, especially in a country like Singapore which has long had a single party in near-total control, despite having democratic elections. Voters are these days seized by politics and politicking as never before since Independence.
But in the end, politics matters not for itself, but because it is our way of choosing the leaders and the party who will shape policies that impact each of our lives. Which party's values and ideals do you subscribe to? Which set of people do you think will give your children a better future?
The answer to such questions would once have been obvious: the PAP.
After all, this is the party that has brought Singapore from Third World to First.
Dr Koh is an embodiment of this. The eldest son of a pig farmer turned bus driver, he did odd jobs to supplement the family income, got a student loan to study medicine, became a colorectal surgeon, and gave back to society as a grassroots volunteer.
""My family and I are proof of the success of Singapore's meritocratic system,"" he said.
Dr Koh's story is typical of his generation: the poor but smart boy made good. Many of us in our 30s and older can identify with it, know people like that or have lived that journey from childhood want to adult plenty ourselves.
Meritocracy is a deeply held principle of conviction for those of us who benefited from Singapore's largesse of scholarships which sent legions of working-class children to top universities locally and worldwide. When we started work, Singapore's classless, truly equal opportunity ethos in the workplace allowed us to excel. And so social mobility was a reality we experienced.
It is not quite the same today. And so, while Dr Koh's story was moving, I think it would have resonated more deeply 20 years ago - 10 years, even five years ago.
Since then, the public awareness and discourse on meritocracy has shifted.
The talk these days is of how a meritocratic system based on academic ability breeds a new elite which passes on their advantages to their children. This creates an uneven starting point for children from homes with less money and poorer social capital.
A bus driver's son 30 years ago had a chance at excelling; would he still have the same shot at it, in today's Singapore? Or would a poor child, no matter how bright, be handicapped in a system where money buys you better pre-school education, enrichment classes, super tutors to move kids from A to A*, and priority admission to a good school at seven that will keep you till you're 16?
The PAP was the party that made meritocracy more than an ideal: it brought it to life for those born in the 1960s and 1970s, giving us the key to a good life.
But will it be the party that does the same for those born in the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s? Or is there a risk it might become the party presiding over a system where the new elite has a vested interest in preserving its advantages? Today's Singapore is seen by some as one where the very able is assured of a good future. Can the rest also find a niche for themselves to excel?
Not everyone can be among the academic elite. But perhaps people like my niece can form the vanguard of a new kind of Singaporean: one who excels in her chosen field, despite the lack of As.
This is what voters are concerned about: not the partisan battles on the ground among political players, but the question of which party, which values, which leaders, can create the best future for our children.

","   As the Singapore Conversation gathers pace, the Insight team examines present trends for a reading of the future, in a two-part special. This week, the focus is on the shifts that will shape society and politics.
A MIDDLE ground. That, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last November, is what has allowed Singapore to avoid the polarisation that has ensnared other developed countries.
Because Singaporeans across constituencies have similar interests and identities, politics here has managed to maintain a certain cohesion, he said.
But unhappiness in two areas that touch on fundamental principles on which Singapore's success has been built now threatens to decimate the middle ground.
1 Staying open to foreigners
As an influx of foreigners has caused Singapore's population to swell rapidly to 5.3 million in the last half-decade, a sense of economic threat and social anxiety has simmered among citizens hitherto open to newcomers.
As public infrastructure heaved under the strain, resentment grew against foreigners who faced a myriad of accusations: depressing wages, using Singapore as a stepping stone, and enjoying the privilege of living and working here without facing any of the obligations, such as national service.
Tales of foreigners behaving badly made the rounds online, from a Filipino boy who played the drums too loudly, to a family from China who objected to the smell of their Singaporean Indian neighbour's curry; from a Chinese student who thought Singapore had more dogs than humans, to drunk Caucasians assaulting a Singaporean taxi driver.
The political leaders' message that the country would sink without foreigners began to seem callous to those who felt the Singaporean way of life was under siege.
In the last few years, the Government has started to tighten its immigration framework, determined to reduce the economy's reliance on cheap foreign labour.
But it has made clear that turning away foreigners is not an option: In a paper released by its population unit last October, government demographers said that given the current birth rate of 1.2, the citizen population of 3.2 million will start shrinking in 2025 without immigration.
About 20,000 new citizens a year are needed just to keep this pool stable, almost twice the 13,000 a year Singapore has absorbed over the last decade.
2 Meritocracy and the income gap
Singapore has the most millionaires in the world, and also one of its highest measures of income inequality - a Gini coefficient of 0.47.
In the past few years, a niggling sense of social stratification has been borne out by worrying school data - first proffered by former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew in 2011.
He revealed statistics showing a gulf in the educational background of parents of students in top secondary schools versus those from neighbourhood schools. They showed that on average, half or more of those from brand-name schools had fathers who were university graduates. The corresponding figure hovered at around 10 per cent for neighbourhood schools.
Late last year, Education Minister Heng Swee Keat said four in 10 pupils in six top primary schools live in HDB flats, half the national average of eight in 10 pupils for all primary schools.
There are worries that the Singapore Story - of a meritocratic society that rewards hard work regardless of one's background - will not survive the decades ahead. The level playing field now seems inexorably tilted towards the privileged, upset by a tuition arms race and the social capital of those born into success.
While Singaporeans once lined up behind the goals of openness and meritocracy as the way a small, vulnerable nation could thrive, some now see in yesterday's solutions the seeds of today's problems.
In 20 years' time, will the border between the local and the foreign ossify into an impermeable barrier? Will the threshold between the rich and the poor - once crossable through hard work and talent - become an unbridgeable distance?
Whither the middle ground?

"," Population
","   BY 2025, if the birth rate does not improve from its current abysmal level of 1.2, the citizen population of 3.2 million will start to shrink.
To prevent this, the Government has projected that it will need 20,000 to 25,000 new citizens a year to keep the population stable, or growing slowly.
This is a more aggressive pace than over the past decade, during which 13,000 new citizens were added each year on average.
Already, the character of the local resident population has evolved considerably in the past 10 years. In 2000, 81.7 per cent of Singaporean residents were born in Singapore; in 2010, this dropped to 77.2 per cent.
In another decade, the proportion of ""native-born"" Singaporean residents will drop again, and probably by an even greater margin, given the predicted number of new citizens needed a year to stop the population from shrinking by 2025.
What it means to be Singaporean in 10 years may be very different from what it is now, just as it has shifted from 10 years ago.
The change in the Indian community, which has seen the most immigration, is the most pronounced and perhaps the harbinger of things to come.
When Ms Subina Khaneja, 50, moved here with her family from India in 1994, there were only two shops in Little India that sold the brown flour she used to make roti. Singaporean Indians, mostly descendants of immigrants from Tamil Nadu, make roti with white flour.
Two decades later, brown flour can be found in every shop in Little India, and in shops along the East Coast where a large population of expatriate Hindi-speaking Indians live, says the president of the Indian Women's Association.
Of the Indian residents here, 35per cent were not born in Singapore, compared to 6 per cent among Chinese residents.
The prevalence of brown flour may be a small matter, but it speaks to the way Indian newcomers have changed the social fabric of the ethnic community.
Their presence has also been felt in other, deeper ways: The household incomes of the Indian ethnic group has been pulled upwards by the affluent newcomers over the past decade, from $3,438 to $5,370. They are now the highest-earning ethnic group in Singapore, overtaking the Chinese.
In the next decade, the mix of ""new and Northern"" and ""old and Southern"" could move even more in favour of the former. There may come a day, some believe, when Hindi is used in the vernacular mass media.
The recent outcry over the addition of the Chinese names of MRT stations to train announcements also evinced an anxiety that social norms - in this case the primacy of English as the lingua franca in Singapore - are slowly shifting.
That the Singaporean identity will morph is a given; whether it manages to survive intact is the bigger question with further-reaching consequences.
Sociological studies show a community's sense of belonging and identity tends to become stronger when under pressure or intimidation from other groups, notes National University of Singapore sociologist Stella Quah.
In places like Dubai, the social compact is one where native-born citizens draw closer together in the face of a foreign influx - holding themselves separate from foreigners who are there only to work, and not expected to integrate or become naturalised citizens. Locals there are a privileged minority, showered with entitlements and subsidies to sweeten the presence of a huge contingent of foreigners.
Observers see signs of such a strategy being deployed here, as subsidies and benefits in education, health care and housing have become more tiered towards citizens in the past few years.
Earlier this year, three academics from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies proposed creating a revenue pool from the levies collected for Work Permit and S-pass holders. A one-off entry levy could be created for employment pass holders to contribute to this fund, they suggested.
The money would be earmarked for direct benefits to citizens in the form of an ""immigration bonus"".
Should Singapore take this Dubai-esque route, the national identity stays intact and unchanging - for the small, shrinking group of native-borns who are entirely cut off from foreigners in their land. Their acquiescence to immigration is economic in nature, and their relationship with foreigners transactional only.
But NUS sociologist Paulin Straughan sees two reasons this path is unthinkable for Singapore. The first is the high rate of inter-marriage between locals and foreigners - in 2011, four in 10 marriages were such cross-cultural ones. This speaks to a very porous division between who is local and who is foreign here, she says.
The second reason is that locals in the United Arab Emirates are bound by the strong thread of a common religion, the same marker that divides them from foreigners living and working there.
In contrast, there is no such binding commonality among Singaporeans, whose hotchpotch of races and religions - and the expectation of mutual tolerance and accommodation among them - is actually a central aspect of its national identity.
A natural capacity to absorb difference and diversity already exists in Singapore society, says Dr Straughan. This may help the national identity adjust to new, moulding forces without pulling away or fraying apart.
Observers hope to see Singapore following the American or Australian model of ""integration, but not assimilation"". Under a broad umbrella of values and aspirations that define the national identity, ethnic and cultural differences are allowed to flourish.
No one group is expected to be like another, as long as they all agree to subscribe to the common aspirational qualities of the national identity. In such societies, notes Institute of Southeast Asian Studies visiting research fellow Asad Latif, a thick layer of ""cultural assurance"" exists. ""In America, they have a strong sense of themselves. Immigration is not seen as a threat to identity, it does not touch the core of their being.""
He is confident newcomers can adapt to the local way of doing things, rather than insist on their old norms - as long as it is clear what is expected of them. ""Immigrants know what they don't want, not what they want,"" he says. ""It falls to us to offer them something they want. It comes back to our sense of ourselves.""
The respect for multiculturalism inherent in the Singaporean identity puts it in good stead to emulate countries like the US and Australia, but its small size and youth are hurdles which pose considerable challenges.
Ms Subina notes that her brothers, having lived in the US for some time, identify themselves as Americans. But for Indians like herself who have been in Singapore for decades, the same declaration is not as easy to make.
Her husband and children are naturalised citizens, while she is a permanent resident. ""There are things that Singapore stands for, like being corruption-free, meritocratic and multi-cultural. But these are not well-defined as aspirational qualities of the national identity. It's not clear that this is what makes you Singaporean.""
While ""core Singaporean values"" such as meritocracy and fairness are important to uphold, Behavioural Science Institute director David Chan suggests integrating foreigners into Singapore society need not start from such lofty points. ""More simply and directly, Singaporeans expect foreigners to subscribe to the same common principles of respect for multicultural differences, basic courtesy and being law-abiding individuals.""
Conversational ability in English is also an increasingly important marker of Singaporean identity, he adds, as it is the ""common interaction medium"" not tied to a particular race or cultural group.
But Singapore's youth and small size make its integration challenge greater than that of the US or Australia. Institute of Policy Studies' Dr Leong Chan Hoong says common cultural norms are integral to the formation of a strong ""national identity"" that binds foreign-born and native-born citizens.
In New Zealand, for example, he notes that supporting the All Blacks national rugby team is a must to be ""a part of them"" - ""These norms reinforce the notion of naturalisation.""
Such cultural norms are yet unformed in the Singapore context, if a 2012 IPS survey of 2,000 citizens - half local-born, half naturalised - is indicative.
Asked what makes someone Singaporean, the characteristics that emerged were vague. Besides ""respect for multiracial and multi-religious practices"", ""getting on well with neighbours"" and ""being gainfully employed"" topped the list.
Responding to the survey, Acting Minister for Social and Family Development Chan Chun Sing says the Singaporean identity is not yet fully formed because the country has had only four decades behind it. In contrast, the US Declaration of Independence was written in 1776, while the Commonwealth of Australia Act, creating one entity from the Australian colonies, was passed in 1900.
Economic growth, says Mr Chan, ""buys time"" for the Singaporean identity to form and strengthen. But the city state's size may be one challenge that time cannot overcome.
""Australia is huge. If you're not comfortable with the Vietnamese or Chinese, you can move to the north-eastern cities,"" points out Dr Leong. ""There is the hinterland, which mitigates a lot of the problems.""
For Singaporeans who are unwilling to accept a high level of immigration, there is nowhere for them to ""escape"" to, he notes.
In attempting to be both a global city, open to global talent, and a home for a native-born population on a small island, ""we are trying to do something unique in the world"", he adds.
But the Singapore story is built on being the exception. With time for cultural norms to solidify and intangible values to strengthen, the country in 2030 will not be an Asian Dubai but, hopefully, a miniature America.

","   FRENCH President Francois Hollande wants to abolish homework for all primary school pupils in France. It is part of his plan to improve the education system and devote more resources to helping kids from disadvantaged backgrounds.
The reasoning behind the homework ban is this: Affluent and educated parents can offer more help with homework, hence a system with no homework is more likely to help poorer families keep up.
Mr Hollande's argument is vigorously contested by experts. But the radical move speaks to the discomfort in France that education - meant to be the great social leveller - is actually worsening the gap between the rich and poor.
In Singapore, the same fear has festered; what parents sense to be true on the ground for a long time has, in the last few years, been borne out by worrying statistics.
In the top primary and secondary schools, a disproportionate number of students are from affluent and educated backgrounds: six out of 10 live in private property, when two out of 10 Singaporeans overall do.
About half of these students have parents who are university graduates, compared to about two out of 10 in neighbourhood secondary schools.
While social mobility has not halted, it is slowing. Singapore, say experts, finds itself nearing the edge of a cliff that other developed countries like France and the US have already fallen off.
If more active intervention is not taken over the next decade or two, the Singapore of 2030 may well find itself grasping at straws, considering such desperate moves as a homework ban.
The momentum of privilege is a powerful one. It places kids at different starting points in the race of life. And the pistol does not fire on the first day of school, but much earlier; the track does not consist just of time spent in class, but is also smoothened by hours of enrichment activities, tuition and yes, homework.
Placed against this backdrop, meritocracy perpetuates privilege in a resilient cycle. The problem is well-understood. How to meet it is a battle of philosophical proportions, one that observers see being waged over the next decade.
The Government has made its strategy clear: Last year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong defended meritocracy's central place in the Singapore story, emphasising that Singapore broke away from Malaysia in 1965 precisely because of its belief in meritocracy, rather than a system based on race, connections or wealth.
When it comes to levelling the playing field, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam has said that the Government's strategy is to push up the bottom without holding down the top.
While social and financial assistance is given to those from disadvantaged backgrounds, these must not distort the market of meritocracy or block ability and talent from rising to the top, the Government believes.
Mr Nizam Ismail, former chairman of the Association of Muslim Professionals, puts it this way when it comes to students in top education institutions: ""The Government will help with fees, not with placement.""
If children from disadvantaged backgrounds gain entry on their own merit to a top school, there is financial aid and bursaries galore. But the Government will not manoeuvre these students there in a bid to reverse-engineer social mobility.
Observers like education policy expert Jason Tan of the National Institute of Education argue that such help given to kids from disadvantaged backgrounds can only chip away at the barriers formed before their birth. ""The momentum that these measures build up is much less than the momentum of the cycle of privilege.""
While not advocating an alternative to meritocracy, observers and sociologists want to see it put in its proper place as a means to the end of social mobility, rather than an end in itself.
""The desired policy outcome should be a high and constant degree of social mobility, not just a meritocratic system,"" says Mr Soon Sze Meng, a board member of the non-profit Halogen Foundation. ""When meritocracy leads to social mobility, that's when it is doing its job.""
From this start-off point, meritocracy in the Singapore of the future looks very different, they say. For one thing, such a society must not only support a high degree of upward mobility, but also its corollary of downward mobility: a much less alluring prospect, but inevitable in a working meritocracy.
In the education system, such a a policy goal would mean removing the catchments where children of privilege are cushioned from facing the consequences of a lack of merit. These include a lower PSLE cut-off score for affiliated schools, or preferential primary school admission for the children of alumni.
The Government's long-term goals should also be viewed with a tweaked lens, suggest observers.
For example, it is now in the midst of a laudable effort to get more lower-income families to send their kids to pre-school, and to equalise the quality of pre-schools - in recognition that the starting point in the education system comes before the first day of primary school.
But accompanying this push should be measures to ""mix children from different backgrounds"", says National University of Singapore sociologist Vincent Chua. ""Research from the US shows that disadvantaged children reap very positive effects when mixed with stronger kids.""
Most importantly, an emphasis on social mobility sends the same message as an emphasis on meritocracy - with a significantly different thrust. Both tell those born to disadvantage that success is still within reach through hard work and ability. But a society which prizes social mobility holds up a collective goal, while one prizing meritocracy focuses on individual achievement.
The challenge should not be underestimated: A future Singapore that maintains a high degree of social mobility would be bucking the trend of developed societies.
In the US, the gap between the share of prosperous and poor Americans who earn bachelor's degrees has widened, according to researchers from the University of Michigan. Thirty years ago, there was a 31 percentage-point difference. Now, the gap is 45 points.
But the Halogen Foundation's Mr Soon sees Singapore as being in a better position to face down growing inequality, because its political system does not allow ""the 1 per cent"" to fund the campaigns of politicians who, in return, promise not to erode their advantages. ""Our political system makes it possible to enact such measures despite resistance from elites,"" he argues.
The cohesiveness and closeness of a small country could also ease the pushback, says Mr Nizam. Unlike in bigger countries, Singaporeans are not in silos of gated communities or urban slums. ""It's like giving to charity, but you now give that donation in the form of an acceptance that the less well-off deserve these opportunities, because you have a certain set of advantages that they don't. I don't think many would find that unpalatable.""
It would also be less facile than a national ban on homework. With a renewed emphasis on a Singapore story that promises social mobility through hard work and ability, the country may avoid confronting such a choice.

","   THE phrase ""Madam Speaker"" was uttered for the first time in Singapore's history yesterday as MPs elected popular People's Action Party (PAP) stalwart Halimah Yacob to head Parliament.
After Madam Halimah, 58, took her place in the Speaker's chair, six MPs rose to laud her tireless social advocacy during a decade on the PAP backbench, and a year as Minister of State for Social and Family Development.
This was the latest in a series of glass ceilings she has broken, they said, calling her a champion of women's rights and the pride of the Malay community.
Senior Parliamentary Secretary for National Development and Defence Mohamad Maliki Osman spoke of a Malay girl's rise from humble beginnings to high office.
""It is meritocracy regardless of gender, ethnicity or attire,"" he said, in a nod to the inspiring sight of a woman in a tudung presiding over Parliament.
The election of a new Speaker was the first order of business for the first sitting of the year. The position was vacated last month after former Speaker Michael Palmer resigned due to an extramarital affair.
Ms Denise Phua (Moulmein- Kallang GRC) proposed Madam Halimah for the role, seconded by Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC).
As hers was the only name put up, Madam Halimah was duly elected. She then walked to the Speaker's pulpit to chair-thumping from MPs, and Leader of the House Ng Eng Hen rose to speak, beginning with the historic two words ""Madam Speaker"".
He said that Madam Halimah was well suited to the role due to her ""formidable reputation as an active and ardent backbencher"" who championed the cause of women, families and children.
Her election comes ahead of a busy legislative calendar for Parliament, Dr Ng said, which includes a debate on the Population White Paper as well as this year's Budget statement.
Singapore is also on the cusp of transition as it faces the challenges of an ageing population and low fertility rates, while coming up against land and labour constraints.
Meanwhile, other Asean countries - with their younger populations and natural resources - pose stiff competition to Singapore for investments, and the external economic environment remains uncertain, he added.
He said that he expects Madam Halimah's ""firm and impartial hand"" will move parliamentary debate to fruitful outcomes over important national issues.
In their speeches, both Ms Phua and Mr de Souza recalled that Madam Halimah joined them in not voting for the 2009 Human Organ Transplant Act as they worried that the ability to pay for organs would be abused.
Mr de Souza praised her ""independence of thought"", while Ms Phua said the incident was one of many that showed Madam Halimah's ability to take a principled stand ""without being unnecessarily harsh"".
Minister of State for Transport and Finance Josephine Teo and Nominated MP Mary Liew spoke of Madam Halimah's career as a labour lawyer and union leader.
The National Trades Union Congress has appointed Madam Halimah as an adviser for international affairs.
After the deluge of accolades, Madam Halimah rose.
She said that she expects debate in the House to be vigorous - as it should be, as the rigorous examination of policy improves it.
She also wanted to reassure members of the public that while the Speaker cannot take part in parliamentary debate as she must be impartial at all times, she would continue to fight for social causes through other channels.
Then, she got to work.
Signalling the start of the sitting in earnest, Madam Speaker sat back down, and called for questions for oral answer.

","   PRIME Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday affirmed the importance of meritocracy in Singapore, arguing that any downside can and would be mitigated by the Government.
Spelling out how it works, he said all would get a chance to compete fairly, and the best man would get the most difficult job and be rewarded accordingly.
But there must also be consolation prizes for the rest, he said.
""How big a consolation prize, how you define winners and losers - that is something we have to discuss,"" he said, adding that the definition of winners here has broadened over the years to recognise, for instance, those in arts, social service and sports.
Mr Lee acknowledged meritocracy had its weaknesses - such as a tendency to widen the income gap - but said the Government was working to mitigate these problems in two ways.
One, it was making sure the opportunity to move up remained available to all. He said: ""If you make the effort, you can make the next step. You may have gone to N levels. You can work hard, you can make it to O levels, you can get to the polytechnics, you can get to university. Some people go on to do PhDs - not everybody, but the door is open.""
Two, the Government would balance income distribution through wage policy.
He said: ""Within Singapore, we can say... you're a school teacher, you may not be a top lawyer, but I make sure that you're also paid properly.""
But society also had a role to play in changing mindsets.
In the education system, for example, he noted how difficult it was to counter the view among parents that if one's child did not get into a certain course or stream, his future was bleak.
""To persuade parents to accept that their sons or daughters can be happy in different ways, that is something which is not just what the Government says but really social attitudes and social perspectives,"" he said.
In an earlier session at the Singapore Perspectives Conference, Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong pledged that even as Singapore continued to practise meritocracy, it would guard against two negative forms of it.
These include an excessively competitive one in which individuals sought to advance their interests at the expense of others, and one with a ""closed group of winners"" in which advantages are ascribed by birth.
""What we want is to shape a system of meritocracy in Singapore that works for the benefit of all, and is consistent with our ideals for a fair and just society.""

","   Three speakers at the Institute of Policy Studies Singapore Perspectives conference on Monday spoke about the challenges of governance for a rapidly changing Singapore. Here are excerpts of their comments.
THERE was a sense in the first-generation leaders that ""life is tough, we are vulnerable, we don't have many options"". The political model fostered was one that facilitated quick policymaking and implementation. It rested on a dominant one-party system promoting consensus and an overall depoliticisation of issues.
Over the years, the People's Action Party leaders have modified their political style, but not the political model.
It was a paradigm that worked. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's leadership style was more approachable and different from Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has evolved his own style, part compassion, part firm leadership. With both leaders, Singapore's political space opened up gradually. The success of the governing model and the policies is reflected in the positive changes in our population. So the ground has changed and expectations have changed.
The census data between 1970 and 2010 show Singapore's demographics have been reshaped. Singaporeans are better-educated, university-educated, overseas-educated and holding better jobs. The success of PAP policies over time was ground-changing.
The May 2011 General Election was a watershed. A critical mass of voters sent a message to the ruling party. They want a stronger opposition presence in Parliament. The vote went 60.1 per cent and 39.9 per cent. More than one in four voters were in the 21-34 age groups; 8.5 per cent of the electorate were first-time voters. There were issues - rising cost of living, inflation, and income inequality, influx of foreigners causing job displacement, particularly in the PMET group, and lowering of wages.
The social media revolution gave voice to and amplified the dissatisfaction and opposition views. Singaporeans are now more vocal, more demanding of their rights, have lost their fear of speaking up and voting for the opposition. Politics has become competitive again. The political culture has altered.
The ruling party responded swiftly. They were in a listening mode. They recognised the social contract had broken down and they would have to build a new consensus if they were to win back support to continue with its dominance.
I think the PAP knows it has to find the new balance. But it faces a classic dilemma. Do you get rid of a model and a set of policies that have worked and in many ways continue to be relevant?
The existential context of Singapore has not basically changed. The vulnerabilities are still there though they may be in a different form. Today it is not about survival but keeping competitive or risk irrelevance. And policies relating to our founding values of multiracialism, multilingualism and multi-religions, law and order, non-corruption, meritocracy and open economy should not be given up, for we will be diminished or destroyed. But other policies which I consider second order policies, such as certificates of entitlement (to buy cars), foreign talent, housing prices, can be reviewed and improved.
I read a very good nuanced piece by Jeremy Au, a young journalist, in The Straits Times of Jan 12. He was writing about politics in 2030. Au argues that ""if there is a consensus about the trajectory of Singapore politics, it is that there is an unstoppable drift towards liberalisation"" and for some ""the true mark of Singapore's arrival is the establishment of a two-party system"".
But Au points out that a poll in the NUS recently of 400 students ""found no clear desire among the young for a two-party system"".
How long the present model will last depends on what the PAP does in terms of policies, retaining its support and if it continues to recruit good political talent into the party. It also depends on how well the opposition parties do in recruiting talent and the policies and programmes they offer.
And, we do not know what coming challenges in the external context could impose on our political environment.
But one thing is clear, Singaporeans know what the PAP has done in building up Singapore. They do not worry about sovereignty, territorial integrity or the economic future of the country. They take all that for granted. What the bulk of the voters ask of the Government is ""What have you done for me today?""
So going forward, the legacy is important, but it will be a competitive fight for support.

","   The White Paper's projections have a big impact on jobs and growth, quality of life and people's sense of home. Robin Chan and Leonard Lim report
THERE were pages of numbers, charts and detailed explanations but only one question seemed to matter to many: Must it be 6.9 million?
Many are troubled by the eye-popping figure. It means Singapore is set to add up to 1.6 million people over the next 17 years, raising the density - the number of people per sq km - from about 11,000 to 13,000.
That is according to the Ministry of National Development's calculation of net density, which is the number of people per sq km of developable land. Based on that, even with 6.9 million people, Singapore will have a far lower density than Hong Kong or Seoul.
Developable land excludes water bodies, woodlands and wetlands as well as land set aside for defence purposes. Still, some economists say social costs will increase more rapidly, the higher the population density.
Dr Vu Minh Khuong of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy says: ""This can range from traffic jams to crimes, from housing shortage to social tension."" He points out that many smaller cities with populations of three to five million do well, such as Berlin, San Francisco, Toronto, and Taipei.
National University of Singapore associate professor Pow Choon-Piew says many people who live in dense cities like New York, London or Shanghai have made a conscious decision to do so. They are ""psychologically predisposed to accept crowded living conditions"", in return for the perceived benefits of such city living.
Many Singaporeans, however, have not made that choice but feel saddled with it as citizens of a city-state.
Ms Yolanda Chin, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at the Nanyang Technological University, says the White Paper appears to have let economic growth dictate population size.
""Perhaps we should be putting the population horse before the economic cart, by starting with the population size we are comfortable with on this island, and then extracting the maximum economic benefits from it,"" she says.
But other economists argue differently. Even at 6.9 million, Singapore would still be smaller than Hong Kong, Shanghai, Jakarta, London, New York and many other leading cities. It therefore needs to build up a critical mass.
Moreover, increasing the population size is necessary to overcome an ageing population, says associate professor Tan Khee Giap, co-director of the Asia Competitiveness Institute.
Singapore's anaemic fertility rate means that, by 2025, if there are no external additions to the population, more people will leave the workforce than join it.
And given that more Singaporeans will be better educated by then, the workforce is expected to be made up of predominantly white-collar job seekers - their share rising from about half today, to two-thirds.
Prof Tan adds that the economy will become increasingly services-based. With the transition, it will not be as simple as taking a worker from a manufacturing job and putting him in a service one. New workers will be needed.
Thus, what the White Paper has presented is a projection based on sobering social and economic realities, says Prof Tan.
""The paper is simply saying that due to the nature of the economy, the ageing population and having more PMETs in the workforce, we must have this population growth,"" he says.
But even assuming that is true, what of the physical limits? For those worried whether tiny Singapore can handle a population of nearly seven million, Mr Hazem Galal, an expert on cities at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says it can be done. Cities five million to 10 million in size face similar dynamics in terms of how people move about, he says. What makes the difference is the way population growth is managed.
""It is not just about adding bodies to the population, but about adding the right people and investing in citizens, giving them the conditions so they can enhance their innovation, and upgrade their skills. It is important to proactively manage the type of migration population you are attracting to Singapore,"" he says.
Technology and meticulous planning have also allowed cities to increase their density while maintaining or even improving the quality of life.
One way Singapore can do so is to create multiple central business districts, so that people can live, work and play in different areas of the city, instead of having to criss-cross the island every day just to get to work, says Mr Galal.
In short, says Mr Manoj Vohra of the Economist Group, this means that ""physical limits"" are no longer a static concept.
The Land Use Plan released on Thursday goes some way in addressing space and quality of life issues. Golf courses will make way, military training grounds will be consolidated and industrial areas reorganised.
Mr Vohra says: ""With advances in urban planning - an area where Singapore is already among the leading countries in the world - cities today can support a much bigger population than the conventional wisdom would suggest.""
What seems apparent is that for Singaporeans to accept that the population will grow to 6.9 million, they will have to imagine a Singapore quite different from today's.

IT TOOK a few days to sink in, but Singapore's business owners seemed to collectively recoil in shock at the gross domestic product growth rates projected in the White Paper on population.
The Singapore Business Federation (SBF), which has more than 1,000 firms under its umbrella, says plans to slash workforce growth would ""constrain businesses and limit growth"" and ""have devastating consequences for many companies"".
The paper projects that labour force growth will be halved in this decade. From 3.7 per cent growth from 2001 to 2010, it is estimating just 1 per cent to 2 per cent growth till 2020 and, beyond that, growth of just 1 per cent.
This will in turn slow economic growth from about 6 per cent in the last decade, to 3 per cent to 5 per cent a year till 2020, and to a slower 2 per cent to 3 per cent a year in the decade after.
The moderation is due primarily to a steep reduction in the number of foreigners allowed into the country in order to ease the strain on infrastructure and society, as well as to an ageing society.
SBF chief executive Ho Meng Kit warns: ""If businesses go under, jobs will be lost... If businesses cannot raise productivity and sustain profits, they cannot afford to pay Singaporeans higher salaries.""
Economic growth allows for new jobs, and incomes to go up, and gives firms room to expand and seize new opportunities.
Mr S. Iswaran, Second Minister for Trade and Industry, says: ""If we want to support the aspirations, then we need a certain level of growth that will ensure vibrancy, a certain pep in the economy to create more opportunities, not just for Singaporeans in terms of jobs but also for our businesses.""
Many point to the example of once-dynamic Japan. An ageing population, coupled with a tight immigration policy, resulted in decades of lost growth.
Japanese firms saw their profits fall, and faced a shortage of workers because more were retiring from the workforce than joining it. Reports were rife of skilled Japanese workers leaving the country for better prospects abroad, including Singapore.
But not all are convinced by that argument. While critics do not question the need for growth, they do disagree on just how much is enough.
Mr Yeoh Lam Keong, the vice-president of the Economic Society of Singapore, is among those who think the labour force growth projections are overdone. He says that the experiences of Switzerland and other developed countries have shown that it is possible to generate enough high-quality jobs for locals with a slightly slower labour force growth trajectory.
With less focus on growth, Singapore can afford to expand its labour force at 1 per cent a year till 2020, which is the highest rate among the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, and then at an even slower 0.5 per cent a year thereafter, he adds.
The yang to the yin of workforce growth, is productivity.
Firms and countries are able to produce more with fewer people, because they are innovative and have technology to support them. Singapore can do so too, but that entails quite a firm belief that productivity will catch up fast enough here.
To meet the projected economic growth numbers, Singapore would need to average productivity rises of about 2 per cent to 3 per cent a year this decade, and about 1 per cent to 2 per cent in the next.
That is a daunting challenge. Singapore averaged just 1.8 per cent a year of productivity growth in the last decade. The OECD economies did even worse - with just 1.2 per cent growth a year in productivity over the same time.
Mr Manoj Vohra of the Economist Group is therefore sceptical that this can be achieved.
""There needs to be more scrutiny of this productivity growth assumption and potential 'what if' scenarios. Singapore can't take this for granted,"" he says.
Singaporeans desiring a slower growing population will therefore need to have faith that productivity can rise, or accept that their wages may rise more slowly and that companies may simply decide to invest elsewhere.
Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean has reflected that the paper's proposals ""strike a careful balance"" between two scenarios. The first is to grow the workforce as fast as in recent years but that would stress land and infrastructure. The second, to freeze workforce growth, would result in a loss of vitality.
The White Paper strives for a balance that will enable ""high productivity, good quality growth"" to bring Singaporeans good jobs and good wages, he says.
It is easy to get caught up in the numbers and to miss the bigger picture that the White Paper is pointing to - a future economy defined less by manpower growth, and more by innovation and technology.
That economy will be flexible and inventive enough to throw up new opportunities and to seize the opportunities that the global economy presents, and with a level of human capital that is creative and entrepreneurial, says Mr Manu Bhaskaran, the chief executive of Centennial Asia Advisors.
And that, is what will keep Singapore's competitiveness and dynamism going for some more years to come.

AT ONE end, more foreigners will mean a more dynamic, diverse and cosmopolitan Singapore.
But they will also bring noticeable change to the population make-up, and affect national identity and social cohesion.
That, in a nutshell, captures the trade-offs inherent in the debate over the country's foreigner policy, according to Mr Christopher Gee of the Institute of Policy Studies.
""Whilst a larger foreign population can increase the dynamism of a city like Singapore, immigrants may bring with them norms, values and behaviours that may at times clash with the established culture of the incumbents,"" he says.
The White Paper on population released on Tuesday makes clear that the Government will keep its doors open to three groups of migrant workers to ensure a thriving economy and society: those who can help meet the greying country's health care and eldercare needs; foreigners willing to take up low-skilled jobs in sectors such as construction; and global talent with cutting-edge skills and abilities.
It foresees 2.5 million foreigners here by 2030, a significant rise from today's 1.5 million. The citizen share of the population will fall to 55 per cent, from 62 per cent currently.
Of those numbers, political observer Zulkifli Baharudin says: ""Mathematically I'm persuaded by the White Paper numbers but emotionally, I'm not at all.""
Others, like Institute of Technical Education student Syahid Sulaiman, reacted with concern to the news that there would be up to a million more foreigners here by 2030. He acknowledges that foreigners are needed to fill occupations that Singaporeans shun, but he also worries that he will be squeezed out of the job market.
""We can bring foreigners in, but not that many,"" says the 20-year-old.
His is a typical view, that more foreigners will spell fiercer competition for good jobs, good homes and space - for which demand tends to outstrip supply. Another worry revolves around the less tangible aspect of the Singapore identity.
Sociologist Tan Ern Ser of the National University of Singapore says citizens are asking if immigrants can integrate well, and whether the Singapore identity risks being gradually eroded.
Going forward, he says it is important to enhance Singaporeans' sense of security, which can produce a generosity of spirit towards immigrants, and in turn build social ties.
The grassroots network is one avenue to tap, and for some time now the People's Association has had ""integration and naturalisation champions"". They reach out to new citizens through house visits, tea parties, and festive celebrations.
But can more be done?
The real and present danger, say some, is that Singapore will drift towards becoming like Dubai, a global city with a high proportion of foreigners but where locals feel disconnected, a place some have criticised for lacking in national soul. Of Dubai's population of approximately two million, only around 200,000, or 10 per cent, are citizens.
Maintaining a strong Singaporean core by encouraging marriages and parenthood - through incentives and support measures such as those announced two weeks ago - is one part of the equation.
But observers say nurturing a sense of Singapore as home is about more than numbers and monetary rewards.
Some believe what is key is ensuring meaningful friendships are forged between immigrants and citizens.
Mr Gee, with his colleague Yap Mui Teng, wrote in a paper titled ""Let's put some colour into Singapore's population roadmap"": ""Efforts to maintain, and even enhance, our Singaporean core population need to define what it means to be a part of this core.
""Our shared values, our common rights and obligations, our national identity.""
Mr Zulkifli says the ongoing national conversation is a good platform to flesh out and articulate the values and ideologies that Singaporeans treasure, whether it is meritocracy, respect and compassion for others, or the value of hard work.
""People who come to Singapore must know, and be attracted by, what we stand for. Then they will begin to embrace these things that we cherish,"" he says.
Efforts like the Community Engagement Programme, which involves the community in response plans for crises, have also helped build bonds, says sociologist Kang Soon Hock, and it is worth exploring if others can be rolled out.
The way forward in the immigration debate will require a delicate balancing act, and the experience of other countries indicates the issue cannot be easily resolved.
But political analyst Gillian Koh is hopeful that the leadership will take time to hear all views on the matter, even if they are contrarian.
""It will be the challenge of the political leadership - from political parties of all stripes - to give courage to all sides to speak up and be heard,"" she said.
Chua Chu Kang GRC MP Zaqy Mohamad admits tension over such a polarising topic will be inevitable, but adds: ""I hope this is not a plan cast in stone, and we can all work towards a consensus.""

","   It was a tough phone call.
One evening early last year, I rang my mother in India to tell her that my family and I were applying for Singapore citizenship.
By then, we had lived here for more than a dozen years.
""You can't do that,"" she spluttered, shock echoing over the phone. ""We raised you to serve your country. We thought you would return.""
She reminded me how my late father would have liked me to come home and join politics or the country's vibrant civil society to fight for justice and equality just as some of his relatives had done at the height of the Indian freedom struggle. I was reared on their stories of service and sacrifice.
Now it was my turn to be shocked - hearing long-forgotten parental expectations crackling through a long-distance line. But those were their dreams, not mine.
""I can't Ma,"" I protested weakly. ""This is home now.""
Born in Kolkata, a symbol of poverty the world over, I was raised by my parents to believe that education and wealth should be used not just for personal gain, but to craft positive change in the world around us.
They led by example, juggling jobs with volunteerism and tireless charity work, which my mother continues till today.
I grew up, went to the city's oldest college which had produced Nobel laureates and Oscar winners alike, and had a rich history of students who went on to combat social injustice.
On graduation, I moved to Mumbai, studied journalism, fell in love, got a job with the city's largest newspaper - and married even before my husband had completed his postgraduate studies.
It was the mid-1990s and a key part of my work involved covering a judicial commission of inquiry into the Hindu-Muslim riots that had paralysed the city between December 1992 and January 1993 .
Day after day, I sat in a crammed courtroom hearing survivors speak of loved ones - many of them women and children - raped and murdered because of their faith. At least 900 people had died, nearly two-thirds of them Muslim.
By the time the commission presented its findings in the late 1990s, the far-right party accused of inciting anti-Muslim hatred had swept into power with its pro-Hindu nationalist rhetoric.
This new government rejected the findings - some of which indicted its own party members. Murder cases were closed even before they went to court. There were whispers of a cover-up. Justice was not served.
As someone who had witnessed the riots and listened to victims, I was in shock.
Disillusioned by the far-right political currents sweeping the country at the time, my husband and I sought to carve out our destiny overseas. We weren't sure if the move would be permanent. But at that point, we just could not stay.
My husband, a graduate of one of India's top engineering colleges and a newly minted MBA degree holder, soon found jobs in the United States and Singapore.
We wanted our new home to be diverse and secular, where education, drive and hard work - rather than personal connections - would be passports to success. Both countries fit the bill but we had close friends and family in the US.
""You'll suffocate in Singapore,"" my best and oldest friend, who had settled in Boston, wrote to me in an e-mail I have preserved till today. ""Come, instead, to the Land of the Free.""
We didn't. What tipped the scale in favour of Singapore is ironic, given the fertility crisis gripping this nation today. I was a new mother and thought this Little Red Dot was an easier and safer place than America to raise a child.
Indeed, Singapore still ranks higher than most developed Western nations, including the US, in the latest list of best places to be born in, released recently by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
In our early years, we fell deeply in love with our adopted home, a gentler, kinder, far less crowded city than what it has grown into today.
We struck up easy friendships with Singaporeans. It was neighbours like the Queks and the Chins who helped us settle in. Our children played together. We celebrated Chinese New Year and Deepavali together.
We marvelled at the meritocracy, the rigorous work ethic and the social mobility. And as someone who had witnessed communal riots and spoken to victims who got no justice, I was enamoured of the racial and religious harmony here.
We became permanent residents and had our second child. I found fulfilment both as a mother and in my work as a journalist.
Perhaps because of where I had come from, I was drawn to write about underdogs in Singapore society: the elderly poor, low-income workers, the disabled and the mentally ill, single mothers and foreign workers. I won awards for my work, in Singapore and overseas.
More importantly, as I watched social policies evolve, and heard successive National Day Rallies, I believed that life was improving here with every passing day.
Then, things began to change. To combat an ageing population and flagging fertility rates, the Government began aggressively importing immigrants, spawning an ""Us and Them"" divide that, sadly, seems to be widening every day.
Singaporeans, most of whom descended from immigrants themselves, protested against being crowded out, and accused foreigners of a host of ills, from stealing jobs to cramming trains and pushing up property prices.
Some friends, both foreign and Singaporean, left, unwilling to face the growing stress, costs and crowds. Instead of rethinking our future, my husband and I did just the opposite.
We applied for and, a few months later, were granted citizenship here.
It's not unbridled material success or the glittering new skyline that made us seal the deal with Singapore. In our early 40s with children already in school, we don't qualify for most of the carrots being dangled by the Government at young PRs to take up citizenship.
So why now? No other place feels quite as much like home. This is our comfort zone. We take pride in the rule of law, in clean, efficient governance. As parents, we savour the safety of a culture free of guns and drugs - and that our teenage daughter can move around unaccompanied here, without worrying for her life or limb.
Above all, at a time when some say Singapore is past its prime, we still have hope. As fresh challenges emerge, we want to have a say in how this nation charts its future course.
Why did we wait so long? Allegiance I think does not grow overnight. Besides, as someone born in a flawed but strong democracy, I believe in the need for diverse, alternative voices in the national discourse. The 2011 elections made some headway in providing just that.
By the time Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong invited citizens to help write the next chapter of the Singapore Story through the National Conversation last year, I was glad I had taken the plunge.
But what of the rather startling announcement last week that by 2030, we may need to make room for many more foreigners on this already crowded island, as the population heads toward 6.9 million? Is the National Conversation over? I hope not.
Even the Prime Minister has said it's a ""worst case scenario"".
If Singaporeans work together to live up to the pithy and powerful words of our National Pledge - and have more babies - the prospect of 2030 will be far less daunting than it appears today.
As a working mother who has found much joy raising two children, I firmly believe more here should give parenthood a chance.
After all, the future of democracies is determined not just by policy papers but by the collective will of the people. Individuals can indeed shape their own destiny.
As my parents taught me all those years ago, each of us has within us the power to craft positive change. We cannot give up without a try.

""We will preserve the Singapore character of our society. In particular, we will maintain the ethnic balance in our citizen population,"" Mr Lee said yesterday in Malay.
In the week-long debate on the Population White Paper, several MPs had expressed concern that the shrinking Singaporean core put forth in the paper would lead to a smaller Malay-Muslim share of the population.
Yesterday, Mr Lee gave the assurance that while Singapore is supplementing its population with an inflow of foreigners, it is slowing down the numbers to a more manageable pace.
""The proportion of Malays in the citizen population will not change, even over the longer term,"" he said.
Mr Lee also reiterated that ""Singaporeans will always be at the heart of all we do"". The Government will continue to give priorities to Singaporeans, including Malay Singaporeans, in all its policies, he said.
While meritocracy ensures that Singaporeans will succeed because of their abilities, the Government will continue to take care of those who need help ""to get back on their feet or to reach the same starting point in life"", he added, pledging to create more opportunities for all Singaporeans.
Mr Lee said the most important priority is to encourage Singaporeans to have more babies as none of the ethnic groups are replacing themselves.
He urged the Malay community to support the Government's population policy and take advantage of the recently enhanced Marriage and Parenthood package.

","   LEADERS and organisations from the Malay-Muslim community have yet to take a stand and to present their views on the White Paper on Population collectively.
But already there is an online buzz, with some focus and interest groups, and individuals expressing concern about the White Paper's impact on the community.
These online views are not necessarily representative of the entire community's sentiments.
In pondering over the White Paper, we will need to first remind ourselves that Singapore's society is based on social cohesion, unity, meritocracy and economic stability. As such, we should refrain from being emotional or be too quick to judge its contents.
Instead, we have an opportunity to give constructive and honest feedback rather than to cynically depict it as marginalising the Malay-Muslim minority.
Our leaders and organisations must take the lead in a concerted effort to improve the well-being of the whole community, and to ensure that everyone has a chance to attain greater success.
Even with our reduced numbers in the years ahead, the quality of the community can flourish and blossom to face the challenges of the future.
The most important challenge is: How to ensure that with the projected influx of foreigners and the anticipated economic uncertainties, Singaporeans are provided with the best jobs and the best homes. A way must also be found to ensure that the young remain rooted to Singapore.
So, while the exchanges on the White Paper have led to frank views and ideas - including a number from the Malay-Muslim community - the discourse must not give rise to divisions within Singapore society.
Since the White Paper is about charting a better future for all, the Malay-Muslim community will first need to acknowledge that despite its progress and achievements over the last three decades, it has not eradicated problem areas.
Dysfunctional families, drug abuse and juvenile delinquency remain tough challenges.
The Government has acknowledged the progress made in improving these problem areas. However, much work still needs to be done. We need to unite within the community to eradicate these problems and find effective sustainable solutions.
Thus, while it is understandable for the community to be concerned about a shrinking percentage of the Malay population here, the focus should really not be on dwindling numbers, but on levelling up capabilities within the community.
How can our community contribute and become more competitive to achieve more and make significant contributions to society? Strength does not necessarily come with numbers, but unity does.
We must continue to evolve, upgrade, participate, engage and be prepared to face future challenges.
It is essential not to whine about our circumstances but rise up to the occasion and focus on being relevant rather than being redundant.
This should be our focus: To unite as a community working with other communities to ensure the Singaporean Identity is embedded in our young, to continue to be a distinct ""core"" regardless of our percentage in the population, and being rooted in our faith and beliefs that make us who we are.
In responding to the White Paper, let us firmly keep faith in Singapore's system of meritocracy which ensures equal opportunity to excel for all.
The Malay-Muslim community, though small, should not have qualms about playing a significant role and contributing to society.
It is up to us to become the ""cili padi"" (a small but potent chilli and a favourite ingredient in local dishes) that packs a real punch in the recipe of Singapore's success - by playing a more significant role in the future of our economic and social development.
Beyond our community's particular concerns and what needs to be done, we should also be engaged in the general discourse on the White Paper, and contribute constructive ideas, say, on the foreign workforce we will need.
Many Singaporeans have questioned and even doubted the need for a large number. What is needed is a road map that prepares Singaporeans to face the next few decades, and our community must actively contribute to it.

This should be our focus: To unite as a community working with other communities to ensure the Singaporean Identity is embedded in our young, to continue to be a distinct ""core"" regardless of our percentage in the population, and being rooted in our faith and beliefs that make us who we are.

",NA,"   WORKERS' Party chairman Sylvia Lim said in Parliament that ""for the Singapore core to be strong, the core must be strongly Singaporean in values, world view, culture, sense of place and history, and network of friends and family"" (""WP rejects road map, offers its own""; Feb 5).
But Ms Lim did not elaborate on what exactly these are. I would like to share my perspective.
In its early years, Singapore thrived as an entrepot hub. Migrants from Europe and Asia settled here to earn a living. Some stayed, while others returned to their home countries.
Following independence from Britain, Singapore merged with Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak to form the Federation of Malaysia. However, disagreements emerged over values - while the federal government believed in entrenching special rights for the native people, Singapore subscribed to meritocracy, the idea that success should be dependent on ability.
Being a small island nation, Singapore has been able to punch above its weight globally because its citizens have always looked beyond its borders and not inward, and have been willing and able to compete with the best and brightest in the world.
We have traditionally been welcoming of friends from overseas and some of us, myself included, have parents who were born overseas but came to Singapore seeking a better life. My grandmother left China with my father in the year he was born.
This forms part of my identity as a Singaporean - not the fact that I was born and bred here, not because I attended local schools and certainly not because I went through national service (an especially ridiculous argument which implies that only male Singaporeans can be truly Singaporean).
Thus, I am saddened that many Singaporeans seem to have adopted such a negative attitude towards foreigners and immigration. We are a great country because of them and not in spite of them.
Granted, strains from the past few years are evident, but we have to figure out how we can adapt as a people and ensure that our infrastructure keeps pace with the increase in population.
Restricting the flow of immigration and closing the door to foreigners go against the very values, world view, and sense of place and history that make Singapore strong.
Don't turn our country into a place we truly do not recognise.

","   I WAS born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), lived in Britain and Sierra Leone (West Africa), came to Singapore in the 1970s as an economic migrant and then became a Singaporean.
Whenever I wonder why I am a Singaporean, the late Mr S. Rajaratnam's assurance resonates with me.
He said: ""There are many parts of the world where to be a minority is to be resented and be oppressed. In the kind of Singapore we are creating, there are no majorities and minorities but simply good men and bad men, with good men, whatever their race, language and religion, invariably triumphing over the bad men, whatever their race, language and religion.""
I am proud to be a Singaporean because the Government:Upholds the principle of meritocracy - a citizen's race, religion, language, caste or gender doesn't count.
As a result, my family also prospered in tandem with Singapore; andKeeps religion separate from politics - MPs, ministers and all government agents do not invoke their religious faiths to support their arguments.
And, while religious groups practise their faiths freely, none of them or their representatives is allowed to interfere in the functioning of the Government or to proselytise.
Begging is illegal in Singapore and yet no citizens are deprived of food, clothing or shelter - there are many government-backed charities and voluntary organisations to look after the less fortunate.
While I am free to move around in Singapore at any time without being anxious
about my safety and security (barring accidents), I am not discriminated against, resented or oppressed by the Government or my fellow Singaporeans because my mother tongue is Tamil, I am dark-skinned and not a ""born and bred Singaporean"".
Any attempt to propagate the false idea that a ""born and bred Singaporean"" is superior to a Singaporean by choice is retrogressive, contradictory to the principle of meritocracy and, above all, undermines the Singapore Pledge.
I strongly believe that the immigrants who become Singaporeans will help to enlarge the secular space in Singapore so that all ethnic and religious groups can easily adopt the attitude of behaving with self-respect and respect for others.

","   IN THE past fortnight, there has been much discussion about the Population White Paper. An important aspect was the Singapore core.
My family and I have lived in Singapore for nearly two years. From what I have seen, the issue is not about Singaporeans on one side and foreigners on the other.
The Singapore core is, for me, best described by three attributes that have made the country so successful in the past.
The first attribute is tolerance, particularly racial and religious tolerance.
Having lived in Europe, the United States and Africa, I find Singapore the most tolerant place of all. Except for New York and London, I know of no other place where race and religion are so well respected and even celebrated together. Such tolerance has helped Singapore become a truly global and colourful place.
The second attribute is meritocracy. Performance, hard work and skills generally pay off for those who possess or apply them.
People with talent can enter the best universities and take up top public-sector positions; their social backgrounds do not matter. This has resulted in strong and effective institutions.
The third attribute is team spirit. I refer particularly to members of the first generation after Singapore's independence, who showed the willingness to forgo individual benefits for the sake of a bigger common goal.
This team spirit and commitment to work together have been the foundation upon which to define one vision and find solutions accepted by most.
All three core attributes are being tested today. The rising cost of living, together with the prospect of becoming rich through the allocation of capital rather than labour, poses all kinds of challenges.
Also, Singaporeans are striving for even bigger goals than just economic prosperity.
This is a good thing but should not come at the expense of the core attributes.
It is worthwhile for everyone living here to be aware of these attributes and to always cultivate them together.
Then the question of how many people will be living in Singapore by 2030 will become secondary.

"," Proposals
","   The large turnout at the protest rally two Saturdays ago against the Population White Paper culminated in calls from some participants for a referendum on the issue.
Judging by the anger that has raged against the paper's proposals, the outcome of such a poll seems a no-brainer. It is as clear as day that the White Paper has gone down badly.
Congestion on the roads and trains, skyrocketing property prices, heightened competition for jobs, schools and other amenities, have all combined to make the idea of having almost two million more people added to this tiny island seem like one of those ""foolhardy"" or ""courageous"" suggestions that politicians make at their peril.
It all made me wonder how a similar proposal to boost the population might have gone down in the 1980s, when the quest for economic growth was not as unfashionable as it is today. Would the population, which then hovered around 2.5 million, have come out in support of doubling this in a few decades?
Even then, it would have been a hard sell.
One reason stems from what psychologists call the ""end of history illusion"".
A recent New York Times report citing a study in the journal Science noted: ""When we remember our past selves, we seem quite different. We know how much our personalities and tastes have changed over the years.
""But when we look ahead, somehow we expect ourselves to stay the same... we underestimate how much we will change in the future.""
The same might apply to societies. So, just as it was difficult for anyone living in the 1980s to picture the Marina Bay of today, a spaghetti network of MRT lines running across the island, or three terminals at Changi Airport, most people extrapolate from their experiences today to form a picture of what the future might be like, as if society has reached its zenith and ""history"" has ended.
Little wonder then that all the grand plans unveiled recently for new homes, more MRT lines, additional parks and recreation options seemed remote. At best, the proposals were plausible; at worst, just so much political pie in the sky.
Most of us live in the here and now. Quite naturally, people want to see their current concerns being addressed, bottlenecks fixed, runaway costs checked, before they will believe that things might get better, as promised.
So, ironically, the upshot of this is that the White Paper, which was meant to make the case for a more moderate and calibrated pace of immigration, has ended up making the idea of further inflows of people all the more unpalatable politically.
Singapore, someone pointed out to me, is living through another Howe Yoon Chong moment.
Remember Mr Howe? He was the top civil servant-turned-minister mostly known for an ill-fated report in 1984. Like the recent White Paper, it too was focused on the challenges faced by the ageing of Singapore society.
By most accounts, the report contained some sensible ideas. But one controversial proposal to raise the Central Provident Fund withdrawal age from 55 to 60 sparked a furore. It proved so politically toxic, tarnishing the entire report, that few can recall anything else in it.
There was much dark talk of ""betrayal"" by the Government of the day, and murmurings about a backlash at the next polls. Politicians beat a hasty retreat, and it was only several years later that they took another stab at the underlying issue of people needing more retirement savings, when the CPF Minimum Sum scheme was introduced in 1987.
Then, as now, the idea that you could simply set out the facts, make a rational argument and win people round to the need for ""painful but necessary"" measures, proved overly optimistic. As was the case then, the latest White Paper has made tackling Singapore's rapidly ageing society more - not less - challenging politically.
Worst of all, the strong reactions to the recent proposals have emboldened latent xenophobes, who now see an opportunity to whip up public unhappiness for their own ends. Today, it is not uncommon to hear people say: ""I am really not against foreigners, but..."", before launching into a tirade against immigrants, or spewing some racial stereotype, and leading up to an anti-government diatribe.
Some have begun to mouth empty slogans such as ""Singapore for Singaporeans"" or ""born and bred Singaporeans"". There was even one outlandish posting on Facebook calling for ""ethnic cleansing of FTs from Singapore"".
The idea is absurd. Where would we draw the line separating ""born and bred"" Singaporeans from others to be spurned - 1965? If so, many of us would have to disavow our own parents or grandparents as interlopers. Or should we push it back to 1819? In that case, most of us, except for a few Malay families, would have to pack up and ship out to wherever our ancestors came from.
Let me be clear: It is perfectly legitimate to debate, and disagree with, the government's proposals. Like many others, I share the unease over the ramping up of immigration that led to the current infrastructure bottlenecks, and fed the collective angst over the White Paper.
But it is a fine line between this and vilifying foreigners to use xenophobia for political ends, wittingly or otherwise. Right-minded Singaporeans will have to guard, and speak out, against this.
For, when the political heat cools, Singaporeans are going to have to pick up the pieces and figure out a way forward. To my mind, finding common ground is likely to entail the following:Coming to grips with the fact that Singapore has an ageing population. No doubt, some will blame this on past government policies. Even so, there's just no running away from the problems that loom. Most of us around today are likely to live through the effects of a major slowdown in our society and economy in the decades ahead. Either we do something about it now, or rue the consequences later.Dealing with this will require efforts to boost our birth rate, raise productivity and move the economy up the value chain. And yes, it is likely to call for some degree of immigration. The precise number is worthy of debate, but clearly the doors will have to be kept open, and the population will continue to grow.After all, Singapore was not built just by ""born and bred"" natives. It owes its success to our disparate immigrant ancestors' willingness to work together. It also took investments, skills and ideas from people from all round the world - such as Dutch economist Albert Winsemius for several years from the 1960s - as well as the sweat and toil of foreign construction workers, nurses, service staff, maids and cleaners, without whom this city would grind to a halt.So, those who speak disparagingly of ""foreigners"" or ""FTs"" (short for foreign talent) do a grave injustice to the founding ideals our forefathers held dear - of equality and meritocracy, ""regardless of race, language, or religion"".Ultimately, being Singaporean is as much an act of faith and will, rather than any geographical or ethnic lineage. Most Singaporeans, I believe, accept this and do not share the ""little islander"" mentality that some now espouse so vociferously and venomously.
But, unfortunately, recent events have raised the political temperature, and stakes. It is going to take much effort all round to ensure that Singapore remains open to the world and yet coheres internally, and to prevent that age-old refrain that haunts all fledgling and disparate societies - ""things fall apart, the centre cannot hold"" - from becoming a dreaded reality.

","   ON FIRST reading, the article (""Clearer learning goals set for pre-schools""; last Thursday) can make one feel quite optimistic as it appears that the common standard for pre-schools would help to address problems in our stressful education system.
However, upon getting to the minimum guidelines set out, as well as the optimistic aim of discouraging ""overteaching"", many parents would not feel the same.
First, many pre-schoolers have already progressed beyond the minimum standards.
Second, and more importantly, many parents push their children very hard because they are looking beyond pre-school education to the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and further.
Unless the authorities make a genuine effort to modify the current exam system such that it does not favour parents with the resources to pay for excessive tuition for their children, shifting the little goalposts at pre-school level will not reduce the tendency to overteach; the final goalposts at the PSLE level and beyond are still there.
Last Tuesday's article (""Tuition firms outsmart NY test planners""), which talks about parents paying tuition agencies to prepare their children for kindergarten gifted programmes, highlights an issue many Singapore parents are familiar with - that one can help children do well in local exams by providing them with lots of targeted tuition.
Dr Samuel Goldman, in a review of the book Twilight Of The Elites: America After Meritocracy, suggested that ""rich (American) parents have discovered strategies to game the system"".
""By buying cognitive enhancements like foreign travel, music lessons, tutoring in difficult subjects, and outright test prep, these parents give their kids a substantial leg up.""
Doesn't this sound exactly like our Singapore education system?
This is just one of the uncomfortable facets of our widening rich-poor gap, and our education system should and must be improved upon to address this.
The authorities' move to standardise learning goals for pre-schools is a nice tweak.
I hope that this is but one of the many tweaks to come that will help make our education system more equitable for every parent, whether rich or poor.

","   WORKERS' Party (WP) chairman Sylvia Lim yesterday paid a nod to the Government's move towards a more progressive tax system in this year's Budget, but said there is room to do more.
She ""acknowledged"" the shift, saying it is ""symbolically and psychologically important"" to have a system where those with more contribute more to the national coffers to help those in need.
""It signifies that Singaporeans are journeying together as one people towards the future, with the stronger helping the weaker,"" said Ms Lim (Aljunied GRC).
It also reduces the need to raise other taxes such as the goods and services tax which have a direct impact on the cost of living, she added.
She then laid out several proposals, including introducing more differentiation in the income tax for high-earners.
Currently, the highest tier of income tax charges 20 per cent for annual income exceeding $320,000, she noted.
This rate has not been adjusted for around a decade even though incomes at the higher end have soared, she said, adding that the bracket captures many professions, from a university professor who just qualifies for this tier to a top banker earning millions more.
Ms Lim called for more tiers for this group, from 20 per cent for those earning $320,000 to $500,000 to 25 per cent for those earning above $1 million.
This rate is still low globally while Singapore holds other incentives like low corporate tax rates, she said.
However, Minister of State Amy Khor (Hong Kah North) later warned that Singapore must be careful not to reduce its international competitiveness even as it looks into a more progressive tax system.
Mr David Ong (Jurong GRC) said later that Singapore should ideally have higher marginal taxes at the top end. However, there is the reality of Hong Kong which caps income tax at a 15 per cent effective tax rate for the highest income brackets, he said.
Hong Kong's top marginal tax rate is 17 per cent. But based on an income of US$500,000 (S$621,000), a KPMG report notes the effective tax rate for Singapore is about 16.6 per cent, higher than the 15 per cent in Hong Kong.
Mr Ong urged a careful study of any progressive taxation initiative before implementation.
Meanwhile, Ms Lim also noted the Budget's progressive shift towards taxing luxury cars and homes. But she cautioned that higher tax rates for owner-occupied homes should not unfairly penalise retirees who inherited or bought homes in good locations a long time ago.
There is another potential loophole in the new tiered tax rate for non-owner-occupied units, which is based on the property's annual value, she said.
A wealthy person could buy many mid-range properties and pay lower tax, she said. A fairer assessment would be each person's total property interest, she noted.
To drive home the importance of a progressive tax system, Ms Lim cited a study of 54 countries by University of Virginia psychologist Shigehiro Oishi which drew a link between higher progressivity in tax systems and greater subjective well-being of citizens.
The study ranked Singapore in the lower half of tax progressivity while Singaporeans' life satisfaction was lower than in several other developed countries.
In their speeches yesterday, Ms Lim and two other WP MPs also highlighted income inequality as an urgent issue to tackle.
Non-Constituency MP Gerald Giam cited economists such as Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz who have linked inequality to less economic growth and productivity as well as lower levels of trust in government and businesses.
Mr Giam and Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang) welcomed the Government's recognition that meritocracy alone is not enough to ensure social mobility and called for more to be done to help low-wage workers and the unemployed.
While the cash component of the Workfare Income Supplement payout for lower-wage workers has been raised from 29 per cent to 40 per cent, Mr Png asked for it to be increased to 50 per cent.
Otherwise, any increase in a low-wage worker's take-home pay might be negated by inflation and the rise in his Central Provident Fund contribution, he said.
Mr Giam proposed a ""New Hire Wage Credit"" scheme, a temporary wage subsidy to help small and medium-sized enterprises hire economically inactive or jobless Singaporeans, including the elderly, disabled and housewives.

","   As Singapore presses on with efforts to tighten its foreign workforce growth, the Manpower Ministry announced in the Budget debate last week that it will raise the requirements for Employment Pass workers, especially lowest-level Q1 pass-holders. These are workers earning between $3,000 and $4,500 monthly, who compete with locals for junior-level PMET (professionals, managers, executives and technicians) jobs. The ministry is also studying employment frameworks of other countries to develop one for Singapore to level the playing field. Political Correspondent Jessica Cheam speaks to Ms Su-Yen Wong, senior partner and Asean managing director at global human resource consulting firm Mercer, about the effect of these moves.
How do you think recent moves to tighten the foreign workforce will affect our labour market?
As foreign manpower is tightened, over time you'll get higher demand than supply. Already, unemployment levels are at their lowest, so in this situation, say if the criteria for Q1 workers are tightened, then wages in this segment will rise.
When organisations hire people, they look at the competencies and skills needed and they want the best person for the job, and they are willing to pay a premium for the right person.
As wages increase, prices will increase because people can afford to pay more so sellers will naturally want to increase prices; also, with wages increasing across the board, costs will go up and these costs will be passed on to the consumer.
You may find your $2 plate of chicken rice rising to $5 or even $10 as people in the whole supply chain earn higher wages and the costs of doing business rise.Would this have an impact on our competitiveness?
Yes, companies here don't only compete in Singapore, they compete regionally and internationally. It's important that we're still a meritocracy, to ensure that there isn't any discrimination. But we need to get the balance right.
Singapore in the past decade has done a remarkable job establishing itself as a destination for talent and an attractive place to live.
Looking ahead, the economic dynamic is changing, you can look around the region and there are countries like China and Malaysia offering incentives to attract talent, such as tax benefits, or investing heavily in infrastructure and public services to raise the quality of life to attract people to relocate there.
Everyone is engaging in this war for talent. The world is a much more globalised place and will continue to be, especially with emerging regions like Latin America and the Middle East.
These days, talent is mobile at all levels, it wasn't like that 20 years ago. The ability to get talent is a key aspect of a country's competitiveness.What do you think about this move to review the employment framework and adapt from other countries?
Some countries, like the United States, make it hard for companies to hire foreign talent. The H1B visa (non-immigrant work visa), for example, is very hard to get. Some analysts will tell you that the US is not as competitive as it used to be; it used to attract the best brains.
Now if companies can't get the talent they need, they'll just set up somewhere else. So there has to be a balance.
Singapore is trying to achieve this and there's no one-sizefits-all approach. I believe there'll be room for the right talent here, wherever they may be from.
My own observation is that there's a correlation between the degree of protectionism in a country and how unwell their economies are, when you compare countries like Britain with others which are open, expanding and growing, such as Brazil and India.
The other thing (about) the labour market in the US and other developed countries is that the stage of economic development is very different from Asia, where the pace of growth is much faster.
While Singapore might have a relatively lower growth rate, we are surrounded by countries and cities that are growing rapidly. So we can't afford to be protectionist.
The balance is a difficult one. While we need to make sure that in the long term, Singaporeans are getting the opportunities, development and wage levels they need, we also need to be mindful of the context that we operate in.
The trick is really how do we build a workforce that is flexible and adaptable.
The reason PMET unemployment in the older age groups is higher is that many of these workers might not have been able to adapt to changes over time. But if they can, they'll always be able to move and change.What other challenges do you foresee in this move to reduce our foreign workforce growth?
One problem many employers face is the difficulty of getting Singaporeans to take on certain jobs perceived to be low-end.
We have evolved to a stage where we prize certain types of degrees and jobs over others.
It becomes a ""desirability of job"" issue, where parents influence their children over what is an acceptable job.
In developed economies where wages at lower-end jobs are higher, you notice that being a tradesman or going on the vocational path is not seen as inferior, unlike here.
So it's a perception issue, on what's an honourable career, and this may need to change as our manpower needs evolve.Are companies here worried about further tightening?
I think the majority are positive about Singapore, that it will get the balance right. There are a few which may be worried as they have set up their research centres and headquarters here on the basis of the availability of talent. That's what companies are competing for globally right now. What companies don't have enough of, is the right people.How will these businesses cope with the wider restructuring effort and reduced foreign workforce?
The focus will have to be on productivity. Wages cannot go up unless this comes with some productivity gains, so it will be how to generate more revenue with fewer people.
This means redesigning work processes. For example, if you have a food and beverage outlet, you might need customers to fill out their orders instead of having wait staff take them.
Inevitably, it will come down to getting consumers to do more. I think companies will figure it out. They are willing to make the adjustments but many worry that the customers will not adapt. They will need time during this transition.
So we will see a lot more businesses requiring self-service on the part of the consumer, or the consumer must pay a premium for a higher level of service.

","   MR ROHIT Brijnath's commentary on Sunday (""Merit alone must matter in national team selection"") raised a salient point: ""To earn a place on any team is to acquire it through merit.""
This is a point that the Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA) has consistently failed to grasp.
In recent years, it has not been sending youth players for overseas competitions based on merit, with the upcoming Asian Youth Games (AYG) being the most recent example.
Rather, the STTA sends players from the Singapore Sports School's School Within A School (SWS) programme because it feels they are more committed.
But since when did commitment trump talent and ability as a barometer of success? It is a player's capabilities that should determine whether he represents Singapore.
STTA chief executive Wong Hui Leng states that the association ""will nominate players from the YOG training team based on the results in overseas competitions over the past 12 months, using the ITTF points table as a reference... According to that, Edric (Lim) and (Yee) Herng Hwee have the most points"" (""Explain paddlers' selection: SNOC""; Sunday).
But she has omitted a crucial point: Players in the national youth team are not given chances to represent Singapore in International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) competitions.
Despite petitioning from the parents of national youth team players, the STTA has refused to send them for ITTF competitions, even when the parents volunteer to pay the full cost of the trips.
It is no wonder that only SWS players have chalked up enough points to represent Singapore in the AYG.
STTA's indifference towards the national youth team is also reflected in its dismissal of demands to improve training conditions. These players train with an unacceptable coach-player ratio of one to 12.
By refusing to hold trials and select players based on merit to represent Singapore in most major competitions abroad, STTA goes against the grain of meritocracy - the foundation on which our nation's success was built.

","   The nature of inequality is changing and the pressure to take from the rich to give to the poor looks set to grow. Rachel Chang dissects the challenges ahead.
THE millennium was a turning point for economic inequality in Singapore.
From the year 2000, an income gap that was narrowing turned the corner and began to widen. The wages of skilled, top earners began to pull away from unskilled workers at the bottom, whose incomes stagnated.
This is the story of inequality in Singapore that the Gini coefficient alone - the most widely used measure of inequality - does not tell.
Singapore has always had a high Gini coefficient of over 0.4 due to its open economic structure. The Gini coefficient plots inequality from a scale of zero to 1, with zero representing completely equal incomes across a population.
Singapore's Gini actually rose more briskly in the 1990s - from 0.408 in 1990 to 0.442 in 2000, than in the noughties, when it went to 0.472 in 2010.
But it is only in the past decade that a gulf has opened up between skilled and unskilled workers.
Globalisation and a technological boom have powered the ""skills premium"" that highly qualified workers command worldwide.
In Singapore, it collided with local factors of an economic restructuring, a liberal intake of cheap foreign workers and an ageing demographic to explosive effect.
Singapore Management University economist Hoon Hian Teck's research shows that from 2000 to 2010, the economy moved decisively away from manufacturing to high-end services.
For example, foreign direct investment in the manufacturing sector, as a ratio of gross domestic product, shrank from 36 per cent to 21 per cent over this period, but grew in its financial and insurance services sector from 36 per cent to 43 per cent. This exacerbated the skills premium for high-end workers as demand for them grew faster than supply, he explains.
The millennial turning point is also reflected in the ratio of average incomes of the top fifth of earners compared to the bottom fifth.
This fell from 14.4 in 1980 to 10.1 in 2000, before U-turning. It has risen through the last 10 years; as of last year, top earners made 13 times what bottom earners made.
Thirteen years after its turning point, inequality has entered a new phase of urgency, say observers.
Unlike in the past, notes Nominated MP Laurence Lien, income inequality is no longer set to a backdrop of a ""rising tide that lifts all boats"". Then, ""most individuals and families felt that their plight was improving all the time and social mobility was higher"", says the chief executive of the Lien Foundation. Now, there is wage stagnation and some depression, not just for those on a low income, but for a wider group.
The 'inequality' word
FROM 2000 to last year, as the wage gap grew, the word ""inequality"" was conspicuously absent from the Government's annual Budget statement.
Competitiveness, rather than redistribution, was the order of the day. Following a global trend, top income tax rates were lowered throughout the decade from 28 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in 2006 for economic attractiveness.
But last year, the ""inequality"" word reared its head - three times at that, in Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam's Budget speech then. This year, he said it five times.
More noticeably, his rhetoric was sharply different.
In 2011, responding to MPs' concerns over the income gap, Mr Tharman said that ""(income inequality) is something we should be concerned with. But what matters most is not income inequality itself, but whether we succeed in raising incomes and living standards for all Singaporeans, including and especially the lower-income groups"".
In this year's Budget, which promised more social spending while hiking taxes on luxury cars and investment properties, Mr Tharman said that inequality is growing everywhere - but ""it matters more to us because Singapore is not just a city but also a nation. We must take further steps to temper inequality"".
Observers see a new direction - and a new determination - in the Government's redistributive efforts.
In the past few years, it has curbed the inflow of foreign labour, cajoled companies to invest in enhancing productivity, and expanded its skills training programme to ""upgrade"" workers.
It is also redistributing significantly straight from government coffers to low-income and older workers' pay cheques, through schemes such as the Workfare Income Supplement, the Special Employment Credit and the Wage Credit.
""The Government deserves a lot of credit for really pushing the restructuring this time. There is a lot of resources being put in here,"" says Institute of Policy Studies research fellow Tan Meng Wah.
But economists and experts point to blind spots, and say it remains to be seen if the Government's new zeal can keep up with inequality's own momentum.
The effort to boost productivity should raise incomes, but ""this does not mean that nothing else needs to be done because rising wages is only one part of the problem"", says the chief executive of Centennial Asia Advisors, Mr Manu Bhaskaran.
The retired, elderly poor, for example, will not benefit from higher wages - but will suffer the inflation that comes in tandem, he notes.
This group, who are both old and poor, will continue to grow in what Mr Tharman has said is a unique, local challenge.
Due to Singapore's rapid development, unskilled workers are largely also ageing ones. Of those who did not complete secondary school in the workforce, two- thirds are aged 50 and above.
That Singapore is now on the ageing downswing overall has also made its inequality more visceral, says Dr Tan.
""When you are 20 years old and you see large differences in income around you, it's okay. You're young, you can work harder and achieve that. But when you're 50, it's a different dynamic,"" he notes.
Inequality is a vicious circle of its own. Dr Tan notes that the income inequality of earlier decades has led to a ""wealth gap"" now, where the rich enjoy a steady stream of investment income that the poor do not. This wealth gap ""has an even greater psychological impact because we live so close to one another"", he notes.
National University of Singapore economist Hui Weng Tat points to a perfect storm of high costs of living and high aspirations: ""For a developed economy where educational and aspirational levels of a large proportion of the population are high, and affordability of major essentials such as housing and private transport seems to be slipping away... significant resentment will undoubtedly be focused on the extent of inequality that exists.""
Studies have found other psychological effects of inequality, such as reduced work morale and lower productivity, he notes. ""The disillusionment and disappointment inevitably will be expressed at the polling booths.""
Former chief statistician Paul Cheung says that a new ""social distance"" has emerged in Singapore in the last decade, one which may be unbridgeable.
""In the past, you have HDB blocks next to the rich enclaves. Now you have enclaves that even the middle class can't access, such as Sentosa Cove and other 'high-class' places.""
Dr Cheung, now a social work professor at the National University of Singapore, adds: ""Social class has become more distinct and stratified. This is a serious issue for Singapore as it underpins all political and social changes.""
Tweaking social assistance
DURING the previous term of government, social spending rose from $13 billion in 2006 to $21.5 billion in 2011. Currently, low-income families get $4 in transfers for every $1 they pay in taxes.
But there still exists a wide public consensus that the Government is not redistributing enough, and is too tight-fisted in its social assistance.
A part of this is philosophical. Still evident in its new progressivity is the Government's enduring ideological commitment to self-reliance and aversion to handouts.
Almost all of its major new redistributive schemes are tied to being employed, and it has ploughed resources into early childhood education and adult skills training.
Its ""humanitarian"" assistance - that is, handouts - remains minimal. Public Assistance, given to the elderly with no one to depend on and who cannot work, is $450 a month, after a $50 increment in this year's Budget.
The Lien Foundation's Mr Lien says that the Government can be much less conservative in how it manages its social assistance programmes, like in its use of endowment funds. It uses a percentage of investment returns from the reserves to set up such funds. Then, only a percentage of these funds is spent per year: a ""doubly conservative"" method that ensures that much less is spent on social assistance than is available to be spent, he says.
Mr Tharman has expressed the view that rather than being conservative, this guarantees such social assistance programmes beyond the current term of government - insuring them against the vagaries of populist pressures and economic cycles.
While government transfers have grown in Singapore, this factor brings its Gini coefficient down by only about 6 per cent, from 0.478 before transfers, to 0.459 after. This is a far smaller magnitude than the 30 per cent downward effect that other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries achieve on average, says Prof Hui.
Boosting transfers will help acceptance of income inequality, adds SMU's Prof Hoon. This is because inequality is then seen as a necessary way to generate the fiscal resources needed to subsidise the disadvantaged, he says.
But some People's Action Party (PAP) backbenchers urge the Government to continue to stand firm against the political wind.
""Big and broad transfers might give you a lot of political capital, but where does that take the country in 20 years' time?"" says Moulmein-Kallang GRC MP Edwin Tong. He argues that social assistance needs to be targeted and means-tested, as opposed to blanket handouts.
He says: ""Once you start giving, it's much harder to scale back. Look at what's happening in the West. Why do we think we might be different?""
PAP MP Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) says the Government's expansion of social spending and redistribution may not keep up with growing public expectations because it must distil a general ""call for more"" into sustainable programmes.
In his response to MPs after the Budget debate this year, Mr Tharman emphasised that the Government will not attempt ""progressivity or redistribution for its own sake""; spending better is as important as how much it spends, he added.
""This 'Government must do more' thing is naturally everybody's call,"" says Mr Liang. ""Every Budget debate, MPs call for more, and that's because we see that there are really those who need more. But it's also the Government's job to make sure that when you do more, you're doing something that's responsible and sustainable.""

DON'T KILL THE GOOSE THAT LAYS THE GOLDEN EGG
""Philosophically, I am for taxing more on luxurious consumption. High spenders should be taxed more for discretionary spending on non-essential items. We can increase tax on items like tobacco, alcohol, luxurious cars, speculative property investment.
It is easy to talk about just raising tax for higher-income earners for redistribution to assist welfare programmes. But altering the tax structure may adversely affect Singapore's attractiveness as a meritocracy and talent-driven state. Look what happened to France and the United Kingdom.
It is also difficult for the Government to demonstrate how such increases will be fairly distributed and managed.Don't discourage inflow and retention of human capital, which Singapore relies so heavily on. We have done well so far. Don't kill the goose that lays the golden egg.""

LET THE PEOPLE CHOOSE HOW TO GIVE BACK
""Someone who has worked hard for his or her money would want to choose how to give back to society - and so would his descendants - so I think that a more creative tax structure that promotes constructive philanthropy and capacity-building is preferable to just letting the state decide how the money is spent.
I'm not against raising income taxes or estate taxes, but it is a blunt instrument. People will find ways around it, or go offshore, which defeats the whole purpose.
I think the carrot is better than the stick. There is more prestige in giving to a good cause that you choose rather than flashing expensive cars, and I think society can mature to this point. Left to choose, people may give more than what they are taxed.
We should want to make it such that they do it voluntarily and get enjoyment out of it, rather than have it be a punitive, regulatory thing.""

PHILANTHROPY VERY MUCH A PERSONAL THING
""There is no need to raise taxes on top income bracket earners as most, at least those I know, already contribute in many ways on their own to society. I strongly believe that I owe my business success to my family and the community at large. Hence, I have been contributing actively and generously to several sectors like education, sports and the arts. My monetary and service contributions have had a great impact in sculpting Singapore's development, and nurturing the next generation of leaders.
I fully support the Government's efforts to raise more funds for social spending, and as businessmen, we are happy to work with theGovernment on some of these initiatives. Philanthropy is very much a personal thing - so I think there is no need for the Government to resort to higher taxes to raise funds for such social spending.""

FIRST ASK IF ALTERNATIVE SOURCES SHOULD BE TAPPED
""I am not opposed to increasing taxes on the wealthy to narrow the income gap, and I do not think this would necessarily reduce Singapore's competitiveness or attractiveness to foreigners, if the increases are small and well thought-out. The exorbitant tax on cars has not deterred foreigners. Capital gains and inheritance taxes are, however, important to the wealthy and to investors and this should not be touched. Besides personal income and consumption taxes, an increase in property taxes for those in truly luxurious homes, such as good-class bungalows, would be fair.
Philosophically, I would agree to pay higher taxes to help the needy. But I would first ask whether alternative sources should be utilised. The reserves are one sacred cow which should be re-examined.There needs to be a national conversation as to how much of annual income from them should be used for long-term social or infrastructural projects.""

","   FORMER Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is one of those tasked with campaigning for the Barisan Nasional slate in Johor, has reached for an old playbook in order to drum up support - by hitting out at Singapore.
In a blog posting on Thursday, he accused the opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP) of wanting to end the traditional Malay-Chinese cooperation in Malaysia.
This concord, he said, is premised on the kongsi, or sharing, principle of ""not taking all our entitlements for ourselves but sacrificing some so others may get their share"".
Instead, the DAP wants to implement meritocracy, which he said the ruling People's Action Party in Singapore champions and is ""about the winners taking all"".
""The meritocracy promoted by the DAP will mean diminishing opportunities for the Malays in education and in business,"" he said. ""This will result in the Malays becoming less and less qualified and poorer.""
He went on to say that if DAP leader Lim Kit Siang wins Gelang Patah, a closely watched seat in Johor, an ""unhealthy racial confrontation"" will be the result.
Tun Dr Mahathir also voiced a similar theme during a speech last Saturday to rally support for the BN in Selangor.
""DAP uses the PAP way. When PAP was in Malaysia, it used the slogan 'Malaysian Malaysia'. It said Malays took everything, others nothing. Is that true?"" he said. ""We see that other races have wealth.
""There are hundreds of millionaires among them today.""
He added that while Singapore closed Chinese vernacular schools, Malaysia allowed them, although most of its leaders are Malay.
This shows the government's ""fairness"", which contrasts with the ""racism of DAP"".
At recent Umno rallies in Johor, the state closest to Singapore, speakers alleged that Malay Singaporeans had been marginalised, and warned local Malays of a similar fate if they voted opposition.
Opposition Pakatan Rakyat leaders have also made oblique attacks on the Republic, blaming BN for letting foreigners drive up property prices, particularly in Iskandar Malaysia.
In an anti-opposition flyer that has been circulated widely on social media, a former Malay staff member of DAP secretary-general and Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng claimed the latter had frequently visited Singapore to meet former Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, staff from the Israeli embassy, and priests.
The flyer claims the DAP wants to unite with the PAP and make Christianity Malaysia's official religion.
""If Pakatan wins GE13, Malays will lose power forever,"" it added.

This is not the first time he has criticised Singapore to rally poll support for his party, and I hope it will not jeopardise the excellent bilateral relations between Singapore and Malaysia.
As a Malay Singaporean, I refute the allegations made by Tun Dr Mahathir that the Malays here have been marginalised.
Our Government practises meritocracy. Malay Singaporeans, along with the other races, have enjoyed good education, housing, career and business opportunities since our independence.
Malays here have made significant progress and there are many success stories among them, including prominent businessmen, tertiary graduates and executives in the professional, manager and executive sector.
We have had several Malay-Muslim ministers, a former president and high-ranking civil servants; our current Speaker of Parliament is Madam Halimah Yacob.
With the opportunities, assistance and support given by the Government, the Malay-Muslim community in Singapore will continue to progress.

","   HOW you did in school at age 18 should not define your life, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam firmly believes.
This is why his vision for Singapore in 20 years is for it to become a society where people treat each other as equals, regardless of their education or job.
What matters is not which school one went to, or how one did at 18. What should matter is whether everyone has the opportunity to continually improve and upgrade his lot in life, whatever his starting point.
As the country mulls over the kind of society it wants to be, it has to look beyond just raising wages, or what kind of tax policy to have. ""It's about changing the way we think about responsibility to society... It's also recognising the role that everyone plays in keeping the society going.""
While he has spoken on meritocracy before, this time Mr Tharman sketched out in detail his views in an interview with The Straits Times.
He was responding to a question on what kind of Singapore he hoped for his four children in the next 20 years, when they will be aged between 37 and 42. The question was chosen online by readers of the ST current affairs website Singapolitics as the fifth most popular out of 20 possible questions for him to answer.
""We've had a working meritocracy. It has brought us quite far. It's allowed for a tremendous amount of social mobility in our first 40 years, but I think it has to evolve,"" he said.
""We've got to be a broader meritocracy recognising different strengths and different individuals, but also a continuous meritocracy where it doesn't matter so much what happened when you're in Sec 4 or JC 2 or when you finish your polytechnic or ITE (course), but what happens after that."" It is not just education, he added, but also the way ordinary workers are treated whether in a restaurant or on a bus.
While significant changes to improve this have already been made in the last decade, he said, more is still needed.
""We are a meritocracy that's still a bit too much defined by what happened in your school years or your post-secondary years.""
Mr Tharman, a former education minister, observed that the education system has created two groups of students.
One group know their strengths, but are not ""sufficiently aware of their weaknesses, and not sufficiently aware of the strengths of others"".
The other group have not done as well in school and are ""very aware of what they didn't achieve, but not enough of them have discovered their strengths"".
There has to be more mixing among people of different backgrounds, he said, and people have to be given opportunities to continually develop their skills and talents, or what he calls mastery.
""That's the only way in which, over time, quietly, without realising it, you recognise the strengths of others and you also know your weaknesses.""
Singapore is the way it is, he explained, as a result of a combination of the British and Chinese approaches to education - the British system is ""quite an elitist system"", while Chinese education culture is ""quite test-oriented"".
Going forward, as Singaporeans think about the society they want, he hopes they will ask the fundamental question of ""how we view fellow Singaporeans"".
""Do you view them as equals? Do you do things together? That has to start from a young age and it has to continue through life.""

","   Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam gave a wide-ranging interview on topics such as politics and the economy to The Straits Times last week for its current affairs website Singapolitics. Here is an excerpt:
The Straits Times: In your view, what is the biggest economic challenge facing Singapore over the next 10 years? And what must Singapore and Singaporeans do to face that?
DPM Tharman: The advanced economies are going through a rough period. The United States is showing some improvement but the long-term challenges are very significant, particularly because of its fiscal problems. Europe is in a much tougher condition and it's not going to get out of its current problems quickly. Japan is now trying a new approach but the situation is essentially quite similar to Europe - an ageing society, debts that have mounted up and a fiscal strategy that can't last for long because someone has to pay for the older generation and they're going to find it very difficult to raise taxes on the scale required.
So these are advanced societies, still very rich markets for us, wealthy markets. We shouldn't take our eye off them as markets.
So stay plugged in to the US, Europe and Japan because they are very valuable markets for sophisticated products, especially in manufacturing as well as in services. Sophisticated demand is very importantly generated by the most advanced markets.
But the growth isn't going to be very significant from that source. So we've got to increasingly look at the middle and even the bottom of the pyramid, the emerging countries where growth is still significant, a middle class is emerging, becoming more sophisticated.
Tremendous opportunity for us. And it means that not just our large companies but our SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have to be outward-oriented.
In fact, quite impressively, a significant proportion of our SMEs are now deriving more than half their revenue from abroad. Compared to 10 years ago, many more are now abroad in some way, exploiting opportunities in the markets around us.
But it also means that our whole orientation, starting from young through education, and in the workforce, has to be to look outwards for opportunities, and not just in the advanced countries, or English-speaking countries, but the countries around us.
We've got to have that cultural flexibility of being able to work and operate in these environments because there are plenty of opportunities for Singaporeans. We have to make it easier in terms of their children's education, so that when they come back, they can fit into our system easily.When you first entered politics in 2001, you said that the biggest challenge for the PAP is to win the hearts of young people. How do you think the PAP has performed in that regard?
Well, I think the first challenge the PAP faces is the fact that it's the incumbent. People want a check on the PAP. And that's natural. It's just human psychology. So that's the first disadvantage you face in terms of human psychology. And you have to accept that.
Second, and this is an important point, all over the world, the economies that are more advanced, and that includes in the Asian context, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, they're finding it more difficult to get the improvements in the quality of life seen in the past.
First, because of course in Asia we've caught up and we're at a higher standard of living. Second, global competition has changed. The pressures at the middle end of the workforce have increased internationally. So you find that in the US, for instance, the median American has a lower real income now than 10 years ago, in fact 15 years ago.
You find that in Europe as well. The average person has not seen his life improve. You find it in places like Taiwan. The average person has not seen his life improve.
In Singapore we've at least been able to achieve a significant improvement in the standard of living of the average person. Any young person can find a job very quickly, in fact faster than anywhere else in Asia. Find a good job very quickly. ITE grad, polytechnic grad, university grad. Any person can see improvement on the job and over time see his pay going up. That's something which we've got to work very hard to preserve.
So economic policy is not irrelevant to the type of society we want because we are a society that still has aspirations to move up. People, families do want to move up. They want their children to do better than the parents. And economic strategy is not irrelevant to that.
But capturing the hearts of the young is also about catering to diversity.
Very importantly, the PAP can play the role of galvanising views or being a generator of views, encouraging people to come up with ideas, alternative ideas on a whole range of strategies - our social strategies, how we can help the elderly, our transport strategies, our housing strategies. Bring up views from all quarters of society. Take them seriously. Help the thinking process take place on the part of citizens. That's a very important role that we can play as well.
And you can see that the PAP today is quite different from five years ago, and almost unrecognisable compared to 20 years ago. A very different party. Still a lot of work to do.
So I think getting the hearts of the young and being close to the young is about, first, never ignoring the fact that policies are important, and making sure we're an economy that provides good jobs for the young and that they will be able to see improvement in the course of their working lives. It's important.
But, second, it's also about not just tolerance of diversity but being welcoming of diversity and going out there to get it, to actually generate alternative views.What do you think is a tolerable threshold of opposition the PAP can live with?
I don't have a number in my mind but we have to accept that part of a healthy political system is one with a decent opposition presence in Parliament and outside and a responsible opposition will, I think, be able to contribute to Singapore.Do you think you'll be able to persuade the vast majority of voters, especially young voters, that the PAP can be dominant without being dominating?
Yes. If we continue along the path that we've taken in recent years and which you can see our younger ministers very actively pursuing, creating new fora, new ways in which people can be part of the thinking process for Singapore, can express their preferences particularly on values, on identity and also on policy. If we continue along that path and if we can continue to involve people and help them take responsibility collectively for making a better Singapore, I think we can retain our anchor role in Singapore society.In 20 years' time, your children will be aged between 37 and 42. What kind of Singapore do you hope for them?
Well, I hope it'll be a Singapore where we treat each other as equals, which is I think a different type of meritocracy. We've had a working meritocracy, it has brought us quite far, it's allowed for a tremendous amount of social mobility in our first 40 years but I think it has to evolve.
It starts from young. I think we have students who go through our education system, those who are doing well, who are very aware of their strengths and achievements but not sufficiently aware of their weaknesses and not sufficiently aware of the strengths of others. That's one group.
We have another group that goes through the system very aware of their weaknesses so that, you know, they got into a certain stream or didn't get into a school of choice, they're very aware of what they didn't achieve but not enough of them have discovered their strengths. And I believe very strongly that everyone has a strength.
Very few people are strong in everything and very few people are weak in everything. Everyone has a strength. So how do we evolve our system to keep it meritocratic but broaden it, make it more flexible and very importantly allow for more mixing?
There's nothing like mixing where, as part of your day-to-day activity, what you go through from primary school through to Secondary 4, you interact with people who are different from you. That's the only way in which, over time, quietly, without realising it, you recognise the strengths of others and you also know your weaknesses. So I think that's a society I would like to see.
We are moving in that direction, we've made significant changes in the last decade but I think there are still more changes required. It's not just education, it's the way we treat blue-collar workers generally, ordinary workers whether it's in restaurants or when you're taking transport, everywhere. We are still a little too much of a hierarchy based on what happened to you at age 18, what scores you had, what qualifications you had, which course you could go to. So we are a meritocracy that's still a bit too much defined by what happened in your school years or your post-secondary years.
There are some societies which are not meritocratic enough in the school system. I mean the US is a good example, public schools in very bad shape, giving a very bad deal to ordinary kids and then they've got private schools that are very well endowed, providing a very high quality of education, not meritocratic and they have bad outcomes for average folk.
But there's something about their workplace culture that I think we can learn from, both in the US and in Europe where they are very respectful of people in different vocations. They treat each other a little more as equals and I think that's a very important culture to have and they rarely look at what happened to you 20 years ago. It's always about continual improvement or what I call a continuous meritocracy.
So we've got to be a broader meritocracy, recognising different strengths and different individuals but also a continuous meritocracy where it doesn't matter so much what happened when you were in Sec 4 or JC 2 or when you finished your poly or ITE, but what happens after that.
Are you continually improving, are you developing mastery? Regardless of where you start, we have to recognise what you have achieved to develop mastery in what you are doing.People have described Budget 2013, which you presented recently, as a Robin Hood Budget. There are some concerns that perhaps now the Government is leaning too much towards the socialist stance and there is concern about welfarism. What are your views on these comments?
Well, first, I don't think we have become, and will become, populist in the sense of doing things for short-term electoral gains. We will not do that.
Second, have we shifted to the left? Yes, we have. If I compare our thinking in Cabinet, or the weight of thinking in Cabinet, when I first entered politics about 11 years ago, I would say it was centrist but there were two flanks on either side of it. There were some who were a little right-of-centre, and there were some a little left-of-centre.
Now, I would say the weight of thinking is left-of-centre. You still get diversity of views in Cabinet but the centre of gravity is left of centre. And that means the current team is very clearly focused on upgrading the lives, improving the lives of lower-income Singaporeans and of our older folk.
Those are two very important social objectives and we're going to succeed. We're going to do something to improve life for these two very important groups of Singaporeans.
Middle-income Singaporeans, compared to the rest of the world, I think we've done quite well. The fact that the median earner has seen a significant increase in real wages after knocking off inflation is something that few other societies in our position have achieved in the last five years and the last 10 years.
So, keeping an economy competitive is also very much on our minds. It's not because we are, you know, always looking at economic issues or looking at GDP (gross domestic product) and so on. It's got nothing to do with that. It's got to do with Singaporeans. If you want to help the majority and you want to help the middle-income earner, there's no other way other than having an economy that's competitive, that's able to create good jobs where businesses are able to run a profit and are able to share gains with workers.
And that's something that Singaporeans want because the average Singaporean does not want to coast along at the present standard of living. They do want further improvement and they want their children especially to have a better life than them.
And I think that optimism is a great part of Singapore. The fact that we are still an optimistic society and expect our children to do better than us, I think it's a very important part of Singapore and we shouldn't lose that.
So, it is a pragmatic, left-of-centre government, focused especially on those who need help the most - which is the low-income group and the elderly - but it has to make sure that we keep this ship moving in what can be quite rough seas because that's what will determine the lives of the majority, including the middle-income group. Make sure that we stay competitive.

I don't have a number in my mind but we have to accept that part of a healthy political system is one with a decent opposition presence in Parliament and outside and a responsible opposition will, I think, be able to contribute to Singapore.
On the kind of Singapore he hopes for his children in 20 years' time
Well, I hope it'll be a Singapore where we treat each other as equals, which is I think a different type of meritocracy. We've had a working meritocracy, it has brought us quite far, it's allowed for a tremendous amount of social mobility in our first 40 years but I think it has to evolve.

","   There's a new vision and definition of meritocracy in Singapore, and they have a wonderful ring to them.
When something as refreshing and with the potential to change comes our way, we should do more to herald its arrival.
But, seriously, when Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam spoke to this newspaper recently, it was his vision for Singapore and his view on meritocracy that stood out for me.
Here's what he said which was published last Friday and is worth quoting at length:
""We've had a working meritocracy. It has brought us quite far. It's allowed for a tremendous amount of social mobility in our first 40 years, but I think it has to evolve.
""We've got to be a broader meritocracy recognising different strengths and different individuals, but also a continuous meritocracy where it doesn't matter so much what happened when you're in Sec 4 or JC 2 or when you finish your polytechnic or ITE (course), but what happens after that.""
It is not just education, he added, but also the way ordinary workers are treated whether in a restaurant or on a bus.
""We are a meritocracy that's still a bit too much defined by what happened in your school years or your post-secondary years.""
His vision of Singapore? To become a society where people treat one another as equals, regardless of their education level or job.
That's a tall order, especially since, as he pointed out, Singapore is a product of both the British system of education which is quite elitist (think Eton and Oxbridge) and the Chinese system which is very ""test-oriented"" (think the imperial examination system).
Can Singapore change this dose of double-strength DNA?
The realistic answer is that it will take a heroic effort on everybody's part, and even then, the outcome isn't assured.
But, it's important to understand why a society, in which everybody believes he or she is as equal as anyone else and treated as such, is better than one which is overly hierarchical and with widening social gaps.
First, there is tremendous wastage whenever people believe they are less equal because they will not make the maximum effort and live up to their potential.
Many of us who travel can see, for example, how motivated and productive waiters in Western Europe are, with just one or two serving an entire restaurant.
The same is true of construction workers, in Japan, Australia and other mature economies.
Their societies are much more egalitarian than Singapore, where waiting at tables isn't seen as such a demeaning job and waiters, or for that matter, bus drivers and construction workers, are treated with greater respect.
When they are treated well, they are more likely to give of their best.
This is a key reason for the low productivity of Singapore workers which no amount of government incentives can help.
But more important than work is how an unequal society divides the country politically and socially.
Singapore is moving in this direction because it wants to be a First World global city with all the attendant glamour and glitz but which the HDB heartlander finds hard to identify or keep up with.
This widening gap will create political problems because the leaders cannot move the country in one direction when the people do not have a common vision of what the future holds for them.
How then to realise Mr Tharman's vision?
Singapore needs to change in three areas.
First, and most obvious is the education system which needs to be made more multi-dimensional and rounded so that a student's entire life doesn't depend on how well he does at the PSLE or the O and A-level examinations.
It is an encouraging sign that changes are afoot in this direction and education is a key focus of the ongoing Our Singapore Conversation headed by Education Minister Heng Swee Keat.
I do not envy his task because it is a complex issue and students and parents have different expectations of what a good education is about.
Even on a relatively simple question about whether to retain, abolish or tweak the PSLE, there will be no consensus.
But if Mr Tharman's vision is to be realised, there is one critical change that needs to be made to the way pupils are assigned their schools after PSLE.
There should be a greater mix of students with differing academic abilities in every school, including the so-called elite ones.
When this happens and there is less differentiation among schools here, there will be less pressure to do well in those life-defining examinations.
Then students and teachers can focus more on learning and be more open to developing other skills besides doing well in examinations.
Without this change, no amount of tinkering with the PSLE will mean much.
The second area of change has to be in the way we value what people do to earn a living.
We can say all we want about how we should treat people equally regardless of the jobs they do but if we pay a cleaner at a hawker centre only $800 a month, it is an empty promise.
This has nothing to do with how productive the cleaner is, which is a favourite retort.
It has everything to do with our values as a society and how we want to treat our fellow Singaporeans.
Our instinct as a society when we see such low wages being paid must be to say without a moment's hesitation: This isn't right and we should put a stop to it.
We shouldn't require an economist or productivity expert to tell us that.
Raising wages at the low end must be a top priority in this exercise because, like it or not, pay does affect a person's self-worth.
Finally, Singapore has to develop a stronger sense of community, that we are in this together and need to look after one another.
This is a defining characteristic of those societies that approximate Mr Tharman's vision - Japan, Israel, and the Scandinavian countries where there is much greater respect for everyone regardless of the jobs they do.
In fact, they have an easier task because of their homogeneous population with one language and culture.
For Singapore, it means having a more vigorous civic society where people take responsibility for their actions and causes, and, in so doing, forge a stronger sense of ownership of their community.
Is this an impossible dream for Singapore?
Perhaps, but a vision for the future is a good place to start.
We could begin with being smarter about the meritocracy we practise.

"," Dialects
","   THE repeated refrain that Singapore is small and fragile, with no natural resources of its own, has become the stuff of ""nation-building myth"", according to some participants at an Our Singapore Conversation session yesterday.
And harping on it would curb Singaporeans' imagination and ability to think big and out of the box, they pointed out.
Similarly with meritocracy, which has contributed significantly to Singapore's progress.
But it is time to move the definition of merit away from academic achievements.
These were among the suggestions from about 30 people at the session, organised by Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao, as they called for a thorough rethink of the ""sacred cows"" in Singapore's approach to development. As one participant put it: ""Behind these sacred cows are many nation-building myths which may need to be relooked... What's behind the sacred cows and why did they become sacred?""
Responding to their concerns as he wrapped up the three-hour session, Education Minister Heng Swee Keat stressed the need for Singaporeans to be clear about the realities that could not be changed. He noted that even as Singapore faces the reality of being small, its size has not been portrayed as a restriction in recent years.
""In many ways, we have been able to surpass being small,"" said Mr Heng. ""What we have to think about next is how to continue surpassing our size.""
However, he cautioned that people should be clear-eyed about Singapore's advantages and disadvantages and not be too inward-looking. For instance, Singapore's destiny cannot be decoupled from the global economy, which is becoming more complex and unstable, and from changes in technology.
The participants also called for greater transparency and freedom of information, including access to history archives, to boost citizens' trust in the Government.
On meritocracy, the subject of much discussion lately, Mr Heng said he agreed with Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who had called for a broader and more continuous meritocracy.
Said Mr Heng: ""Our life journey is a fairly long one and at different stages, we need to be prepared to recognise everyone for his intrinsic worth and help everyone achieve his best.""
He stressed the importance of continual learning and laying the foundation for lifelong learning in students as ""one key area that we will work on"".
Several participants, who were Zaobao readers ranging in age from 20 to 47, also asked for a relaxation of the rules on the use of Chinese dialects in media.
They also said the utilitarian approach to teaching Chinese would strip away the beauty of the language.
Mr Heng noted that the gradual decrease in dialect speakers can be seen even in Chinese cities like Shanghai.
Singapore already has a ""complicated language environment"" with its current focus on English and the mother tongue ""first and foremost"", he said.
Those keen to learn dialects can do so at a later age, he added.
Zaobao editor Goh Sin Teck said a younger group of bilingual readers were specially invited as their views would add value to the national conversation. For instance, they feel more strongly about language and the humanities, he added.

","   Singapore should become acontinuous meritocracy, said Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in a recent interview. Elgin Toh explores what it means and what it would taketomake that transition.
TWENTY-NINE-YEAR-OLD Lionel Louis readily agrees it was an isolated incident. But it grated all the same.
Shortly after starting his dream career in the civil service, he was bypassed for an assignment he believed he was well-equipped to undertake.
Did it have anything to do with his background as a former Normal (Technical) and ITE student, he wondered at the time. Many of his peers had gone through the more conventional junior college-university route.
""I have to emphasise that I've been treated very fairly on the whole,"" said Mr Louis, now in his third year in the service, and who has a degree from Curtin University.
""But in that instance, there may have been an assumption that the task shouldn't be assigned to somebody who was not of a certain background.""
He added: ""It reminded me that I had to work harder to prove such assumptions wrong.""
Incidents like this - possible workplace bias over what school you went to - are, by nature, exceedingly difficult to prove.
If they are true and, indeed, widespread, they raise questions about whether Singapore can claim that its meritocratic system, built up over decades, is in good working order.
After all, if the assessment of merit and ability is frozen at a certain age, where are the incentive and the opportunity to better your lot?
In an interview with The Straits Times earlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam alluded to such doubts when he said the present meritocratic system needed to ""evolve"".
""We've got to be a continuous meritocracy where it doesn't matter so much what happened when you were in Sec 4 or JC 2 or when you finished your poly or ITE, but what happens after that,"" he said.
""Regardless of where you start we have to recognise what you have achieved to develop mastery in what you are doing.""
To what extent has Singapore's meritocracy become ""discontinuous""? Why and how did it happen? And what steps can be taken to confront the apparent ailment?
Insight spoke to observers and analysts for some answers.
Education system
HISTORY gives one key explanation for Singapore's particular brand of meritocracy that tends to make judgments about individuals at a fairly young age, revising them only incrementally as the years go by.
Mr Tharman said that as a young nation, Singapore inherited the British and Chinese education systems, each of which was academically oriented and elitist.
Those who look at more recent history, such as Non-Constituency MP Yee Jenn Jong, recall the Goh Keng Swee report on education in 1979, which lamented the high dropout rates and other inefficiencies. This led to the introduction of streaming, which ""sorted people out like in a production factory"".
""Singapore was trying to attract multinational corporations and you had to fill up the employment fast,"" said Mr Yee, who added that this strategy has since become outmoded in today's innovation-driven era.
Human tendencies perpetuate the model, said Mr Donald Low of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP), who studies behavioural economics.
Employers often rely on academic results as a convenient proxy for ability because gathering more information is costly. Furthermore, once they label somebody as ""good"", the label tends to stick, which economists call the ""halo effect"".
Then, there is the cost of turnover. He said: ""After going through so much effort searching and training the employee, if he turns out slightly short of the mark, you are better off just hanging on to him.""
Over time, it seems, the risk has grown that the initial advantages and disadvantages a person sets out with could be affecting outcomes for longer than is healthy.
In a globalised and fast-changing world, the effects of not being continuously meritocratic go beyond unfairness. They also bring about inefficiency in a number of ways.
Ms Wong Su-Yen, Asean managing director of human resource company Mercer, cited work by Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner showing there are nine forms of intelligence. These are not easily captured by exams, which tend to focus on logical and linguistic intelligence.
""And just because something is easy to measure doesn't mean it's the right measure for that particular job,"" she added.
Nominated MP Laurence Lien believes traditional notions of meritocracy do not take into account the importance of diversity.
""Employers often end up with staff who are too similar and who produce too much common thinking, which can be a serious impediment when dealing with complex challenges,"" he said.
The consensus is that much of the private sector, being exposed to free market competition, has faced less of a problem curbing such a tendency.
""If you don't hire someone who is good simply because he doesn't have a degree, he is going to join your competitor and compete against you,"" said Mr Soon Sze-Meng, a director in a multinational corporation.
The extent of the problem in the public sector, however, is controversial.
Mr Low, formerly a member of the elite Administrative Service, for instance, claims success came more easily to those on the scheme, as well as those on government scholarships.
""More opportunities are created for them. I've seen instances when a scholar didn't perform and was given a bad evaluation, only for someone higher up to ask, 'How can that be?'""
Mr Soon, however, said one cannot conclude from the data that a static meritocracy prevailed in the civil service.
In 2010, four out of 27 permanent secretaries were non-scholars, he noted. Last year, six in 10 statutory board CEOs did not hail from the Administrative Service.
Barriers
WHILE the most obvious barrier to continuous meritocracy may appear to be employers, since they are the ones making hiring and promotion decisions, observers say they are seldom as insidious as the more improbable impediment - the employee or job seeker himself.
Ms Gog Soon Joo, executive director of the Institute for Adult Learning, which is part of the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA), classifies them under three categories: informational, situational and dispositional.
The first simply refers to people not knowing about opportunities to upskill and so climb the economic ladder.
WDA has set up dozens of centres around the island to publicise its wide range of training courses - from aerospace to environmental cleaning - and job counselling services. It also holds roadshows in housing estates and distributes pamphlets to homes.
""We have a lot of good jobs and a shortage of labour. It's a matter of whether people know about them. A particular area may be crying out: I need nurses, I need nursing aides. These are better jobs. There are progression pathways,"" she said.
The second barrier refers to a situation a worker finds himself in.
Consider a low-wage worker stuck in a dead-end job who would not mind doing a training course that might open doors to a more promising career. But this would involve forgoing overtime work and the extra cash it brings, which might just outweigh the desire to upgrade.
Dispositional barriers - or those related to the employees' beliefs and outlook - are the toughest to overcome. Someone who has absorbed a certain message about himself or about the world can, quite often, become immovable.
A risk-averse employee might resist a change in job role recommended by his employer - even though that could work in favour of his personal development, noted Ms Wong.
Quite often, these barriers begin forming when someone is still in school - which explains Mr Tharman's repeated reference to schools in his comments.
He said: ""We have students who go through our education system, those who are doing well, who are very aware of their strengths... We have another group that goes through the system very aware of their weaknesses... They got into a certain stream or didn't get into a school of choice.""
Dr Jason Tan of the National Institute of Education (NIE) notes how the former group tends to get a puffed-up sense of self-importance, while the latter group develops low expectations and a feeling of helplessness. This potentially plagues them for life and dampens the will to strive.
One group that reaches out to such students is the Children-at-Risk Empowerment Association (Care). It has been holding classes and events for secondary school students in the Normal (Technical) stream since 1997.
Executive director John Tan said: ""Everyone is good at something. He just has to discover it. We believe in the students and we help them believe in themselves.""
Some of his students have gone on to become entrepreneurs, civil servants and factory supervisors.
Of course, actual success is the best antidote to feelings of trepidation and negativity, but, as WDA's Ms Gog discovered, even this could be a very gradual process.
A senior vice-president of a local bank once confided in her her phobia of showing others her resume. She was an N-level student.
Mr Tharman, who has been education minister, has called for some mixing of students ""from primary school through to Sec 4"".
But some analysts believe the solution has to be egalitarian schools - where students are not so clearly segregated into the strong and the weak, as they currently are.
The Finnish school system is often cited as equality in education that works. Students attend a school near their homes and for years do not get numerical grades.
NIE's Dr Jason Tan said that when streaming was first banned in Finland in the 1970s, the teachers' union protested that disparities in student calibre would make their jobs impossibly difficult.
""But those fears have proven to be unfounded. Finnish students routinely come in first in international tests,"" he said.
Mr Yee, who also supports a move in the Finnish direction, wants the Government to set up similar pilot schools for parents like himself who do not mind extracting their children from ""the rat race"".
But Ms Gog, also a parent, prefers the Singapore system, which allows the slow learner to learn at a slower pace. She also cited Singapore's low unemployment rate and high employment rate - ""the envy of many countries"".
Another radical set of educational reforms mooted, this time by Singapore Management University (SMU) president Ho Kwon Ping, to counter the lack of continuous meritocracy, is a credit-based system for all secondary schools, coupled with a much more diverse set of subjects on offer, modelled on the American system.
This would allow students to pick disciplines they are strong in and earn credits for them.
""If I happen to be more bookish and you're more playful and creative, under the current narrow system, bingo, I do better than you, I'm on an upward trajectory and you're going downwards,"" he said.
Whichever set of reforms Singapore finally embarks on, Mr Tharman has said he hopes to see a different society emerging - one in which people show more respect for one another, regardless of occupation.
It is not yet clear, though, how this ideal state would emerge.
One view - Mr Soon's - is that societal respect currently lacking for certain jobs will come only when these low-skilled jobs gradually become skilled ones. This can happen only when the foreign worker population is moderated, leading to a natural rise in productivity, he reckoned.
LKYSPP's Mr Low, on the other hand, believes Singaporeans' lack of respect for blue-collar jobs in general is cultural - and therefore much harder to change.
Said PAP MP Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah): ""DPM Tharman has painted an inspiring picture of what society can and should be.
""And we may not know when this can be achieved, but to me, what's important is for Singaporeans to strive towards it in our everyday lives, by showing a little respect and kindness to those around you, to your neighbours at the lifts, to the servers at coffee shops, to the bus captains we meet and so on.""
Right direction
TO BE sure, Mr Tharman's comments have attracted some scepticism.
Mr Yee wondered ""how many of his Cabinet colleagues agree with him"".
But Mr Liang said the DPM's comments are only the latest in a series beginning with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's speech at the opening of Parliament in 2011, in which he pledged to fight social stratification.
Others, like Mr Low, see Mr Tharman's words as an attempt to improve Singapore's meritocracy without addressing fundamental objections to it.
He sees meritocracy on its own as a ""limited notion of justice and fairness"" and it should therefore be complemented by a ""high amount of state support for those of lesser ability"" - which in turn is contentious.
Still, most people, including Mr Low, agree that the latest comments represent a step in the right direction.
Even Mr Yee, who is from the Workers' Party, said he agreed completely with Mr Tharman's call for a more continuous meritocracy.
Added SMU's Mr Ho: ""The things he said were long overdue.""

","   A friend who has always been critical of the Government texted me one morning to say he wanted to head down to Hong Lim Park on Labour Day.
I assumed he was going to that afternoon's Population White Paper protest. Talk about stereotyping. He actually wanted to take his children to the much more innocuous morning event put together by a group of young people under the banner of Stand Up For Singapore.
The spirit of the two events could not have been more different. One was all sweetness and light, about the joys of being in this country, while the afternoon protest focused on its dark side, with speeches on injustices faced by workers and the tribulations of the stay-at-home mum. The first was about counting blessings; the second catalogued the costs of living in a competitive capitalist society.
Which one was a truer representation of Singapore? Opinions differ, but there is clearly a hunger for a new narrative that Singaporeans can believe in.
One heartening attempt to meet this desire was Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam's call for a ""continuous meritocracy"". In a recent interview with this newspaper, he shared his hope for a culture of respecting every individual for the work he or she does, and regardless of one's background.
""Respect mastery in every job, respect hard work in every job - that has to be our culture,"" he said. ""Regardless of where you start, we have to recognise what you have achieved to develop mastery in what you are doing.""
Mr Tharman expressed his belief in a society of equals: ""Very few people are strong in everything and very few people are weak in everything. Everyone has a strength.""
His comments were a timely reminder that even as officials like him try to reform policies to create the conditions for the kind of Singapore that people want, ordinary citizens' attitudes can also play a role. In this crowded, competitive and sometimes bruising city, is there more that Singaporeans can do to soften its hard edges and make life more civilised?
Regardless of political affiliation, few would argue with the vision of a country where the young possess hope, the old have dignity and the poor feel valued. How do we get there? I checked in on a couple of Singaporeans who know these groups well.
One is Mr Dominic Lim, a 26-year-old who runs Splat!, a non-profit volunteer group for youth at risk and has counselled youths from all backgrounds. Mr Lim was an infectious bundle of energy as he spoke eloquently about what such a vision could do for youths. One problem for his charges is that they are reluctant to claim the aspirations they have and suffer ""aspirational poverty"", because they fear that society will not recognise their goals as worthy.
He cites the story of a boy from the Normal (Technical) stream who will be starting a car workshop after his national service. ""At Chinese New Year, all his relatives kept asking, 'Boy, why you want to be car mechanic, why don't you want to make money to drive your own car?'""
The boy persisted and his father finally gave up on trying to change his mind. To Mr Lim, this is a key problem in society: ""We pigeon- hole the definition of success. We pigeon-hole aspirations, when what we should be doing is to broaden what success means.""
Behind such attitudes is a vicious circle: People treat service workers poorly, who then find it hard to take pride in their work.
I also spoke to Mrs Rachel Lee, a social worker of more than 20 years who works at the Fei Yue Family Service Centre. I caught her at the end of a long hard day, and still, she sounded sweet and patient. She has a simple wish: She wants more Singaporeans to understand that poverty is real so they will unlock their empathy.
Poverty is not easy to spot in Singapore, she says. ""So the middle and upper classes may not have a clear understanding of what it means to raise a family and feed five children on an income of $1,500 a month. Their social circles are different.""
Like many others I know, Mrs Lee does not think Singaporeans lack care or concern; but many do not know how to express it. So, her family service centre is about to start a programme to allow better- off families to ""share their resources"" with the disadvantaged through simple acts - for example, by sharing tuition time, or getting the better-off child to give his toys to the poorer one or saving up to buy him one.
It is not just about showing charity, but striking a connection. Mrs Lee hopes that along the way, there can be respect. The poor are not helpless or hopeless, she says. ""Even though he may be a blue- collar worker because he did not do well in school and is now not a high-earner, it does not mean he is not resilient,"" she says.
She cites the case of a woman in her 40s who gave birth to a fifth child who turned out to have special needs. Her husband died soon after. The other four children were all still in primary school. A decade on, the children are all on track for a better life. The eldest has graduated from a polytechnic, the second is about to get a sales job, and the others are in secondary school.
""Despite all she faced, she is a good mother. All her children have been taught the right values of being self-reliant, thrifty and resilient in the face of adversity. They didn't have a lot of toys or clothes growing up but they made it,"" says Mrs Lee.
Now and in the coming years, one of the most heated political debates in the country will be how much the People's Action Party Government - as opposed to irresistible forces of globalisation - is to blame for those who are struggling, including the sandwiched class, and whether it is doing enough to help. How this debate is resolved will shape the outcome of the next general election.
But away from politics, there is also the question of people's own attitudes. Surely, how we treat the people around us need not be contingent on where we stand politically. Whether one is content or displeased with the Government, it should not blind us to the fact that we can do more as individuals to create a more civilised city - where a person's desire for dignity is not hindered by those who ""are very aware of their strengths and achievements but not sufficiently aware of their weaknesses and not sufficiently aware of the strengths of others"", to quote Mr Tharman.
The first step, as Mrs Lee told me, is to reach out. The participants at both events at Hong Lim Park were in their own way doing just that. But we don't need to wait till the next event to take our first step.

","   CONGRATULATIONS to the 54 health-care professionals who received the prestigious Healthcare Humanity Awards (""Health-care awards reunite old colleagues""; last Wednesday). I am confident that such recognition will inspire other health-care workers to give back to society.
Besides these workers, there is another group of selfless people who demonstrate unconditional love. These are the family caregivers - the unsung heroes who serve as an inspiration to those whose lives they touch (""Don't overlook caregivers' well-being"" by Ms Ada Chan Siew Foen; April 27).
Caring for family members who suffer from chronic illnesses or have special needs is not easy. It is a taxing task that calls for much personal sacrifice. It may also cause psychological strain, for instance, when a loved one's illness suddenly takes a turn for the worse.
At the Ain Society's charity dinner on April 27, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said Singapore should try to improve its system of meritocracy to ensure that it continues to benefit society, and this means showing compassion even while meritocracy is at work.
He rightly pointed out that ""a compassionate meritocracy can help us build a resilient and inclusive society"" while ""a selfish meritocracy will divide us and ruin our society"".
We need to appreciate people in Singapore who do not always look out for economic gain, but the emotional ""gains"" of others.
Family caregivers are such people. Yet, even though they give so much of themselves, often sacrificing their own health and social needs, their efforts have gone unrecognised for decades.
I urge the Government to recognise the dedication and commitment of family caregivers through Humanity Awards, and send the signal that caregiving is a noble job.
If we are to raise the standard of caregiving in Singapore to better cope with the rapidly ageing population, there must be more appreciation for family caregivers on a national level.

","   When Aidli ""Alin"" Mosbit's Dan Tiga Dara Terbang Ke Bulan (And Three Virgins Fly To The Moon) was first staged in 1995, the play startled the Malay community with its frank discussion of sex and gender inequality.
Three years later, in 1998, she wrote Ikan Cantik (Beautiful Fish), which drew more gasps and some finger-wagging. The play's six Malay actresses shaved their heads and used vulgarities, leading conservative Malay-Muslims to label the practices un-Islamic.
But, with time, the realm of theatre has become accepted as a safe space to explore and wrestle with issues concerning the Malay-Muslim community and, in recent years, the envelope has been pushed even further.
A new wave of Malay theatre artists has been giving contemporary issues an airing. The difference between them and their predecessors, however, is that their works have a more universal, ""We Are Singapore"" type of appeal and transcend racial lines, aided by English surtitles, making the plays more accessible to non-Malay-speaking audiences.
One such play in which various racial and religious issues overlap inextricably is playwright Alfian Sa'at's Nadirah (2009), which clinched the Life! Theatre Award for Best Original Script in 2010.
In the quietly powerful work, a young Muslim woman struggles with her Chinese mother's possible conversion to Christianity. The play was sold out during its restaging here in 2011 and warmly received when it played in Kuala Lumpur last year.
Another Malay theatre practitioner who tackles concerns relatable to the general Singapore and regional audience is Teater Ekamatra's associate artist Irfan Kasban, 25, who is seeing more non-Malays among the company's predominantly Malay audience.
Last year, his site-specific work, This Placement, staged in and around the former Geylang Fire Station, dealt with the problems of a fading physical heritage. And earlier this year, a more naturalistic work, Tahan, captured the experience of a young man serving his national service stint on the police force.
Plays using both English and Malay such as interracial national service drama Charged (2010) and Mata Hati (2011) - about one fictional Malay politician's indiscretions - have further broadened the appeal of Malay theatre companies. Both were produced by Ekamatra and directed by its artistic director Zizi Azah.
Alin, 40, founder of five-year-old theatre group Panggung Arts, says: ""Nowadays, when I talk about Malay issues, I don't feel like talking about them as Malay issues. I really feel that it's our issue - each and every one of us.
""If you call yourself a Singaporean, whatever that's affecting me now will somehow affect you.""
The actress-playwright is directing a restaging of the pivotal And Three Virgins, which opens at the Esplanade Theatre Studio later this week. This time, it will be performed by a new trio of actresses: Siti Khalijah Zainal, 27, Shida Mahadi, 32, and Nur Khairiyah Ramli.
Khairiyah, 25, whose first production - the doublebill Penantian (The Wait) - made its debut at The Substation last Friday, is one of the defining faces of the up-and-coming generation of Malay theatremakers.
The boldness and ambition of this generation extends not just to issues, but also the wearing of multiple hats in the theatre. Khairiyah, who exemplifies this, has not limited herself to acting, but has also taken on the challenge of writing and directing.
Going against type
Crafted together with playwright, actress and costume designer Molizah Mohammed Mohter, 35, Penantian centres around three women who are struggling to balance their personal lives with the world beyond - and who are all waiting for something.
Khairiyah says: ""It's nothing specifically to do with the Malay community. They just happen to be Malay girls.""
She does not want to rehash the same tired racialised caricatures. ""There's always this stereotype in theatre and on TV that, oh, Malays are lazy,"" she adds, with exasperation. ""Yeah, we've got that already. I think we should move on from there.""
Established Malay theatre groups Teater Ekamatra and Teater Kami have also made confident inroads in these directions with their recent offerings.
Zizi, 33, says: ""I think we feel that our experience is not separate from the rest of Singapore. We are Malay Singaporeans. We are both at the same time. It's not exclusive."" Her most recent work, Not Counted (2012), confronted inequalities in Singapore's meritocracy, some of which stem from religious and racial stereotypes.
Malay theatre has been evolving gradually over the past three decades, with many, including Zizi, feeling that the 1990s were a turning point. That decade saw a definite shift from the grand proscenium stage to the intimate black-box space and a certain daring in the way works have approached religion and social issues.
Teater Kami, Teater Artistik and Teater Ekamatra - three of the main Malay theatre groups here - were each established more than 20 years ago. They initiated a departure in the late 1980s from the traditional folktale-based Malay theatre and bangsawan (Malay opera) that had previously characterised the scene.
Today, some feel these historical works still have a place. Teater Artistik's president Roslan Mohamad Daud, 48, says his group stresses classic Malay writing, even if the market for these more literary works might be smaller: ""With theatre, it's an opportunity for audience members to appreciate and see the richness of the language.""
While many Malay theatre groups are venturing into the territory of multilingual plays, he believes that a diversity of voices is needed.
Relevance to Malay community
Beyond the question of form, there is the overarching question of whether Malay theatre can straddle both worlds - the traditional and contemporary.
Teater Kami is one group that has managed to put on works from both ends of the spectrum. Last year, it restaged The Ballad Of Tun Fatimah, a historical work about the last Sultanah of Malacca, and, for the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival in January, they performed C.I.N.T.A, a series of five intertwined modern love stories set in Singapore.
The Substation's artistic director, Noor Effendy Ibrahim, says: ""The role of Malay theatre would be the same as what any ethnic or minority voice theatre should be. It has to give that side of the story to the national landscape.""
Effendy, 40, previously the artistic director of Teater Ekamatra, is encouraged by the path that Malay theatre has taken.
But he raises some pointed questions: ""Has Malay theatre been seeking the larger audience at the expense of the Malay audience? Are we still visible to the Malay community? Are we still a relevant voice to them? Within the Malay community, what is the role of Malay theatre? I think we're not sure yet.""
He adds: ""It's not that it should be for only a Malay audience, but I feel that there is a point in the Malay community coming to see Malay theatre as a necessary or powerful tool to speak out from. It's one of the platforms where the Malay story can be told, can be shared, where there can be discourse.""
The 2010 winner of TheatreWorks' 24-Hour Playwriting Competition, Ahmad Musta'ain Khamis, 26, is one young playwright intrigued by community theatre and how drama can be used for education or social intervention.
He thinks Malay theatre continues to matter to Malays and Singaporeans at large as ""a very safe platform to explore issues which would normally never surface"" or ""to tell or inform others about the Malay culture or Islamic culture"".
The trainee teacher's winning work, titled Serunding, toured various community centres around the island in 2010 and 2011. His one-woman play starred Alin as a Malay-Muslim mother who is torn up over the departure of her daughter.
Ahmad is currently working with a madrasah in Singapore to stage a work for the Singapore Drama Educators' Association's conference later this month. He says: ""As a Malay-Muslim, even I don't know what goes on (in a madrasah) and there's so much speculation. I just really wanted to know.""
Willing to try everything
This clutch of up-and-coming artists such as Ahmad, Irfan and Khairiyah tend to be multihyphenates: They are willing to try their hand at acting, writing, directing and even lighting, set and costume design.
Mish'aal Syed Nasar, 30, a member of the recently founded Malay theatre collective Hatch Theatrics, notes that each member takes on multiple roles from one production to the next. He might act in a performance and do production management for the next - no sweat.
Young practitioners such as actress Siti Khalijah are working with different theatre groups, not necessarily those in Malay theatre. She has worked extensively with The Necessary Stage, which does primarily English-language theatre and recently made her debut with The Theatre Practice, known for its Mandarin productions. In the multilingual The Bride Always Knocks Twice, she played a 14th-century Malay concubine.
Shida, one of the actresses in And Three Virgins, says: ""I think this generation is braver. They're not restricted by self-esteem issues. They seem very confident. Their attitude is, 'I might suck at it, but at least I'll try it.' I think that's very encouraging.""
But director Alin suggests that emerging practitioners continue to master specific areas of their craft. She uses the iceberg as a metaphor: ""You need to be so much more underneath to be that much above. What we see on top is just the tip of the iceberg, but usually the iceberg is more than that. You need to be strong in your foundation before you can grow tall and wide.""
Zizi, who teaches dramatic writing to secondary and tertiary students and also heads Ekamatra's playwright mentorship programme, echoes the sentiment that the younger generation is more daring and unflinching in dealing with new or conventionally difficult material, such as politics or religion.
She says: ""They're not afraid of dealing with the issue and really playing around with it. They use so many different devices, they pull from so many different traditions and they create their own traditions, which I think is really a mark of how we have grown and developed by leaps and bounds.""
One of her students, School of the Arts student Nur Sabrina Dzulkifli, 16, was the winner in the youth category of last year's 24-Hour Playwriting Competition. Sabrina fleshed out some mature topics such as surrogacy and abortion in her script Of Babies (Not Really) And People, which looked at marriage and parenthood. She says: ""I believe theatre is a medium for social change and that it also has to reflect society as a whole. Only when you reflect society will society be able to look at itself from an objective point of view.""
Amid these evolving trends and directions, one thing is for sure - what is affectionately known as the spirit of ""gotong royong"" (mutual help) is one of the strong characteristics of Malay theatre and one that has persisted through the decades. It can only intensify as the borders between theatre companies become more fluid.
""At the end of the day,"" says Khairiyah, ""theatre is for everyone. We're all here together.""

","   A week after Malaysians voted in their 13th General Election, the political fires are still raging.
Was it a Chinese or a wider Malaysian tsunami that caused the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition to lose its share of the popular vote to the opposition? Is Malaysia more polarised along racial lines or is there a sharper urban-rural divide?
The air has been thick with these questions and the ill-effects of a bitterly fought election that has divided the country.
Cut through the political fog and rabble-rousing though and it is clear the underlying issue facing Malaysia hasn't changed in the last 50 years.
Indeed, it took a well-aimed potshot from across the Causeway to make that quite clear to me.
That's how I felt when I read what former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said in the heat of the hustings.
Speaking at a rally in Selangor, he attacked the opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP) for wanting to sow discord between Malays and Chinese, and referred to Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP).
""DAP uses the PAP way. When PAP was in Malaysia, it used the slogan 'Malaysian Malaysia'. It said Malays took everything, others nothing. Is that true?"" he asked.
Writing later in his blog, he said: ""The meritocracy promoted by the DAP will mean diminishing opportunities for the Malays in education and in business. This will result in Malays becoming less and less qualified and poorer.""
Ouch?
If any nerves were jangled here, you wouldn't have noticed as there was hardly a whimper, save for a reader's letter in The Straits Times Forum Page from a Malay Singaporean who wrote that the community was doing rather well.
Perhaps it was just as well. No need to add oil to a raging fire, not when it's no longer Singapore's fight.
What then is the issue about?
For older Singaporeans, it is an all too familiar story.
When the two countries separated in 1965, it was their differences in race policy that led to the break-up.
Thereafter, Singapore took a merit-based approach while Malaysia continued its policy of promoting affirmative action and special rights for Malays, with incentives in business, education and housing, under its bumiputera policy.
For readers too young to know those tumultuous days, here's an exchange from one particular debate which goes to the heart of the issue. It took place in the Federal Parliament in Kuala Lumpur in May 1965 between then Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Tun Dr Mahathir who was an Umno MP.
Dr Mahathir: They (Chinese Singaporeans) have never known Malay rule and cannot bear the idea that the people they have kept so long under their heel should now be in a position to rule them.
Mr Lee: If we delude people into believing they are poor because there are no Malay rights... where are we going to end up? You let people in the kampungs believe that they are poor because we (the Chinese) don't speak Malay?... Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social or education policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indians and others opposing Malay rights.
Almost 50 years later, these same issues are being replayed in Malaysia, this time between contending political parties and their supporters.
At issue is whether affirmative action has benefited the majority of Malays and the country as a whole, or enriched only a select few, as the opposition contends.
But the more fundamental question is the one Dr Mahathir so starkly raised, which is the permanence of Malay rule in Malaysia.
Singapore did not accept this, its leaders arguing that that was not their understanding when they agreed to the merger. For non-Malays in Malaysia, however, separation was not an option, and many left the country to start afresh, including to Singapore.
It now looks like those who stayed have decided to throw in their lot with the opposition.
But can Malaysia accept a multiracial approach to governance and not one based on permanent Malay rule?
It is a question Malaysians must ultimately confront. We can only hope they will be able to do so peacefully. A successful Malaysia is good for Singapore.
But there are lessons for us here.
First is the importance of looking after the interest of the minority races. Malaysia's experience shows that the grievances and injustices felt by the minorities will not go away but will build up and, if not addressed, can lead to much grief.
Singapore's multiracial approach is ingrained, but there is clearly much that can be improved. For example, there have been complaints by Malays and Indians over the years that they face discrimination when looking for jobs or homes to rent.
These have to be taken seriously and action taken by the authorities or they will become entrenched norms.
Second, while key institutions such as the civil service, the judiciary, schools and the police and armed forces should be as professionally run as possible, they should take into account Singapore's multiracial society.
Last year, when Adil Hakeem Mohamad Rafee became the first Malay recipient of a President's Scholarship since 1968, it was a wait too long for the community and for Singapore.
Could more have been done to correct the imbalance without sacrificing meritocratic principles? It calls for greater effort and sensitivity to the idea that Singapore is a richer society because of the diversity of its people.
I believe this will become more evident in the years to come when China grows in strength and extends its influence even more in the region. Without the richness of its multiracial people, Singapore risks becoming another Chinese city among the many in the mainland, perhaps not even a first-tier one.
Preserving and nurturing multiracialism is hence an essential part of strengthening the country's cultural resilience.
Barely a month after being kicked out of Malaysia, Mr Lee threw this challenge for the future:
""Here we make the model multiracial society. This is not a country that belongs to any single community: it belongs to all of us. Over 100 years ago this was a mudflat swamp. Today, this is a modern city. Ten years from now this will be a metropolis. Never fear!""
It was a fitting response then to Dr Mahathir.
Forty-eight years on, it still is.

Permanent Malay rule or multiracial approach?

","   Lingering images from Malaysia's bruising May 5 General Election symbolise the new highs and lows reached by the country's complex brand of race-based politics.
At one end, there was the moving video of the sea of supporters at an opposition Pakatan Rakyat rally breaking into the national anthem Negaraku, with Chinese waving Parti Islam SeMalaysia flags with the white orb and green background, and Malays bearing the rocket flag of the Chinese-based Democratic Action Party.
At the other extreme, there was the screaming headline on the front page of the right-wing Malay newspaper Utusan Malaysia, ""Apa lagi Cina mahu"" (What else do the Chinese want?), as the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition recoiled from the desertion of Chinese voters.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has since moved away from racialising the election outcome, but looking at the messiness of the polls from the other side of the Causeway, the thought would have crossed many Singaporeans' minds that the People's Action Party had done the right thing all along by containing race-based parties and communal politics.
Malaysian politics ""makes the GRC system look good"", a friend quipped on Facebook.
The 25-year-old group representation constituency system, criticised in some quarters for creating giant wards favouring the incumbent government in electoral contests, requires political parties to field multiracial teams of candidates. This requirement, at the very least, is its strength - it ensures minority representation and prevents candidates from making potentially divisive appeals or put-downs on the basis of race.
But it would be wrong to make the leap from this point to generalise that Singapore has achieved better interracial relations. Instead, we should take a good look in the mirror and see the limitations of our model and attitudes towards ethnic differences.
My own feeling is that after nearly half a century of independence and as a comfortable majority, Chinese Singaporeans are no longer as sensitive to the culture and concerns of minority groups as our forefathers. A generation ago, many Chinese could speak simple Malay, having come of age at a time when Singapore and the Malay peninsula had a kind of port city-and-economic hinterland relationship and traffic between the two was much more fluid.
Last October, when then National Trades Union Congress employee and Singapore permanent resident Amy Cheong directed her profanity-fuelled online rant at void deck Malay weddings, I found it offensive, as did many Singaporeans.
Then I realised that despite such festivities being a ubiquitous sight in HDB heartlands, I myself did not know why Malays held their weddings in void decks, as opposed to the restaurant wedding banquets typical of the Chinese. I had never thought to ask, nor had I ever attended a traditional Malay wedding.
Several Malay Singaporeans have since posted online cultural explanations of void deck weddings. Back when they and other ethnic groups lived in kampungs, Malay weddings would be held in a courtyard and the whole village would be invited. Traditionally, neighbours would help out, from cooking to receiving guests. The communality of kampung life still holds a lot of resonance for Malays, and so weddings are held in the open areas of HDB void decks.
There are other examples of ignorance bordering on insensitivity. Younger Chinese Singaporeans may be guilty of asking Malay classmates and colleagues out for meals or eating in front of them during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. They may also not know the difference between Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji though both are public holidays - the first celebrating the end of Ramadan, the second recalling the Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son Ismail and also signifying the end of the annual haj pilgrimage made by Muslims worldwide.
One would think that the acquisition of a common language, English, would enable questions about inter-ethnic differences to be asked and answered. The lack of desire to broach those questions in the first place is telling. Sociologists like Geoffrey Benjamin have long noted that Singapore's CMIO (Chinese, Malay, Indian and Others) model of multiracialism, while maintaining identification with a particular race, stresses only key aspects of that culture which are not incompatible with nation-building and disciplines one into looking for similarities with other groups rather than differences.
Thus, for example, the potentially discriminatory caste system in India - where birth determines your social rank - is not upheld as a marker of Indian-ness here because it clashes with Singapore's meritocracy. More contentiously, the Chinese identity had to find substantiation through the compulsory study of Mandarin because there were otherwise too many Chinese dialects spoken.
The biggest good that has come out of this is national integration, so much so that one can detect quite easily a new immigrant who did not grow up here. The introduction of bilingual education in English and one of three main mother tongues - Mandarin, Malay and Tamil - was nothing less than social re-engineering to find maximum common ground. CMIO created a new society free of the baggage and clutter of the old, and helped post-1965 Singaporeans to travel light.
But it also means that we do not really comprehend diversity because it has either been flattened out, appropriated or ignored. Just as I do not know what makes me Hokkien or Peranakan, I do not know what makes someone else Tamil, Malayalee, Sikh or Chindian beyond superficialities like skin colour, a turban or the sound of an unfamiliar tongue.
It is true that the increasing use of English will make us more similar than different, but something valuable in our heritage is also lost in the process. There will always be parts of who we are that can only be conveyed in Hokkien or Mandarin or Malay or Arabic. Genuine multiculturalism requires the openness and curiosity to explore these differences.
If it feels to us that in Malaysia there is too much talk about race - good and bad - perhaps the problem with Singapore is that there is not enough of it, beneath a veil of politeness broken by periodic online invectives and the filing of police reports.
I hope that this little red dot too can be expansive enough to not just accommodate, but appreciate the diversity in our midst.
I wish there were more serious, honest and meaningful conversations about ethnic-related issues, not just among community leaders behind closed doors, but among classmates, a taxi driver and his passenger or between neighbours. And that once we have achieved an understanding, like family members, we can laugh at our differences.

","   THE phrase ""unhealthy foreign cultural trends and behaviour"" in my letter (""Cancer ad goes against Asian values""; Forum Online, May 10) has been taken out of context by Dr Gil Simon Schneider (""No such thing as 'Asian values'""; Forum Online, last Wednesday).
While there are some similarities between Eastern and Western cultural traditions, there are also differences. There is a lot that Asians can learn from other countries, including the United States and European nations, while Westerners can also learn from the East.
Our traditions and practices are sometimes different from those in other countries but these values have worked well for us. This is not to denigrate the values practised in other countries.
Our experience shows that values like pragmatism, a willingness to adapt to best practices from around the world, meritocracy, multi-religiosity, multilingualism, multiracialism and multiculturalism have all contributed to economic progress, political stability and peace.
These values, combined with cultural attributes like thrift, hard work, putting family, community and society before self, and collectivism as opposed to individualism, have irrefutably contributed to good and clean governance in Singapore.
These values have been adopted by sheer necessity to ensure our survival, such that Singapore has now one of the best standards of living in the world.
These rich values have formed the bulwark for our phenomenal progress. It is in this context that I maintain that our accepted norms of decency and cultural behaviour should not be eroded by unhealthy trends from anywhere.

","   IT IS interesting that even as the Transport Minister emphasises that the COE system should remain market-based, he is essentially considering the redistribution of car ownership. Could it be that the Government is pandering to a vocal minority? Or are these the signs of a budding socialist movement?
The COE, or certificate of entitlement, was introduced in 1990 to control the car population and congestion. It complemented the existing high registration taxes by requiring a motorist to bid for the privilege of owning a car. This piece of paper with a validity of 10 years could cost anything from $1 to more than $100,000, depending on the state of the economy and the size of the COE quota. In recent years, the latter, as well as an increasing population and growing affluence, conspired to push COE premiums to new highs.
The result of grossly overpriced cars becoming even more expensive led many in Singapore to lament that vehicle ownership was out of their reach. Astronomical car prices also contributed to headline inflation.
So on Feb 25, the Government introduced progressive registration taxes and vehicle financing restrictions.
Now, it is setting its sights on what is likely to be a revamp of the COE system and - even if it is not saying it out loud - basically ensuring that the masses would be able to afford a car, come tax or high COE premiums.
But how do you do that without taking apart the free market system that is the COE bidding exercise? How do you do that in a society that has been told from Day One that this is a meritocracy, one where hard work is rewarded, and that those rewards can be used to acquire and enjoy such material comforts as are deemed appropriate?
Cars in Singapore may be obscenely priced but most understand why they have to be on this tiny island. But the minister's comments may open a Pandora's box.
On the surface, his first point makes sense - to retain the original purpose of COE Category A (for cars below 1,600cc). It is not right that luxury cars should encroach into the so-called bread-and-butter segment and turn Cat A into a mini-Cat B (for cars above 1,600cc). After all, that is what categories are for in the first place.
But the problem is the market does not remain static. If a Cat A COE is reserved only for cheaper cars, it is safe to assume the COE premium would be low. But for how long? Because its affordability will surely attract more buyers to that category, especially if the alternatives - Cat B or the open category - cost more. The market will find its own equilibrium. The problem is supply and demand - there are just too few COEs available for too many buyers.
No system is perfect, not the current COE system nor the one that will replace it. But at least, it is based on principles that Singaporeans were taught to accept. More importantly, if you cannot afford a new car, there remains an alternative - a second-hand one.
But it is the minister's second point about car ownership that could have social implications. With 7 per cent of car owners owning more than one car and their cars making up 14 per cent of all cars, some people are unhappy about multiple-car ownership.
What's next? No multiple ownership of property? Lynch the guy with more than one good class bungalow? It is a slippery slope. So far, ordinary folks have not had much opportunity to denounce the rich but this could highlight the divide more clearly and formalise ""We are the 99 per cent"" sentiments.
Maybe income tax could be raised or more wealth taxes introduced, but there are economic downsides to punishing the rich. We may not like them simply because they are rich but hey, that's life; who said it was fair? If the majority can accept that some are multimillionaires but most will never be, then we should let the well-heeled buy that Ferrari and/or Aston Martin in addition to an S-Class.
Moreover, a tycoon with five cars is unlikely to have any real impact on the roads. He is not the cause of congestion on the CTE because unlike the heartlander, he does not live in the north. Also, his five cars are never on the road at the same time and he is always out of town. Which merely reinforces the point that usage and parking charges could ultimately be the only real solution to easing congestion.
Finally, one very important reason cars should not be made even pricier and multiple-car ownership should not be prevented - diversity. If everyone were allowed only one car, then that car would probably be a seven-seat minivan because it has to be as practical as possible. Because no one will buy a coupe or a convertible or a two-seater, mid-engined sports car or anything that is remotely exotic.
So if nothing else, say no to a COE system that veers towards populism and wealth taxes as that will make the cars on our roads really boring to look at.

","   ACTING Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin signalled a change of heart in the Government when he said this week that legislation was one way of dealing with unfair treatment at the workplace. His comments, made at an annual seminar of the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (Tafep), marked a distinct shift in his stand from last year, when he had rejected rigid anti-discrimination laws because they could have the unintended effect of harming the people they were supposed to help. But the situation warrants a rethink given that complaints of discrimination reached an all-time high last year. Of the 303 complaints Tafep handled, half came from Singaporeans who averred that their bosses preferred foreigners over locals. This continued a pattern that began forming in 2011. Matters need to be put right before the pattern hardens into a norm.
Singaporeans are not averse to foreign participation in the labour force. Nobody who knows the crucial role that foreigners play in the economy could realistically adopt a protectionist attitude towards them. Singapore's small size and population require it to stay open to foreign talent as much as to foreign investment, technology and markets. However, that openness must rest on a level playing field being available to Singaporeans. If employers select employees based on their nationality or race, they subvert the idea of equal opportunity on which meritocracy depends. Finance and information technology are cited as two industries where the practice is prevalent. The problem is compounded by suspicions that some foreign bosses prefer employees from their own national or racial backgrounds. To argue against this problem is not to be protectionist, and certainly not xenophobic, but to ask for fairness.
From the national point of view as well, a strong case can be made out for the need for a Singapore core in the workforce that could be expected to preserve the national interest. Other countries adopt this approach, with some mandating that employers must show that there are no suitable locals whom they can hire before they are allowed to take on foreigners. As the Government contemplates a new way of ensuring anti-discrimination, it might consider strengthening the existing framework before embarking on legislative sanctions. The National Trades Union Congress should throw its considerable weight more fully behind anti-discrimination efforts. Using the tripartite framework which has been honed over the decades, it should reach out to employers and ask for a mindset change on the hiring of locals. The argument that laws will kick in if progress is not made should help focus minds on the need for action.

","   Workers' Party (WP) chief Low Thia Khiang discussed the state of the opposition in a recent interview with two scholars from China studying in Singapore. Below is an excerpt of their dialogue, first published on Zaobao.com
Q: What is the impact of Singapore's political environment on the WP's development? How does the opposition survive, develop and grow stronger?
Singapore politics has formed its own characteristics over decades of development.
On the one hand, it draws on the Western parliamentary democracy of one man one vote. On the other hand, it absorbs some Oriental political principles where the government exercises macro-control over social development.
It is difficult for the opposition to develop in such an environment where it is at a disadvantage as almost all national resources and information are in the hands of the government.
In addition, the Government has basically achieved good governance since independence. Even if the people are unhappy about certain aspects, they will not try to topple the government but seek help from the Government via acceptable channels. This is the edge enjoyed by the ruling PAP.
The one-party dominance here changed during the 2011 General Election; the opposition also made progress.
However, on the whole, we are still at the start-up stage, or in the words of Mr Deng Xiaoping, crossing the river by feeling for stepping stones.
As Singapore politics develops, the ruling and opposition parties will adjust their strategies to meet their development accordingly.
Q: Will the three constituencies under the WP become the party's strongholds and vote banks?
We have yet to consider if these are our strongholds. The WP may be managing Aljunied GRC, Hougang and Punggol East but their future development does not just depend on the party's development, it also depends on how Singapore develops.
Our wards are concentrated in the north-eastern part, we cannot say if these will be our strongholds or vote banks.
As I said after the Punggol East by-election, the results were unexpected as we were unsure of the swing votes. It is too early to say if these wards will become our strongholds or how much support we will get in future elections.
Q: How does the WP strengthen its team building in the light of a changing society and voter demographics? Is there any special focus on the elite and young?
We recruit members based on their talent, ability and knowledge, for knowledge is a basic criterion in deciding if a person has political vision and management ability. We also assess them holistically, such as their credibility and moral character.
Meritocracy has served Singapore well in the past decades but that is not to say it is perfect. The elite may not be all-rounders. They are smart, well-educated but may not be representative of all and may not do everything well.
We also cannot say the non-elite with grassroots background will not perform. Every profession is different; the elite are not proficient in everything.
We cannot generalise, we should explore and set strategies according to different needs.
Q: Has the WP thought of playing a bigger role in the future? Does it have clear guidelines?
Singapore voters have higher expectations of the WP but I harbour no ambition of becoming the prime minister.
We should be pragmatic and conscientious in serving the people, helping them through making political demands.
As for the WP ideology, it would be the ""First World Parliament"" we proposed during the 2011 General Election where we seek a more democratic, fairer country, where Parliament is able to monitor the government and where voters are represented at all levels.
Democracy is not a bad system but it is not flawless. We should work together to rectify, solve problems arising from political development.
When receiving his honorary doctorate from the NTU recently, Indonesian President (Susilo Bambang) Yudhoyono said Indonesia had broken the notion that democracy and economic growth could not go hand in hand.
Political transformation is not painless but all countries have to go through such a phase. Indonesia's development is generally successful despite its problems.
However, Indonesia is a big country and Singapore is small, so we have to be more cautious about our development. We have no room for mistakes, this is our disadvantage.
Q: What are the future challenges for Singapore and how should it tackle them?
Let's talk about the population issue.
Singapore has released the Population White Paper where it states a population of 6.9 million by 2030 is required to maintain economic growth of 3 per cent. This is worth scrutiny.
During the parliamentary debate, I pointed out population and economic growth must be sustainable, keeping in mind the big picture of how society evolved.
Singapore is small and if we have to keep relying on population growth to develop our economy and society, then do we need 10 million people or more for growth beyond 2030?
A macro-micro combination is important in development, both details and strategic foresight matter. Specific development may be important but there must be overall coordination, this is especially so for a small country.

"," Xenophobia
","   Some Singaporeans are getting worked up over xenophobia (""Zero tolerance for intolerance""; March30) or acts of racism against foreigners (""Eye-opening experiences bust foreigner stereotype"" by Ms Abigail Wong Poh Yock; May 11).
Xenophobia is hardly a major problem here. If it were, would two million foreigners willingly live and work on this island?
Instead, we should redirect our focus to two critical issues: the unsatisfactory nature of Singaporeans' interracial relations and the language problem.
Singapore is perhaps the only country in the world which relies on a meritocracy-unfriendly electoral system to ensure minority representation. The Group Representation Constituency (GRC) scheme suggests that some Singaporeans accept or reject candidates based on their ethnicity.
If this is how some Singaporeans respond to their ethnically different compatriots, how else does one expect them to behave towards foreigners from geographically and culturally disparate nations?
Therefore, we should seek ways to reduce the problem that gave rise to the GRC system.
I agree with last Sunday's commentary (""Let's talk about race""), which says Singaporeans should ""take a good look in the mirror and see the limitations of our model and attitudes towards ethnic differences"".
The Government urges Singaporeans to embrace inclusiveness, yet Mandarin-speaking foreigners who cannot communicate in Singapore's business language are allowed to work in front-line positions, excluding non-Mandarin-speaking Singaporeans from satisfactory service (""Ensure front-line staff can speak simple English"" by Mr Zainuddin Abdul Kader; Feb26).
Singaporeans tying themselves in knots over xenophobia should first seek policies that ensure that Singaporean minorities are not alienated in their own homeland.
When the twin obstacles of interracial and language problems have been resolved, or at least significantly reduced, combating xenophobia will naturally be less challenging.

","   MERITOCRACY has always been the buzzword when it comes to hiring at Citi Singapore but there is also an emphasis on building up local talent.
The bank's new head of human resources Evangeline Chua, 45, said that these days, the bank is conscious of furthering the national agenda to build a Singapore core.
""On the one hand, we will never discriminate against one nationality, and we will pick the best person for the job. But we will ask ourselves the fundamental question, about whether there is a local talent we can place in the position,"" she said.
Ms Chua, a Singaporean who was appointed in April, explained that the bank does draw on the talent pool from its affiliates across the world if talent is scarce. But Singapore still stands to benefit.
She added: ""This person that we bring in from overseas can develop local talent, and eventually the local talent can take on those functions.""
Of Citi Singapore's 10,000 or so employees, nearly 60 per cent are Singaporeans. Another 25 per cent are permanent residents, and the rest are foreigners.
""Having a 'Singapore core' means having Singaporeans fill most of the key positions in the bank. For this to happen, progressive steps are required to develop our home-grown talent so that Singaporeans have the right skill sets to excel in these positions and are truly the 'best person for the job',"" she said.
Some areas in which she sees a talent gap include the technology functions, global transaction business and specialised areas such as liquefied natural gas traders.
To help bridge the shortage for transaction bankers, Citi Singapore and the National University of Singapore launched a transaction banking course for undergraduates in January.
The bank also has other schemes, such as the Citi Mentorship Programme, and the Citi Associate Programme, a formalised internship programme for undergraduates.
However, Ms Chua added that in dealing with developing Generation Y leaders, there is also the important task of retaining them. In 2011, a committee was set up to look into these issues.
For example, the Gen Y worker looks for challenging, stimulating work, and is no longer content to be a worker bee.
""They want 'stretch' assignments, want to work for managers they really respect. By creating awareness and educating the line manager, they will be able to help us retain this generation of leaders,"" she added.

"," Surcharges
","   The divide between rich and poor is now front and centre in an ongoing review of car ownership policies. Goh Chin Lian reports on differing views of what a fair policy would look like.
THEY are two Singaporeans who would be affected by a recent suggestion to the Government that people who own one car should pay a surcharge to own a second, third or more cars. But they have sharply different views on it.
Mr Lewis Poon, 50, and Mr Soon Sze Meng, 35, belong to the 45 per cent of households here that own at least one car, and both fall into the high-income bracket.
Sales manager Mr Poon thinks the proposal highlighted by Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew last month is unfair: ""The rich work equally hard. Money doesn't drop from the sky for them.""
Mr Soon, a director in a multinational corporation, believes it is fair. A wealthy person should pay more for the privilege of owning more than one car, given that he will deprive someone else of owning one family car, he maintains. ""In principle, it is fair and just for the rich to contribute more to society that enables them to earn their wealth,"" adds the Stanford University graduate in public policy.
Their separate stances mirror a wider debate on what should drive car ownership in land-scarce Singapore: the free market, in which those who have the money deserve a car; or government policy with an eye on social equity, in which even those on lower incomes can afford a vehicle.
Until now, the Government has controlled the car population through a vehicle quota system where people bid for a certificate of entitlement (COE), but spiralling prices have put even small-engine capacity category vehicles out of the reach of many.
The Land Transport Authority is seeking public feedback on two proposals from the motoring industry and the public to improve the COE system, it announced yesterday.
Besides levying a surcharge for multiple cars owned by the same individual, another idea is to peg the car COE categories to engine power or make it an additional requirement on top of the existing criterion of engine capacity.
This is to address the influx of luxury models in the 1,600cc and below category, which is meant for buyers of smaller, budget cars.
The stakes are high, whether or not the system is changed. Failure to ensure free-market fairness may lead to economic inefficiencies and, in targeting wealthy folk who worked hard for their fortune, undermine Singapore's meritocratic system.
Failure to ensure fairness for all who want to own a car, however, may be socially divisive and cause instability.
So, just who has the ""right"" to own a car? How should the right be allocated, given Singapore's limited land for roads and cars? Should the rich pay more to own cars?
Not black and white
WHEN COEs first came about in 1990, issues of fairness reared their head even then.
There were four specific categories for cars: small (below 1,000cc), medium-sized (1,000cc to 1,600cc), big (1,600cc to 2,000cc) and luxury (2,000cc and above).
Economists advocated a single category and leaving the market to allocate the cars, whatever their size, to those most willing and able to pay for them.
Politicians countered that if there was only a single category, owners of big cars who had deeper pockets would squeeze out owners of small cars with more modest budgets. They also feared that the car-owning aspirations of the middle and lower-middle classes would be thwarted.
As then MP for Thomson Leong Horn Kee, declared in a parliamentary debate on the COE: ""The road should be accessible and used by all classes of people."" His proposal for four car categories was adopted by the Government.
Said then Minister for Communications and Information Yeo Ning Hong: ""The Government has chosen an approach that is of greater benefit to the lower- and middle-income owners.""
However, by 1998, COE premiums of luxury and big cars had converged with, and on occasions fallen below, those of medium-sized and small cars.
In January that year, the COE premium for a big car fell to $50 - against a small car's $26,592 and medium-sized car's $43,088.
In the 1999 review of the COE system, economists were back pressing for a single COE category. But they suggested making successful bidders pay more for cars with a larger engine capacity or higher open market value (OMV).
The Government took a different tack. It merged the four car categories into two - cars of 1,600cc and below, and large cars above 1,600cc - to remove distortions arising from the small quota in the former small-car and luxury-car categories.
A review committee, made up of MPs, said the vehicle quota system is ""primarily a mechanism to allocate scarce resources, and is not intended to be a progressive tax measure"".
It said vehicle taxes more adequately address social equity concerns: Luxury car owners already pay more additional registration fees. Cars with larger engine capacity attract higher road tax rates.
The changes appeared to have appeased concerns about fairness until a decade later, in 2009, when premium makes like Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volvo started bringing in models of smaller engine capacities for environmental reasons.
The quota of COEs was also being reduced to curb vehicle growth. As a result, in January this year, COE premiums for cars 1,600cc and below skyrocketed to more than $90,000, and those for larger cars were just a tad higher.
Would-be buyers decry that those with deeper pockets are outbidding them for premium brands in the smaller car category. The premium made up more than one-third of the registrations, up from less than 7 per cent in 2010.
Some now want to peg COE categories to a car's OMV or its engine power, or a new COE category to be created for families who need a car.
Some suggest an extra tax of 50per cent of OMV on a second car, and 100 per cent for the third. Some want more COEs to be released for bidding.
The chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, Mr Cedric Foo, prefers to allocate more COEs to the 1,600cc and below category, but keep constant the total number of COEs for all categories, to control the car population. He says: ""We should not willy-nilly give up (this goal). Instead of helping one group, we congest up all the roads and you have a giant carpark.""
The MP for Pioneer belongs more to the camp that says fairness in car ownership is to make it accessible to all.
""I don't think policy should be painted purely black or white.
""As it is, it's already grey,"" he quips, referring to the separate COE categories for different engine capacities.
But car owner Mr Poon thinks such categories are inherently unfair: ""Why pay more for a higher-litre car and less for a smaller-litre car, when they are occupying the same space?""
Who really needs a car?
SOME see a car as a luxury, not as an essential as in the sense of education, health care and basic housing. Fairness in car ownership is about getting what one can pay for.
Others view a car as a necessity for work, or to ferry an elderly parent or a child. To them, fairness lies in keeping car ownership accessible to all.
IT specialist May Chia, in her 40s, worries that her teenage son, who is autistic, would cause a fuss on public transport: ""A car is a mobile shelter for us.""
But still others see a car as somewhere between being a luxury and an essential. This is because public transport - an essential good - is not as reliable, comprehensive and universal in serving the old, disabled and children like Madam Chia's son, as many would want it to be.
One argument is that if public transport here was excellent in these respects, Singapore as a society could treat the car more as a pure luxury good primarily for rich folk. Debates on who has the right to own a car would then become moot.
Narrowing the convenience gap between public and private transport, however, will take time, despite efforts to ramp up MRT and bus services.
Says senior research fellow Gillian Koh of the Institute of Policy Studies: ""This is just not fast enough and comfortable enough from the public's perception to make people either swop out of cars, or make it less sexy to be the one person driving one car to work.
""Many have families and the practicality of going out together in one car or making the multiple journeys each day with the car is just irresistible.""
Dr Koh suggests boosting the scheme for off-peak cars on top of waiting for more buses to be put on the road under a $1.1 billion programme announced last year.
A next step is to tax, progressively upwards, the second, third and fourth car.
This would apply to cars registered to the same address, to target households that have more prospect of car-pooling, instead of individuals, Dr Koh notes.
Her suggestion will affect the 8 to 9 per cent of households here which have more than one car.
However, economist Anthony Chin of the National University of Singapore thinks taxing people for additional cars will not solve the problem of car ownership because the rich will be able to pay the tax and still buy the additional cars.
Implementation is tricky, too. People could bypass the rules by registering their additional car in a relative's name at another address. The cost of policing and administration, like making checks on people's homes, will be astronomical.
Taxing additional cars may be symbolically satisfying for those who feel they are unfairly squeezed out of owning a car. But as Associate Professor Chin notes, ""eventually what is on paper and in practice is different"".
He offers another view of fairness in car ownership - not from the benefit to the individual, but in terms of how much that person can contribute to the Singapore economy.
Which is fairer, he asks: to allocate the car to a businessman who can cut million-dollar deals, or to a poor worker who contributes less to the economy?
Tax the rich more?
ONE fear is that ensuring cars are accessible to all as a matter of ""fairness"" will also fuel anti-wealth sentiment. Mr Lui has also raised this concern.
This runs up against another aspect of ""fairness"" - that those who have the money deserve the car.
Mr Seah Kian Peng, an MP for Marine Parade GRC, is mindful of the need to balance both perspectives. He is well ahead of the current debate: He proposed a surcharge on a second or third car in the 2008 and 2011 Budget debates in Parliament.
He tells Insight he was worried about how car growth outstripped road growth, which spelt more congestion; as well as fairness - or the perceived lack of it.
""We don't want a case of having the super, super rich and a big group of people lagging behind. That's not good for the Singapore community,"" he says.
In the same breath, he makes it clear that he is not against wealth or meritocracy: ""I'm all for meritocracy. I'm all for people who can achieve economic success and become wealthy. I see this as half-full and not half-empty, as they being able to contribute more and give back to society in higher taxes.""
This is a hard argument to make, however, if one takes the position that the COE is a congestion-control mechanism, and not a revenue-raising exercise.
In this context, how much more the wealthy contribute is not as important as the signal being sent that policies are not tilted towards the rich, but to those with lower incomes.
But would talented, highly mobile people move away if anti-wealth pressures held sway?
Or are pull factors like Singapore's rule of law, safety and cleanliness so strong that there is no need to worry?
Significantly, while Mr Seah's proposals were rejected in the past, they are now back on the table.
The rationale is that in exchange for the privilege of owning several cars, these owners should pay proportionately more by way of levies, Mr Lui has said.
But he drew the line at an outright ban on multiple-car ownership and at calls to spread car ownership more evenly.
""As a car is not a basic necessity, we should not prevent Singaporeans who can afford and wish to do so, to own more than one car,"" he said. ""It is also extremely difficult for the Government to exercise social equity considerations from the perspective of deciding who should be allowed to own cars and how many cars"".
He added: ""The COE system should therefore remain market-based.""
But why this change of heart, in considering the proposal?
Observers see a confluence of factors.
Public transport infrastructure did not keep up with the influx of foreign workers, resulting in packed travel even as the ageing MRT system broke down more frequently.
Then, at the General Election in May 2011, policies of the ruling People's Action Party took a beating.
Once seen as primarily market-driven in its policies, the Government now wants to make clear that social equity is a priority as well, including middle-class concerns about living costs and competition for jobs.
Exacerbating this is the politics of envy. It is not helped by some of the new rich appearing to be ""more in your face"" in displaying their wealth by racing flashy cars on the road or expecting others to give way to them.
Dr Koh identifies the politics of envy as a challenge for politicians: ""Do we cut the tall poppy when these represent the wealth creators of our economy, or if they move here as tycoons, then they are folks who are served by the wealth managers who in turn are the bright young PMETs (professionals, managers, executives and technicians)?""
For now, until public transport becomes a viable alternative to the car, the divergent definitions of fairness in car ownership will continue to be a policy road bump.
In the larger context of the widening income gap and whether the middle class is being looked after, any misstep in political calculations will see a blowback at the polls.
Going by the current climate, the decision may well be in line with the record of the past 20 years: Something that caters to those who feel fairness is about making car ownership accessible to all - or at least, the middle-income bracket.

Find 'fairer way' to give everyone a chance to own a car
-- ST PHOTO: RAJ NADARAJAN
ADMIN executive Kwan Jin Peng, 25, believes the well-off in Singapore should pay more for their second car.
He also supports suggestions to re-categorise car COEs so that luxury cars are better segregated from cheaper ones.
This would help address the aggrieved feelings of middle-income Singaporeans who want a car but find the COE premiums beyond their reach.
He says: ""The Government should come up with a fairer way to let Singaporeans get a chance to own a car.""
Mr Kwan, who is single and lives with his parents in a five-room flat in Woodlands, has no immediate plans to
buy a car but hopes to have his own set of wheels in five years or so.
He reckons that nearly half of his friends have aspirations to own a car.
He says: ""I don't need a car to be fulfilled. If it's within my means, I will try to own one.""

Owning a car is a luxury, not a necessity
-- ST PHOTO: CAROLINE CHIA
OIL trader David Goh, 52, supports the idea of making people pay more for a second or third car to give some sense of fairness, but he is not doing so in support of middle-class aspirations to own a car.
He actually thinks a car is a luxury - although it is one he himself can afford.
He points out that, by his estimates, car owners fork out $1,500 a month on petrol, road tax, Electronic Road Pricing charges, carpark fees and insurance.
He adds: ""People say, have a special COE category for those who need one. But how do you justify who is needy?
"" Some people earning $3,000-$4,000 a month want to buy a car because they need it to transport their children to school. But it's a burden to buy one. How do you draw the line?""
He drives a three-year-old Mercedes-Benz E200, which he bought for $210,000, and lives in a corner terrace house in the Holland Road area with his wife, 49, and children aged 16 and 18.
He says: ""If you own more cars, you bear an additional burden. And an average-income family has to think twice about the economics before plunging into (owning a car). Sometimes, it's better to look at car sharing.""

MR RAYMOND Koh Bock Swi's call for Singaporeans to fill top jobs in the banking sector is very troubling (""Ways to strengthen Singapore core in banking""; last Thursday).
This is no less than discrimination, and violates one of Singapore's most cherished cultural values - that of meritocracy. Merit alone should determine who leads any commercial organisation.

Offer perks to regular blood donors
I RECENTLY received an SMS from the Bloodbank urging me to donate blood as it was short of type B+ blood.
On a weekday last week, I went to its centre in Woodlands to do so, and found that there were hardly any blood donors. Why are people not coming forward to do something that can save lives?
The Health Sciences Authority used to have a scheme whereby regular blood donors could receive free medical treatment at polyclinics, but this initiative was scrapped.
I am sure most people donate blood not because of such an incentive, but it would be a good way to show appreciation to them.
I hope the authorities can consider this and maybe offer even more incentives to blood donors.

Concern over coffee shop's record resale price
I READ with concern Monday's report (""HDB coffee shop in Hougang sold for record $23.8m"").
Such extraordinary prices for an HDB commercial space worry me as high resale prices may lead to rent increases, and ultimately costlier food and drinks. Ordinary folk who patronise the coffee shop end up being the losers.
HDB spaces should be sold back to the Housing Board, which can act as the clearing authority, especially when subsidies were provided in the original sales.
Otherwise, we would all be the poorer in time to come.

","   MR MICHAEL Dee (""Nationality-based hiring goes against meritocracy""; Wednesday) should know that Mr Raymond Koh Bock Swi's call for Singaporeans to fill top jobs in the banking sector (""Ways to strengthen Singapore core in banking""; June 27) followed a similar one by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam last month (""'Crucial that S'pore core can land top banking jobs'""; June 17).
Foreigners have made significant contributions to Singapore's economic progress. However, the significant number of foreigners - their economic contributions notwithstanding - in senior-level and middle-management positions in Singapore across various industries, such as banking, has led to a perceptible feeling of a glass ceiling and, separately, insecurity among many Singaporeans over their job and career prospects.
Mr Koh's letter does not evince a rejection of meritocracy, but reflects what Singaporeans of all political hues recognise - that Singapore's pro-business and foreign-talent-friendly policies must not come at the cost of capable and deserving Singaporeans facing lacklustre career and job opportunities in their own country.
Rather than raise the alarmist scenario of relocating elsewhere, foreign businesses should look towards tailoring their human resource policies to fit the local socio-political realities of today, not yesteryear. This can be done without alienating foreign employees or giving Singaporeans an unfair advantage that would ultimately be to their detriment.
For example, businesses should adopt a ""Singaporean-first"" hiring policy before considering non-Singaporean applicants. Career advancement options that can assure qualified Singaporeans of jobs at the upper management levels, and training opportunities for locals to improve their career prospects, must be introduced.
Foreign businesses that adopt such practices are likely to earn considerable goodwill from Singaporeans, attract better-qualified Singaporean applicants, and be seen to be among the better employers in Singapore.
This will also serve a major corollary function in arresting perceptions of xenophobia and a Singaporean-foreigner divide.

In Singapore, banking is a mature industry, and we are a key international financial hub. So we do not lack a competent, experienced and highly educated workforce in this sector.
Legislation is recommended to ensure that there is no glass ceiling for career progression and every opportunity is given to enable Singaporean bank executives to progress based purely on their talent, experience and potential.
This is even more important for our local banks as vulnerability of the banking industry can wreak economic havoc in a country.
There is no question that selecting Singaporeans for top banking jobs based on their race, religion or family connections is simply not the Singapore way.
The law is required to ensure a level playing field for locals. That is why there are similar protective regulations in places like London, Hong Kong and Australia, which require banks operating there to prove that they have exhausted the search for local talent before they can hire foreigners.
This is not an unreasonable proposition and certainly will not inhibit progressive-thinking foreign banks from coming to our country to do business.

Nurturing philanthropy and curbing a creeping sense of entitlement make sense.
Philanthropy - asking the rich to give to the poor - alone may not be the answer as it will not be sustainable. Any charity will tell you that each year, more money is needed than in the previous year.
What the poor really need is inspiration and encouragement. They need to be taught how to fish instead of being given fish.
We have millionaires in our midst who have gone through hard times but made the grade. In our society, there are many bankrupts who have made good.
These people can share their wealth of experience and inspire their fellow Singaporeans who are not as well-off.

The environment shapes who we are as a people.
In Singapore, the adoption of meritocracy since the founding of the nation started the removal of racial and other barriers to societal growth.
People of all races here learnt to work, live and thrive together.
Opportunities to interact abound, and the interracial comfort level increases.
Our leaders wisely laid the foundation for racial harmony by creating a positive environment for growth. It is therefore our duty to preserve and strengthen the system to continue to foster racial harmony.
Human dynamics play a part. We move and make friends within our social circle. The more racially diverse a social circle is, the more likely friendships will form across races.
For this to happen, education has to be the game-changer.
We should continue to provide opportunities for our young people of all races to excel in education.
As they climb the social ladder together, they will forge closer bonds among themselves - regardless of race and other differences.
One can truly be inspired by a friend of another race by increasing the depth of engagement.
This has to be a conscious effort as it will involve heart-to-heart talks, family visits and sharing mutual hobbies.
It is about digging into the soul of a friend and appreciating his perspective about life and the world.

It is refreshing to read that a larger number of young, more well-off Singaporeans have friends of a different race (""Who has a friend from another race?""; last Saturday).
Singapore's success has been built on the mutual respect that exists among the different races and ethnic groups.

","   IT IS ironic that on the one hand, Malaysia spends millions to attract its talented people to return home, but on the other hand, denies some of its brightest students the courses and universities of their choice.
This annual season of silliness will only force high-performing students to look elsewhere to further their studies.
One obvious benefactor is Singapore, which offers Malaysian students scholarships, living allowances and an attractive multi-cultural environment to study in. Eventually, after graduation, jobs are offered too.
The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) and Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) have kicked up a storm, and rightly so, over the drop in placements. The government has said a decision is pending.
But why deny Malaysia's top students the courses of their choice in the first place? Why allow this mockery to take place year in, year out?
Why put them through this harrowing experience, which must surely test the limits of their love for their country.
The MCA, in particular, wants to know why there is a low intake of Chinese students - 7,913 successful applicants out of 41,573 for 20 public universities this year.
Its education bureau chairman, Dr Wee Ka Siong, revealed shocking figures that show Malaysian Chinese students intake at a mere 19 per cent of the total for the new academic term.
In previous years and since meritocracy in the university intake was introduced from 2002, the Chinese student intake had not dropped below 25 per cent.
Apart from the ethnic Chinese students, there were 30,903 bumiputeras (Malays and indigenous groups), 1,824 Indians and 933 other races that made up the total number of successful applicants.
This state of affairs is completely unacceptable. It is unfair, and bright, young students should not be put through this.
Some students with a full cumulative grade point average, or CGPA, of 4.0 were not only denied courses of their choice, but also places in universities. They had selected medicine, pharmacy and dentistry as their top choices, followed by accountancy and engineering. As for the 19 per cent of successful Chinese students, many are not happy with the courses they were given.
It was to avoid this unhappy situation that the government implemented a meritocracy policy in 2002. Subsequently, the Chinese student intake had always been above 20 per cent, whereas the Indians averaged 9 per cent.
These students are a talent pool that would do the nation proud in years to come.
Even Dr Wee expressed worry that Singapore would be the main beneficiary of this annual intake mess in Malaysian universities.
The government has to play an annual balancing game, practising meritocracy while giving the underprivileged a chance at high-value courses.
We are not against social engineering, but these efforts at giving the underprivileged a chance should not cost us in terms of meritocracy.
Some of the students are poor and underprivileged and hope to use education as a ladder to climb out of poverty.
They have put in years of hard work, poring over textbooks, going for tuition and preparing for the big STPM (pre-university) examination.
At the end of the day, they hope to secure a course of study of their choice and even a university of their choice.
In this respect, the government should do everything possible to ensure that the selection process is transparent and accountable.
Currently, the selection process for the 20 public universities is opaque. We don't know how and who select the students or the qualifying criteria.
We are just told that the students are judged based on their examination results (90 per cent) and extra-curricular activities (10 per cent).
The onus lies with the government to explain the record low number of seats given to Chinese and Indian students in the new intake for public universities.
There is no point dredging the world for Malaysian talent and spending money to urge them to return while allowing our young and bright, at the same time, to go without a university education, especially when Malaysia's neighbours are looking out for talented Malaysian youth.

","   THE main pipeline of Singapore's top echelons of civil service - the Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarship - is drawing from more diverse sources, and this change may be happening faster than many Singaporeans imagine.
In an interview with The Straits Times, PSC chairman Eddie Teo reveals that just 60 per cent of this year's scholars hail from Raffles Institution and Hwa Chong Institution, down from 82 per cent in 2007.
Mr Teo sheds light on how diversity is now a big part of PSC's work in selecting scholars and promoting top civil servants.
He was speaking in the same week the PSC announced that its new batch of scholars included five polytechnic graduates - the highest number in recent years - and, for the first time, two School of the Arts graduates.Why is diversity important?
The Singapore population is becoming more diverse. Public servants need to reflect the population and be able to understand the ground well. If you just have one kind of people in the public service and another kind of people in the population, there's going to be a disjuncture.
The nature of our problems has also become more complex. You need people with different abilities to address the issues.
For these reasons, we decided that diversity is important.
That's not to say that we have set quotas. Rather, you find that as our society changes, the people who appear before us also change. And you seize the opportunity and appoint the right people with the right fit to the public sector.When, roughly, did this shift in thinking happen?
If you look at the numbers, for instance, the year before I took over as PSC chairman - 2007 - some 82 per cent of our scholars came from Raffles Junior College (now known as Raffles Institution) and Hwa Chong Institution. This year, about 60 per cent are from Hwa Chong and Raffles.
This does not mean that Hwa Chong's and Raffles' standards have dropped. The education system has produced good schools like Dunman High School, Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), River Valley High, NUS High. And they are giving the two top schools a run for their money.
In 2009, we also started to engage schools more actively. I suspect there was, in the past, a degree of self-disqualification by students, who think: ""Why apply? They only choose Hwa Chong and Raffles students.""
So we persuaded schools to persuade students to apply. We met them and asked them what kind of problems they had and why they didn't submit applications before. We assured them that we were serious about wanting diversity and people with qualities apart from academic results.
Then, we began to see applications from schools that never applied before. And we actually gave them scholarships. So slowly, the feeling is beginning to spread that you don't have to come from Hwa Chong and Raffles to apply.Some people might ask if this emphasis on diversity means we trade off on ability.
Diversity doesn't mean no ability. Diversity means different abilities. We're still looking for people with the qualities we were looking for before - people who are not just top academically, but who also have integrity, commitment, empathy and leadership.
For instance, in the recent batch, there was one very interesting guy who grew up in Papua New Guinea. He's got a different experience. Now, I'm not saying that anybody with a strange background will make a good public servant. He's also a very able guy and did well in school. So we don't just pick people with strange backgrounds. They've got to have strange backgrounds plus all the other things.Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam recently spoke on the need to ensure a continuous meritocracy - that we take a risk with people who have not done as well in the early stages.
I agree. Which is why we never assume that the PSC is faultless, or that it knows exactly which 18-year-old will make it as permanent secretary in 20 years' time. We assume that sometimes people fall through the cracks. We didn't look at them before.
Partly it's a practical problem. You can lower the bar, but if you make (it) so low, you will be faced with 20,000 people to interview, and you can't do it. So you have to set a bar. But you ensure that later on, (those) you miss have another shot. In 2007, we started giving mid-term scholarships to people who had begun their university studies. In 2008, we started giving out master's scholarships. These people may not have applied previously for various reasons - their grades were not good enough, or they knew nothing about government service, or they didn't want to be bonded. But after a few years they decide that maybe it's a good thing. We'll look at them. The wonderful thing is that the people who then apply at that stage - say, 20 years old instead of 18 - really want to join the public service. At 18, you may not be sure.
We also have a programme called green harvest: opportunities for people in the private sector. They join either the management associates programme (MAP - the primary route to the Administrative Service), or the Administrative Service, depending on their seniority. Last year, 19 per cent of MAP inflow was from the open market. This was a peak.
Of course, the numbers are not large, because if you are really good, and you are doing well outside government, why would you want to join the public sector? Unless you feel burnt out. And then you say, I'll give it a try.
Some don't fit in because cultures differ. They may be used to the way things work in the private sector but now they've got to seek approval from so many departments and bosses, and it's difficult to adjust. But for those who adjust and stay on, this is another way of increasing diversity.
In the service, if you're not in the MAP or the Administrative Service, but you show excellence, your name will be put up. It may take you longer, but if you're interviewed and considered good enough, you are brought into the Administrative Service.Is there anyone whom you would say was your best bet?
I have been PSC chairman for only five years. For me to see results, I need 10, 15, 20 years. If I make a bet now, give him a scholarship, it takes a long time to prove me right or wrong.That is the nature of PSC's work, isn't it? It's long-term.
Yes. And you can say that of many domains. We do the best we can in selecting the right people. The rest depends on the system, the organisation, the process of nurturing and the people themselves. You may choose somebody who's good but miss something about his character, for instance, and he gets derailed along the way because of some flaw.
Or some people find that this is not the life for them. And I don't agonise over that because, for me, the important thing is fit. If people leave for the right reasons, they stay in Singapore and contribute to Singapore, that's fine.But there's still a sense that he took up a place that could have been given to someone else.
That's a misperception. There is no quota. That is why we had 92 PSC scholars this year and 62 last year. I'm not trying to meet a number. If this year there are 92 good people, we give 92 scholarships. Last year there were only 62, so we gave 62. Next year, it may go down or may go up again. Of course, I don't think we will ever give 500 top-tier PSC scholarships. Singapore is small and the pool is small.One view out there is that in recent years, with families becoming more affluent, more parents can afford to send their children abroad to study, and therefore it is becoming harder for PSC to attract the top talent.
It is not necessarily a bad thing. If you go with your parents' money, it is because you want to have your options open. You don't want to join the public service. In the past, there would have been people who applied for the wrong reasons: It is prestigious or they wanted to go overseas, even though they didn't really want to join the public service.
My concern is: Of the top five to 10 people from each JC (junior college), are many of them still applying to PSC? The answer is yes. The interest from that top tier has been maintained.

","   Two entrenched schemes are testimony to the deep concern Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong has for the welfare of Singaporeans, said Professor Tan Ser Kiat, president of the Singapore Medical Council.
These are Medisave and Edusave.
Medisave, introduced in 1984 when Mr Goh was Second Minister for Health, is a national medical savings scheme in which people set aside part of their income to meet future hospitalisation, day surgery and outpatient expenses.
Reading a citation last night for Mr Goh's award from his alma mater, Raffles Institution (RI), to honour his contributions to society, Prof Tan called Medisave a ""revolutionary and innovative concept"" in Singapore's health-care financing co-payment policy.
In setting up Edusave to fund enrichment activities for children, Mr Goh ""tried to ensure a level playing field for all"", he noted.
Edusave was introduced in 1993, and two years later, Edusave Merit Bursaries were given to bright but needy students.
When Mr Goh was Singapore's Prime Minister between 1990 and 2004, he brought a ""new leadership style that was more inclusive, consultative and open and ensured that policies are made with inputs from all sectors of society"", Prof Tan noted.
Mr Goh's humility and caring nature were legendary, added the orthopaedic surgeon, citing an incident during a visit the then-PM made to his clinic in the late 1990s.
They had heard a loud noise and saw Mr Goh's security officer had fainted and cut himself on the lip.
Mr Goh helped him up, arranged for him to be admitted to hospital and accompanied him to the ward to ensure he was taken care of, Prof Tan recalled.
And a few weeks ago, he added, Mr Goh helped raise about $800,000 for Canossaville Children's Home that had taken in two orphans from his ward in Marine Parade GRC.
These were among the highlights of the citation, underlining a point raised by RI principal Lim Lai Cheng in her speech at the school's 190th anniversary dinner.
She said she wished to see in all Rafflesians ""a heart of gratitude instead of a sense of entitlement"", and a sense of social responsibility at the core of a Raffles education.
Mr Goh, in his speech later, urged Singaporeans to guard against elitism and give back to society.
His call resonated with Rafflesians like Dr Lim Kuo-Yi, 44, chief executive officer of Infocomm Investments, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore's venture capital arm.
Dr Lim, from the class of 1987, mentors students in entrepreneurship: ""I truly believe in entrepreneurship being the tool to ensure success, regardless of background.""
Another Rafflesian, Mr Colin Low, 37, director of business development at Frasers Hospitality, said he and a few school mates got their class of 1992 together last year to raise $30,000 for RI, specially for needy students.
Current and former politicians at the dinner also shared Mr Goh's social concerns.
Workers' Party MP Png Eng Huat, 51, from the class of 1977, encouraged students to help in his Hougang ward to give back to society. He believes integration should start at a young age, in schools: ""That's the best time to weed out elitism.""
Former presidential candidate and MP Tan Cheng Bock, 73 - whom Mr Goh described in his speech as one who ""stood for the underdog and still does"" - returned the compliment, saying his ""good friend"" is a genuine person who cares for Singapore.

Beware of elitism
""When society's brightest and most able think that they made good because they are inherently superior and entitled to their success; when they do not credit their good fortune also to birth and circumstance; when economic inequality gives rise to social immobility and a growing social distance between the winners of meritocracy and the masses; and when the winners seek to cement their membership of a social class that is distinct from, exclusive, and not representative of Singapore society - that is elitism.""
MR GOH, in his speech last night
Adapt, strengthen meritocracy
""We must adapt and strengthen our practice of meritocracy to ensure that it continues to benefit the whole of society, and not just those who are bright and able. The solution is not to hold back the able or pull down those who have succeeded. Nor is it to replace meritocracy with another system - there is no better and fairer alternative.""

","   The danger of Singapore's best and brightest young people thinking they are naturally superior and entitled to their success worries Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.
Singapore needs to guard against such elitism in schools, public institutions or society at large, because it can divide the inclusive society the country is trying to build, he said yesterday.
To guard against that, he recommended sticking with meritocracy, which has served the country well. But there is a need to adapt and strengthen meritocracy to ensure everyone in society benefits.
""What we need is to get the successful to understand that they have a responsibility to help the less fortunate and less able with compassion,"" he said. They can do this through cash donations, sharing skills and knowledge, and serving the country.
At the same time, the Government needs to continue to help families that have fallen behind, through its policies and programmes, he added.
""Together, these efforts will ensure that our brand of meritocracy remains compassionate, that it is fair and inclusive for all - not just those who are lucky in their backgrounds or genetic endowments.""
He was speaking at the 190th anniversary dinner of his alma mater, Raffles Institution, which honoured him with the Gryphon Award for distinguished alumni. It is named after the mythical creature on the school crest.
He is the second recipient after former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew in 2011, who had urged RI then to maintain its longstanding traditions of meritocracy and multiculturism.
Mr Goh made a similar call yesterday, saying: ""Our top schools, including RI, must play a key role in ensuring that elitism and a sense of entitlement do not creep into the minds of their students.
""Those of us who have benefited disproportionately from society's investment in us owe the most to society, particularly to those who may not have had access to the same opportunities. We owe a debt to make lives better for all, and not just for ourselves.""
Recalling his schooldays more than half a century ago when RI was in Bras Basah, Mr Goh, 72, said it was then a melting pot of the best male pupils from primary schools all over Singapore, boys of different races and religions, rich and poor.
Like him, most were poor or from lower-income homes, and meritocracy worked for them, leading them into the top boys' school.
But as society matured and became more stratified, families who had done well could give their children a head start.
""It is not surprising that many who have not done so well see meritocracy as a system that is biased towards those with better resources, and one which impairs their social mobility,"" he said.
He recalled that as far as 30 years ago, Singapore's leaders recognised such downsides of meritocracy.
He had listened in as then PM Lee, in a discussion with Dutch economist Albert Winsemius and then labour MP Devan Nair, argued that ideally and philosophically, all wealth should revert to the state on the owner's death so that each successive generation would start on an equal footing, and success would depend on hard work and ability, not inherited wealth.
But that idea was impractical, Mr Goh recalled.
Instead, the Government has tried to level the playing field by putting more resources into education, including pre-schools, and giving financial aid to needy students.
Mr Goh also launched a Raffles Community Initiative to provide seed money for students, alumni and parents to do community projects locally and in the region.

","   A RECENT run of comments from establishment giants suggests that left-leaning ideas, held down for so long, may finally be in the ascendant again.
In April, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam raised more than a few eyebrows when he said the Cabinet, which was ""centrist"" when he entered politics in 2001, had crept leftward in recent years.
""You still get diversity of views in Cabinet but the centre of gravity is left of centre,"" he said.
Until last week, one may have read this as a generational shift.
Hard-headed People's Action Party (PAP) leaders, a version of the theory goes, who had their hands on the steering wheel during the 1980s and 1990s saw first-hand how wildly successful Singapore was when free markets were allowed to work their magic.
After 2000, however, some of them began to make way for younger leaders like Mr Tharman, and a greater mix of political ideas entered the party - hence that growing desire to moderate the excesses of economic conservatism.
This theory died a fairly thorough death last week when a foremost member of that so-called hard-headed generation - Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong - made a big speech on elitism that would have set the hearts of many social democrats racing.
Speaking at his alma mater, Raffles Institution, a symbol of academic accomplishment in Singapore, he became the first PAP leader in a very long time to argue that success was dependent on that four-letter word: luck.
To be sure, he was quoting America's Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke, who told students at Princeton University - a symbol of academic accomplishment in the United States - that meritocracy simply meant the ""luckiest"" people reaped the largest rewards. The luckiest, that is, in terms of family support and encouragement, and ""in so many other ways too difficult to enumerate"", Mr Bernanke said.
But Mr Goh was clearly quoting in order to agree with the general thrust of the assessment.
This linking of luck and success is not insignificant.
Mr Goh does recount a story from 1980 of former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew arguing privately with economic adviser to Singapore Albert Winsemius and former president Devan Nair that for the state to seize all of an individual's wealth upon death was ideal on a philosophical level.
But such radical ideas have not generally been aired in public.
Instead, the PAP narrative used for years to shore up its meritocratic argument has insisted that success is primarily, if not entirely, dependent on hard work, skill and education.
And since no segment of society had a monopoly on these commodities, those who ended up at the top must have done so fairly.
By throwing luck into the equation, Mr Goh's speech at least asks questions about the original premise on what brings success to individuals - therefore casting doubt too on the logical deductions building up from that premise.
Alas, left-leaning Singaporeans must not get all excited yet.
Notable as this latest speech is, it must be pointed out that what Mr Goh meant by luck is very different from what others may mean.
Mr Goh is referring to the luck of birth. If you happen to enter the world in a prosperous family, you are far more likely to be disproportionately well- equipped to succeed. Think Eton House, speech and drama classes, overseas exposure from young, tuition teachers, and so on.
But when you do succeed later in life, it is still due to hard work, skill and education. You just had a bigger endowment of skill and education to start you off.
Many social democrats, however, would argue that even success later in life is very much luck-dependent.
For many people are hardworking, skilled and well-educated, but few among them can hope to become rich and successful. The best pianist or novelist or actor in the world is not that much better in playing, writing or acting than his peers in the top tier, but makes much more money.
Even in academic citations, where luck might not appear important, one theory posits that one's work may be widely cited because of where it appears in the bibliography of academic papers. And beyond a certain critical mass of citations, people cite you more or less automatically, without having read what you wrote.
Luck is what makes all the difference, the left-leaning aver.
The prescribed solutions by the two views of luck are also quite different, as can be expected.
Mr Goh's view requires the state to intervene more aggressively in the early stages to erase some of the disadvantages from the lack of luck at birth.
The latter view, however, requires nothing less than significant redistribution. Since you didn't really deserve all that money you made - you just happened to be at the right place at the right time - you are obliged to return a large portion of it to society.
And so, even though the signs do suggest that the PAP has moved to the left, as Mr Tharman has observed, and this move does not appear to be restricted to any particular generation of PAP leaders, there will still be some on the left dissatisfied with the magnitude of the shift.
The dissatisfied, however, may be hoping for too much. The gains made by their ideological camp in recent years are already very considerable.
And even with scepticism of capitalism peaking worldwide, the reality is that a small economy wholly dependent on global trade and open borders has limited scope for implementing the kind of social democratic programme they ultimately want.

Search for S'pore spirit
SINGAPOREANS who lived through Aug 9, 1965, remember the confusion of independence, which also sparked many episodes of neighbourliness and community spirit. Singapore today is wealthier and more individualistic. Expect more ideological battles as the city-state matures, says university dean Barry Desker.
What it takes to be one united people
The practice of meritocracy has been under scrutiny as Singapore society copes with growing inequality. Its standing as a principle of governance is firm but the country has to guard against ill effects such as elitism.

""We are in the midst of finalising some of the possibilities and should be able to provide more details in the coming months,"" Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin said in a written reply yesterday.
But he made clear the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) planned framework is to ensure a level playing field and maintain meritocracy, and will not be a ""magic bullet that ensures Singaporeans are hired first for every job"".
He was responding to Nominated MP Mary Liew, Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) and Mr Patrick Tay (Nee Soon GRC), who had filed questions on foreign labour policy and the need to ensure fair consideration by bosses.
During this year's Budget debate, Mr Tan had said his ministry was looking at measures to achieve the latter.
Yesterday, he said the framework must strike a balance between ensuring a fair chance for Singaporeans and not being too onerous on employers.
MOM has visited countries such as the United States, Canada, Britain and Germany to speak with officials, firms and labour unions, he said.
Representatives from the Singapore National Employers Federation, National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore Business Federation tagged along.
A theme that emerged was that ""an overly onerous system could lead to unnecessary bureaucracy that affects competitiveness"", said Mr Tan.
MOM has also gathered views from the public and held focus groups with industry players and human resource practitioners, he added.

","   In a speech at the Singapore Corporate Awards 2013 held last Wednesday, Minister for Law and Foreign Affairs K. Shanmugam referred to how relentless globalisation has sharpened awareness everywhere about the impact of social forces, including gender and social inequalities. The edited excerpt here addresses social inequality, success and fairness, and what needs to be relooked.
RELENTLESS globalisation since 2009 has thrown up some phrases which keep coming up, which I think signal a larger trend in society.
The phrases are dual economy, widening income gap, the imperfections of meritocracy, the elite control of the economy, the 1per cent versus the 99 per cent, inequalities, inequities, the moral limits of the markets, market distortion and social injustice.
These are large social forces at play the world over which cannot and should not be ignored because they signal a real feeling of a significant section of society...
Let me move on to the issue of inequality; of inequality in general in society. The approach of complete free-market capitalisation was not something we have ever practised in Singapore in the way it has been practised say, in Hong Kong, or some other countries.
We have intervened in education, housing, health care and other areas. Over the last few years, undoubtedly with the growing income inequality, there is a mood in society which is less celebratory of success.
People question success more. There is a change in Singapore's society and we have to pay attention to this. And those who have succeeded, all of you here, have to think about this.
Otherwise, the pressures can build up that can seriously damage society. Increasingly, for example, questions are raised about something that has been a fundamental tenet for us: meritocracy. It's only one example.
Getting a fair shake
THERE are many other examples. But, fundamentally, if you think a little bit more, look at the questions that are raised: When people question meritocracy, they don't actually question meritocracy; they question the fairness of the system. Because underlying it, they don't believe they are getting a fair shake out of the system. And so, fairness is the key that runs through everything.
In that context, take the example of schooling - entry to desired primary and secondary schools. Many have commented that the existing structure favours those who are already well-off, who have succeeded. It's again only one example.
The sense of unfairness leads people then to question; and the sense of unfairness is coming from the fact that they can't get into schools because of some structure, alumni relationships or where (geographically) the school is located. Who can afford places near such schools? Who can afford to have one parent volunteering in such schools? This sense of unfairness leads people to question meritocracy as a whole.
What I think the answer is, is to make sure that there is true equality of opportunities. This is fundamental.
And we have to try and achieve that. It's not good for society - including for those who have succeeded - if the system is seen as unfair or not providing equal opportunities. One of the most important elements in a child's success, I think most of us know, is the quality time that parents spend with their children and how they spend it.
Middle-class parents tend to, as a general rule, provide a lot of quality time. And their children obviously benefit from that. The state cannot do much about that, about the outcomes that come from that.
Issues to think about
BUT we can look at other areas, and where we can create a more even field, we should and we will do so. For example, the state can play an important role in providing quality pre-schooling for the less well-off. I emphasise that this is only one example.
These are issues that I think we need to think about. In the same way, if you talk about globalisation and the resultant wage pressures, how has that impacted people?
We had the Our Singapore Conversation over the last year, with views from more than 40,000 people. There is a strong desire for security, peace of mind. There is a whole range of issues, from health care and housing to many others.
If you ask the elderly, for example, they are concerned about the cost of health care. People want a social contract which is worked around these concerns. We in Singapore have to pull together as one on this. The Government's essential philosophy all these years has been that that social contract must be to take care of people's needs in specific areas, to help them achieve their full potential, achieve their best without seriously impacting or killing off the work ethic and individual enterprise. As our external environment changes, with the pressures of globalisation, we need to relook the safety nets.
We have to consider carefully people's concerns and relook that social contract while remaining true to the fundamental philosophy that has guided us.
We have to adapt, as the world changes and as the needs of Singaporeans change. One cannot be dogmatic about it. That's the only way for Singapore to succeed, and for all of you to succeed.
Those in this room, you have succeeded. You will also have to play a bigger role in this new social contract. It is not possible for you to do well if the 99 per cent are unhappy and feel unfairly treated. Thankfully, we have not reached that situation, unlike in some countries. We must avoid that outcome.

His pragmatic and enlightened approach envisages a relook at policies and procedures, taking on board the strengths and talents of Singaporeans from diverse walks of life, as well as the concerns and aspirations of the less well-off.
Acknowledging the growing income inequality caused by a pedantic adherence to the tenets of meritocracy designed by the State in its original form, his new approach will no doubt forge a more humane and compassionate dimension to problems that Singaporeans face daily.
It must be appreciated, however, that the Government's aim cannot be achieved unless Singaporeans come forward and cooperate.
Watching the National Day Parade last Friday, I was moved by the united and cohesive harmony the participants displayed. A deep sense of pride and belonging took hold of me and made me realise how lucky I was to be living in Singapore.
The parade clearly showed that we are one united people regardless of race, language or religion.
While individualism is understandably rising in Singapore, as it is in countries around the world, I have no doubt that the colourful multiracial and multicultural fabric of our society will prevail with greater intensity and passion in the years to come.
To render this possible, we have to get into the kampung spirit and work towards greater integration, compassion, graciousness and consideration for our fellow Singaporeans as well as the foreigners in our midst.

"," Public housing; Prices; Inventory; Affordable housing
","   At last year's National Day Rally, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong launched a national conversation about Singapore's future. This year, he has signalled a shift in approach that will see the Government playing a bigger role to build a fair and just society. Robin Chan and Andrea Ong highlight the big concerns in four areas where change is likely.
HOUSING: Keeping homes affordable for all
A BUOYANT property market has seen resale Housing Board flat prices rack up double-digit percentage hikes over the past few years, and an executive condominium (EC) even hit $2 million.
It has all come to a head for the public housing market, with Singaporeans questioning whether it is still serving its social purpose, or needs to be drastically revamped.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin said: ""Property prices have run away from wage growth and the younger generation is having a hard time coping.""
The Government has responded to keep prices for first-time buyers affordable. It has delinked Build-to-Order (BTO) flats from the market since 2011 by varying the discounts for buyers to keep prices stable, and bringing more than 110,000 new flats on stream in the next three years.
National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan has promised to lower the prices of flats in non-mature estates to four times applicants' annual household median income - they were 5 1/2 times the annual household median income last year.
Data from the HDB website shows that last year, the median monthly household income of a four-room flat applicant was $4,100, and $5,800 for a five-room flat applicant.
This would imply target prices of $197,000 and $278,000 for four- and five-room BTO flats after housing grants. That would be less than up to $300,000 and $400,000 that BTO four-room and five-room flats have been selling for recently.
But the question is how this can be sustained in the long term.
Holland-Bukit Timah GRC MP Liang Eng Hwa said short-term concerns arising from housing imbalances in supply and demand will be addressed.
But maintaining affordability is the longer-term and more fundamental problem - that is, whether median income can keep up with the rise in asset prices.
""If we see public housing as an essential social need, then we have to delink the way we price our new BTO flats from the market, as incomes don't necessarily correlate closely with property prices,"" he said. ""Public housing needs to stay affordable to low- and middle-income Singaporeans, regardless of property cycles.""
There have been many ideas proposed, including having shorter leases, relooking the way flats are priced, or having a larger pool of rental flats. But some of these measures have implications for existing home owners, who fear that a crash in property prices will erode their hard-earned savings. Many Singaporeans continue to hope their first home can serve as an investment for them.
Government Parliamentary Committee for National Development chairman Lee Bee Wah suggested that giving more grants, especially to buyers of three-room and four-room flats, may be the more palatable way forward.
Mr Liang said to manage stability in prices, the Government could look at building a small reserve inventory of some new and resale units. These could be released to the market should prices run ahead of where the Government believes they should be. He said: ""Having price stability for public housing will give first-time home buyers peace of mind. Having an inventory would also shorten waiting time for the flat.""
Dr Chua said ""the bottom line is that the Government will have to spend more"".
More fundamental questions about public housing are being asked as society's needs evolve.
Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC MP Hri Kumar Nair said a flat should not be treated as an investment. ""We need to go back to the basics of public housing. I would therefore increase the Minimum Occupation Period and bar such HDB owners from owning private property. Those who own or want to own private property do not need public housing,"" he said.
Centennial Asia Advisors economist Manu Bhaskaran said more rental flats should be provided to low-income families at subsidised levels. He said: ""The poorer segments of our population would then not have to worry about a huge debt that they have to take on and can allocate a higher portion of their incomes on spending that would boost their kids' life chances.""

EDUCATION: Primary woes over registration, PSLE
PANIC, anguish, relief and sometimes anger. These are the emotions that recur each year - during the annual Primary 1 registration season.
And as soon as it ends, students and parents of another age group face a second perennial high-stress exercise - the PSLE.
The parents and students are different each year, but they all experience the same roller coaster of emotions.
These two annual events have become symbols of an education system that many believe needs reform, as income inequality widens, social mobility slows, and aspirations evolve and alter the expectations of what an education should provide.
Increasingly more calls are being made for changes to relieve the stresses on students taking high-stakes exams, to make education opportunities equal from the time students are young, and to broaden the paths to success.
These are not just gripes of students and stressed-out parents. They are fundamental challenges to Singapore's long-held belief in meritocracy.
Summarising the challenges, Mr Hri Kumar Nair, MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, said: ""It is very difficult and unrealistic to remove the stress and competition in the system... What we can and should do is to ensure that every child starts from about the same point so that the race is not lost even before it has begun... We must ensure as best as we can that success is dependent on hard work and application.""
The Government has already taken action on many concerns over the education system in the past year. Education Minister Heng Swee Keat removed banding and ranking of secondary schools, and has pledged to ""make every school a good school"".
More recently, the Government has piloted five government-run pre-schools, raised funding to pre-schools and is expanding the number of anchor operators - mass market pre-schools that get government grants. Yet major concerns still remain, such as the emphasis on academic grades as the be-all and end-all of a student's success.
Said Mr Lim Biow Chuan, chairman of the government parliamentary committee for education: ""The call is really for less emphasis on pure academic grades in the PSLE and other exams. Is there a better way?""
Many parents have criticised the PSLE for placing unnecessary stress on children, as it decides which secondary school they will attend. Others, however, believe it helps to build up resilience.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong summed up the dilemma of the PSLE: ""We don't want to have excessive pressure... But we must not compromise our strengths in developing our children and in preparing (them) for the world, which is going to be very competitive, and for (their) jobs, which will not be easy.""
As he wrapped up the Our Singapore Conversation, Mr Heng indicated that there will be a change to the PSLE.
Some have also called for a review of Primary 1 registration, as they feel it benefits the wealthy and lessens mixing across social divides. Places at top schools fill up fast, with the first few phases for children of alumni, parent volunteers and those in clans, grassroots or church groups.
And the socio-economic gap is becoming accentuated.
Of the top six primary schools, only four in 10 pupils from these schools live in HDB flats - half the national average of eight in 10 pupils for all primary schools.
Mr Paul Sim wrote in The Straits Times Forum Page earlier this month that the present process, ""where alumni ties and affiliations to religious associations help children gain admission to popular schools, runs contrary to the principle of meritocracy"".
The challenges run deep in an education system that has, to many observers, benefited most Singaporeans and stood them in good stead in a competitive and globalised world. The goals remain the same, but the paths to get there must change.
Mr Heng said in a keynote speech at the Economic Society of Singapore last week: ""Our education system has to stay open and inclusive, develop each child to the fullest and focus on the competencies of the future.""

HEALTH CARE: Lightening burden of costs for elderly
THE twin spectres of rising medical costs and a greying population loom large on the landscape of Singapore's health care.
The cost of health care emerged as a particular area of concern for Singapore in a recent consumer trends study of 28 countries by research firm GfK.
The same worry is reflected in a report submitted by the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Health to the Ministry of Health this week. The committee called for rising costs to be managed through measures such as expanding the list of subsidised drugs and giving the public more information on private fees.
One group in particular has been singled out for attention: the ""pioneer generation"" of Singaporeans who may not have benefited fully from the national health- care financing schemes.
At least three ministers have signalled that the Government intends to do more to lighten the load of health-care costs for this group, in recognition of their sacrifices in the nation's younger days.
It is a welcome move for GPC chairman Lam Pin Min and member Chia Shi-Lu. Dr Chia hopes to see bigger subsidies tiered according to age and simpler delivery of measures so people do not feel ""there are so many hurdles to jump and forms to fill"".
Several larger issues have to be resolved, say experts such as health economist Phua Kai Hong, who sees a conflict in how the health-care sector has developed. It has to provide essential care, but in other areas, it is an industry where the market is left to set prices. The latter aspect has ""crept into"" the public sector, bringing costs up, he said.
The weaknesses of the existing framework, said principal consultant of Insights Health Associates Jeremy Lim, lie in the excessive use of co-payments for ""virtually all health conditions"" and inadequate financial protection against catastrophic illnesses. However, he stressed that any adjustment should retain positive elements like encouraging personal responsibility and prudent spending.
The GPC and Professor Phua also noted restrictions on how Medisave, the national medical savings scheme, can be used have led to the over-usage of acute care as people prefer staying in hospital - where they can use more of their Medisave - to other forms of community and step- down care.
The GPC is calling for the use of Medisave to be liberalised. To encourage people to stay healthy through prevention and early detection, they should be able to use Medisave for health screenings, essential dental procedures, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.
The differences in Medisave claim limits between hospitals and community care should also be removed so that it takes away the bottleneck and over-reliance on hospitals, said the GPC.
But Health Minister Gan Kim Yong has cautioned that while he is agreeable to extending Medisave, it should not be at the expense of depleting savings for future usage or for paying MediShield premiums.
For MediShield, however, the general sentiment is that there is scope for wider insurance coverage, such as removing the age limit of 90 and helping those who cannot afford the premiums to maintain their schemes.
Supporting this idea, Prof Phua said basic MediShield can be enhanced to provide compulsory coverage in catastrophic illnesses for all, moving away from integrated shield plans offered by private insurance companies which have fuelled perceptions of rising costs.
The GPC supports ""front-loading"", where people pay higher premiums when they are young to lighten the load on the old.
The Government has already indicated that it is increasing its expenditure on health care. It will also foot a larger portion of total health-care costs - 40 per cent, up from the current 30 per cent.
The health-care system also needs to ""elder-proof"" itself to ensure it is ready with facilities and networks, said observers.
Geriatrician Carol Tan-Goh from Raffles Hospital said people should be able to get subsidies for care programmes tailored to their wishes - even for home care - rather than getting the bulk of subsidies at the hospital. ""Don't just put the subsidy in the most expensive place. It should follow where the patient wants to go.""
ANDREA ONG
JOBS: Wage, competition concerns linger
IN SPITE of measures to slow the inflow of foreign workers and tighten the criteria for visas that skilled foreigners need to work in Singapore, worries over slow wage growth and unfair competition linger.
Wages for low-income workers are still rising slower than wages at the top, widening an already large income gap.
Last year, eight in 10 unionised companies followed a National Wages Council recommendation on wage rises for workers earning up to $1,000.
But for non-unionised firms, only three in 10 gave a raise of at least $50 as recommended. Four in 10 gave none at all.
The Government has identified some of the key challenges relating to foreign competition: employers who unfairly hire people from their own country; those who overlook Singaporeans in favour of foreigners in undue haste; and qualified foreigners who are willing to work at lower wages than local fresh graduates and mid-level PMEs.
Mr Inderjit Singh, MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC, said Singaporeans understand that foreigners complement the local workforce and do some jobs locals may lack experience for, but they cannot accept jobs that Singaporeans can do well going to foreigners due to liberal visa policies in the past.
Labour MP Patrick Tay said while these labour concerns did not appear to be highlighted in Our Singapore Conversation, he hopes ""there will be articulation by the Prime Minister at the National Day Rally on giving fair consideration for Singaporeans"".
The Government has, in fact, indicated it is looking at a framework to ensure fair hiring and will announce more details in the coming months.
Outlining the thinking behind this, Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin said: ""It is only fair and reasonable that foreign firms and foreigners working here bear a responsibility to the local communities.
""There must be equal opportunities for our people, whether at hiring or in advancement.""
But Mr Singh warned that while a Singaporean-first employment law should be implemented, ""we have to be careful not to overdo things such that companies find it too difficult to operate in Singapore"".
While the tightening of foreign worker inflows may help wages of Singaporeans rise faster than they have in the last decade, at the low end, more help is still needed.
The scope of the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme, which tops up wages of low-income workers, has been expanded, but Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin said that the Government has room to expand the scope of coverage.
A Progressive Wage Model has also been introduced by NTUC to better link wage increases to training for low-wage sectors.
The Government has also introduced a Wage Credit Scheme this year to boost productivity and wage increases.
But what the best way forward is remains contentious.
Economist and Emeritus Professor Lim Chong Yah had called for wage ""shock therapy"", suggesting lifting incomes at the bottom rapidly while freezing those at the top. Others believe a minimum wage needs to be adopted. Labour MP Zainal Sapari said: ""We need to take more decisive action in terms of helping low-wage workers earn better wages.""

","   Anyone who has followed recent Cabinet statements should expect substantial announcements in the Prime Minister's National Day Rally tonight.
In his National Day message, Mr Lee Hsien Loong said the Government will play a bigger role to build a fair and just society. ""We will do more to enable every Singaporean to succeed, through education and lifelong learning. We will keep avenues to rise wide open to all. We will help those from families with less get off to a good start in life, beginning from pre-school,"" he said.
""We will tackle the cost of living, for example health-care costs, especially for the elderly. We will foster a more equal society, by helping every family afford their own HDB flat, and giving low-income workers a better deal through Workfare. In Singapore, everyone will always have a stake in this country, and ample chances to make good in life.""
Singapore, the Prime Minister added, had to ""strike a new balance between the roles of the individual, the community and the state"".
He will likely elaborate tonight, but it sounds very much like the Government is ready to move decisively to address looming storm fronts.
Of course, what it touts as significant shifts may still fail to impress some sections. Effects of good policies typically take time to be felt on the ground, and programmes that cost hundreds of millions of dollars at the macro level can seem paltry when they trickle down to households.
This is why the People's Action Party (PAP) has always had an allergy to over-promising. When it advertises its goodies, it quickly magnifies the fine print to moderate expectations. We saw it again last week, when Mr Heng Swee Keat, overseeing the Our Singapore Conversation consultation process, sought to clarify that any ensuing changes had to fit a strategic long-term vision. Translation: We are not populist.
All these caveats aside, though, it is clear that the Government has for some years been grappling with fundamental challenges shared with other economically successful countries.
At its core, it is about an open economy that is extremely good at riding the forces of globalisation and rewarding those who are plugged in, but less capable of pulling along average and lower- income Singaporeans.
The gap has been growing, and in some sectors, particularly housing, it has become untenable. More worryingly, as the rich pull away from the rest, their willingness to accept redistribution may wane, as studies elsewhere have shown might happen. The Government may have come around to recognising that it is better to intervene sooner rather than later.
In recent months, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan has said that he wants to lower the prices of flats in non-mature estates to four times applicants' annual household median income, compared with the current 5.5 times. We can expect the Prime Minister to flesh out the promise of making housing affordable, with more grants perhaps to more households.
As for health care, there is no running away from the fact that an ageing society will impose strains on the system. Watch out for bold initiatives to relieve the anxieties over rising medical costs while preserving the essence of personal responsibility.
The Government has also indicated that there will be changes in the school system to make education less stressful and to create as many pathways to success as possible. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam has envisioned a continuous meritocracy with diverse definitions of success.
No matter what the Prime Minister and other ministers say, some listeners will be sceptical. This is a natural outcome of the polarised politics that Mr Lee also mentioned in passing in his National Day message. Critics will feel that the PAP knows it cannot just ignore Singaporeans' woes - not after the ruling party's setback in the 2011 General Election and this year's Punggol East by-election - but in the end it is all just lip service.
There is no doubt that recent ballots were a wake-up call, as acknowledged by the PAP's own ministers. But to be fair to the party, it started addressing the income gap before the 2011 GE. The most important departure from PAP orthodoxy to date - the Workfare income support scheme - was launched in 2007.
If the PAP has been too conservative, it is not because it is in denial, but because it has been wrestling with the challenge of developing solutions that are more than just short-term palliatives. It remains convinced that it must come up with a sustainable long-term model that does not compromise Singapore's core strengths as an open economy that rewards enterprise and effort.
But there are now signs that the Government is ready to do more to shed what some Singaporean economists have called its ""market fundamentalism"" - an unjustified faith in the untrammelled forces of supply and demand.
When this newspaper interviewed Mr Tharman in April, he spoke of such a shift, saying that the ""centre of gravity"" in Cabinet had moved ""left-of-centre"" compared with when he joined politics 11 years ago.
This would be in keeping with new thinking in economics, that intervening to moderate inequality isn't a soft-headed option but makes hardnosed economic sense.
In his book The Price Of Inequality, Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz talks about why capitalist societies need to pay attention to those who are struggling to get by. Investing more through education, technology and infrastructure and providing more security to ordinary citizens will lead to a more efficient and dynamic economy, he argues. The lack of opportunities for those at the bottom means their potential will go unfulfilled and they will never get a fair chance to break the cycle.
Professor Stiglitz is talking about the United States, and Singapore's situation is nowhere near as extreme, but the same logic applies.
In his 10-minute National Day message, a part of which I quoted earlier, PM Lee said the Government will try to ""foster a more equal society"". Tonight, he will have more than two hours to elaborate, and to persuade Singaporeans that his Government's vision is one that they can believe in. I am looking forward to it.

Taking the long view
If the PAP has been too conservative, it is not because it is in denial, but because it has been wrestling with the challenge of developing solutions that are more than just short-term palliatives. It remains convinced that it must come up with a sustainable long-term model that does not compromise Singapore's core strengths as an open economy that rewards enterprise and effort.

","   A DAY after the Prime Minister laid out a new way forward for Singapore, economists and politicians praised the shift for being a bold and necessary move in rebalancing the relationship between the State and the Singaporean.
But while Mr Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally (NDR) speech hit the right notes, the specific policy changes he announced drew a mixed reaction.
Some felt they were incremental rather than radical. Others said they were sparse on the numbers and details, leaving them guessing how much of an impact the changes would make and who would foot the bill of say, the new MediShield Life health insurance scheme.
Still, the changes show that the Government recognises the need to adapt its policies to a changing context for Singapore, said senior fellow and economist Donald Low of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.
""We have recalibrated the balance between the State, the market and the individual. The orientation is correct now,"" he said.
""We were in danger of ideologising the earlier social compact and its emphasis on meritocracy, individual effort and the fear of moral hazard,"" he added.
""But the latest changes are a step in the right direction.""
In his Rally speech, Mr Lee unveiled broad changes that would expand health-care coverage, increase housing grants to middle- income families, and make education more open and broad.
Several economists said the moves are an advancement of the shift to strengthen the social safety net that began in 2007. That was when the Government introduced the Workfare Income Supplement scheme for low-income workers who stay employed. Gradually, the scheme was expanded.
At the Rally, Mr Lee said the changes were prompted by global forces, Singapore's ageing society and growing inequality leading to social stratification. This has caused anxiety and uncertainty among many Singaporeans, and with the country at a turning point, a new approach to policies was required, the PM added.
Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob saw the new path as a ""clear shift"" with tangible changes to some longstanding policies.
""Although the Government is loath to cloak its policies in ideological terms... I can't help feeling that socialists would have said that some of the thinking behind these changes are quite aligned to theirs,"" she said. Socialists favour greater redistribution of wealth.
Former Nominated MP Siew Kum Hong felt most of the changes build on past and existing policies, but ""this NDR marks a tipping point of sorts, at least in terms of public perception"".
Some Singaporeans, however, are worried about the price tag of the new MediShield Life, a universal, compulsory national health insurance scheme for life.
Mr Lee has indicated taxes will rise or cuts will be made in other spending areas over time as ""all good things have to be paid for"".
Economists said it was difficult to estimate the extra costs, especially in the face of an ageing population, rising health-care costs and increasing longevity. The Government can afford it for the first few years, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin, but ""tax rates may have to increase at some point"".
DBS economist Irvin Seah suggested the Government could take more contributions from current returns on the reserves invested when the need arises, but it would leave less for investment later.
""The fact that we are starting to plan early means we can garner the financial resources to make the plans materialise,"" he said.
Mr Low added: ""The costs at this point are not very significant... But this is not the final set of concessions. This is the start of more to come.""

","   CALLING for a rethink, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim yesterday urged his people to ponder on the kind of society they want Singapore to be in the next 50 years and their role in shaping its future.
While meritocracy and multiracialism must continue to underpin Singapore society, they need to take into account an increasingly diverse society and the dangers of elitism, he said at a Hari Raya Aidilfitri dinner gathering.
His comments come amid warnings from government leaders against elitism creeping into Singapore's system of meritocracy.
In a speech peppered with questions that reflected his concern about emerging attitudes, he said calls to strengthen the distinction between Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans worry him.
""If pushed too far, such calls can potentially impoverish the idea of citizenship by commoditising the concept,"" said Dr Yaacob, who is also the Minister for Communications and Information.
He asked: ""Do incentives and benefits define who we are...? Do we want a future Singapore where relationships are merely transactional? Or should we have a society based on mutual respect and help regardless of one's background?""
His view was that benefits of citizenship, important as they are, do not define Singaporeans and are ""not the core of who we are"".
He also wondered how society could ensure excellence and compassion, a reference to a recent call by Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong for a compassionate meritocracy, with those who do well giving back to society.
As for multiracialism, he said as more people from diverse backgrounds become citizens or work here, more questions would arise.
""Should we not also embrace them as part of building a better Singapore?"" he asked.
""Should we not also welcome those who have chosen to stand with us and call this country their home?""
Noting how the community is multiracial, with Muslims from different parts of the world, he said: ""We must continue to take the lead in embracing all who come to our shores to support in the building of our community and our nation.""
Dr Yaacob also urged community leaders to support the drive of young people to do good work as they will shape the contributions of the Malay-Muslim community to Singapore's success.
""It is my wish and hope for our community... to be among the authors writing the next chapter of our Singapore story,"" he said.

This was especially true for me, a member of the blind community in Singapore.
Despite the challenges Dr Yeo faced, she went on to make her family and community extremely proud.
The blind community can also take pride in the achievements of two other equally notable individuals: Dr Goh Hock Huan, a research scientist at the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language, and Assistant Professor Wong Meng Ee at the National Institute of Education.
They have overcome their blindness and are role models for those striving to achieve their aspirations.
Dr Wong was a proud recipient of the President's Social Service Award for his significant contributions in raising awareness of the less fortunate, and as a fund raiser for various charities.
The fruits of our labour, coupled with the opportunities offered by Singapore's meritocratic system, enable each and every one of us to realise our potential.
Perhaps it is timely for us to ask ourselves how we can, in turn, contribute positively towards our community and this country that we call home.

","   IN TWO years, Singapore will celebrate its 50th anniversary as a sovereign and independent country. The Government of Singapore has appointed me to the steering committee in charge of the celebrations. In this essay, I wish to share my reflections on what makes me a Singaporean.First, I am a Singaporean because I was born here, grew up here, went to school here, married here and live and work here.
My wife used to ask me: ""Where would you like to spend your retirement years?"" I would reply that I wish to work until I die and would like to die in the land of my birth. I have spent my whole life working for Singapore and, although I have never signed a bond of service, I feel bonded to Singapore.
It is, of course, true that you don't have to be born in Singapore to be a Singaporean. One of our founding fathers, Mr S. Rajaratnam, used to say that being a Singaporean is not a condition of one's birth but of one's conviction. In that spirit, we have welcomed many, who were born elsewhere, into our family. I count among our compatriots friends like Mr Asad Latif, born in India; Mr Alain Vandenborre, born in Belgium; Mr Ray Ferguson, born in the United Kingdom; Mr Simon Israel, born in Fiji; and Mr Gautam Banerjee, born in India.Second, what makes me a Singaporean is the fact that my close friends include Chinese, Malays, Indians, Eurasians, Arabs, Jews, Armenians. I venture that hardly any Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian or Indonesian can make the same claim; and few even among Americans, from the land of the melting pot.
In the short space of half a century, we have succeeded in achieving a level of acceptance - I would even call it celebration - of the diversity of the human family, which no older nation has done.
I believe that, if presented with a worthy Malay candidate, the electorate of Singapore would elect him or her as our President. I also believe that Singaporeans are ready for a non-Chinese Prime Minister.Third, the Singaporean's cultural DNA includes a gene that respects all faiths.
Although Singapore is a very small country, our Inter-Religious Organisation consists of the representatives of 10 of the major religions of the world. A good Singaporean may or may not have a religion. However, he is schooled to respect all faiths, and no matter how much he may believe that his faith is the one true faith, he may not denigrate the faith of others.
This is why Singaporeans reacted so strongly when a Christian pastor was caught bad-mouthing Taoism and Buddhism. It is not only against the law to do that but it is also against our social norm. Inter-religious harmony is one of our most precious achievements.Fourth, I believe that Singaporeans share certain core values. The Singaporean is honest, hard-working, law-abiding and reliable. We believe in meritocracy.
I know that, as imperfect mortals, we don't always reflect these virtues in our daily lives. But I would maintain that, on the whole, they are the values that Singaporeans live by. For this reason, Singaporeans are head-hunted by the private sector and sought after by international organisations. The fact that Transparency International ranks Singapore as the cleanest and most non-corrupt country in Asia and one of the top five in the world vindicates my view.
I was also very pleased by how well Singapore did in the Reader's Digest's exercise, in which a certain number of wallets is randomly dropped in different cities around the world. The exercise was to find out how many wallets were returned. In Singapore, seven of the 10 wallets dropped were returned by the finders. This was a high score. I am also convinced that Singapore's taxi drivers are among the most honest in the world.Fifth, Singaporeans speak English in an identifiably unique way. I don't mean Singlish. I mean our accent and intonation.
I had a very close American friend called Miriam Levering. One day, she was on a street car in Vienna. She heard several men talking to one another in English. She went up to them and asked whether they were from Singapore. They said yes and asked her how she knew. She said: ""You speak just like my friend, Tommy Koh.""
Although I have spent more than 20 years of my life in America, I have not acquired an American accent. I therefore cannot understand why some Singaporeans, who have had much less exposure to the West, speak English with a fake foreign accent. We should be true to ourselves and speak English in the Singaporean way. There is no need to put on an Oxbridge accent or an American accent.Sixth, one of the things that make me a Singaporean is my love of our hawker food. Cooking and baking are two of the greatest inventions of the human civilisation. When I was living in New York and Washington, I would often ask Singaporeans what they miss most about home. In their replies, they would always mention family, friends and food.
Our hawker food reflects the inter-racial and inter-cultural diversity of Singapore. Eating is also an arena in which Singaporeans cross many boundaries. Thus, I have Indian friends who love Chinese food and Chinese friends who love Indian or Malay food. Our hawker centres should be preserved and enhanced because they are where Singaporeans of all races, ages and incomes meet and enjoy our unique culinary achievements. I am therefore very pleased to be one of the judges, for the fourth year, of the Singapore Hawker Masters competition, sponsored by The Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao.Seventh, I love physical Singapore. I love our trees, parks, gardens, forests and beaches. Singapore should keep as much of our natural heritage as possible. We should also aspire to maintain a balance between heritage and modernity in our built environment. I regret that my primary school has disappeared and my high school has moved house twice. I am, however, happy that my law school has returned to its original home at Bukit Timah.
I am very encouraged by the new interest shown by Singaporeans, young and old, to preserve our memories, history and heritage. This is good because a nation is a people bound together by their collective memories of the past and their shared dreams of the future. We need to anchor our memories of the past to physical Singapore.

In this ideal social setting, every worker is respected no matter what profession he is in. For those who have done better than others, they should contribute back to society or their fellow Singaporeans, for they have done well through the support from our successful system.
For a nation that is almost 50 years old, we are at a crossroads. Singaporeans must take ownership to rally together to create the future they want for their home.

I WAS born in Malaysia, but became a Singapore citizen in 2008.
Immigration officials who processed my application were surprised by it, since I was stationed in Hong Kong at the time.
""Why do you want citizenship?"" they asked.
Before the posting to Hong Kong, I spent 3 1/2 years working and living in Singapore. I had tremendous respect for the government and the country.
I replied without hesitation: ""Because I choose Singapore as my home. I know I want to spend the rest of my life here.""
I moved back to Singapore in 2010.
Born and bred Singaporeans sometimes may not come to appreciate Singapore the way immigrants do - simply because immigrants have seen how bad things can get in other countries.
The only competitive advantage this country has is a good government, which has spawned good schools, the rule of law, meritocracy and corporate governance, which have in turn brought high-end investments here. These investments have raised the standard of living for all.
At the heart of good government, of course, is Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Through his brilliance and sheer tenacity, he has proven that one man can make a difference. He took the poorest country in Asean (by gross domestic product per capita) and made it the richest.
I watched the National Day Parade this year from my new office on the 46th floor of the Marina Bay Financial Centre, which has a breathtaking view of the bay. The development of the bay area is a story in itself - of how Singapore can create value from little more than air, water and earth.
When Majulah Singapura was played, I sang it with my right hand to my chest. I sang it with pride because I love my new home country.
On Mr Lee's 90th birthday, I want to say: Mr Lee, you are one in a billion. Thank you for building this great nation.

","   THE public service is casting its net wider to schools that do not traditionally produce government scholarship winners, in a bid to increase the diversity in its ranks and guard against elitism.
In an open letter on the Public Service Commission (PSC) website yesterday, its chairman Eddie Teo underscored the value of having diversity in the public service as governance and policymaking become more complex, and demographics and the education system undergo changes.
""We need a diverse public service to avoid 'groupthink' and to appreciate the needs of a diverse Singapore population,"" he said in a letter penned to mark the start of his second term as chairman of the agency overseeing civil service recruitment.
PSC scholarships are seen as a pipeline for future top senior civil servants. But the perception that they are given mainly to students from top junior colleges is a perennial problem.
Lately, the need to address it has become more urgent amid growing concerns over social mobility and elitism.
In his letter, Mr Teo sought to reassure people that this was not the case.
The PSC, he said, will guard against elitism by taking in students from different socio-economic backgrounds and sending them to a wider range of universities and courses. The proportion of scholarship holders from traditional sources has shrunk, he added, using their schools as a proxy for socio-economic class.
In the last two years, 60 per cent of them were from Raffles Institution and Hwa Chong, a drop from a peak of 82 per cent in 2007. In the last 10 years, these two schools produced 68 per cent of scholarship holders on average.
Joining their ranks in recent years are students from such junior colleges as Pioneer, St Andrew's and Nanyang.
Hoping their presence will dispel the popular perception, Mr Teo said: ""A public service comprising only the privileged and upper classes will add to the impression that meritocracy leads to a lack of social mobility in Singapore.""
But the PSC will not go for diversity for its own sake, he added. ""We continue to subscribe to meritocracy and do not practise affirmative action or positive discrimination.""
Mr Teo said the PSC has also been refining its concept of merit over the years, and now uses psychological interviews and psychometric tests to determine abilities such as leadership, character, interpersonal skills and stress tolerance. The foremost qualities for a scholarship candidate are integrity and commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans, he added.
The shift in the PSC recruitment process comes in the wake of a new approach to governance and an education system that strives to provide opportunities for all.
In his National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong laid out a new direction to build a fair and just society.
Acknowledging this, Mr Teo said public service leaders recognise the need for diversity.
""Just as the Government is changing the way it governs, public service leaders are learning how to manage a new generation of younger public servants, who want greater participation and more voice.""
But the effort to have greater diversity would ""come to naught"" if these divergent views are discouraged, or those with different and non-conventional views are not valued and appreciated, he added.
Yesterday, principals and students said the move for more diversity would encourage more students from other schools to apply.
Indeed, principals of some of those schools said the PSC has, in the past few years, been holding more information sessions.
""The message is getting through to our students that they don't need to be the top scorer in academics. If they are well-rounded in their achievements, they have a chance,"" said Mrs Tan-Kek Lee Yong, principal of Pioneer JC.

Former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew once told an Israeli general who had helped start the Singapore Armed Forces that Singapore had learnt two things from Israel: how to be strong, and how not to use our strength; meaning that it was necessary to get along with neighbours and that no country can live in perpetual conflict with its neighbours.
But Mr Lee had no illusions about the challenges facing a Chinese-majority Singapore permanently situated in a South-east Asia in which the Chinese are typically a less than fully welcomed minority.
His greatest mistake was perhaps, during the period when Singapore was part of Malaysia, to underestimate the lengths to which the Malaysian leadership would go to defend Malay dominance and privileges and led to what was politely termed ""Separation"". But it turned out well for Singapore, better in all probability than if we had remained in Malaysia. At any rate, it was not a mistake that he would ever make again.
The basic issue in Singapore's relations with our neighbours is existential: the implicit challenge a successful Chinese-majority Singapore organised on the basis of multiracial meritocracy by its very existence poses to contiguous systems organised on different and irreconcilable principles.
This is sometimes dismissed as ""historical baggage"" that will fade with time. But it is really about the dynamic between two different types of political systems which once shared a common history but have since evolved in very different directions.
It is not easy to envisage the fundamental differences ever fading away, even if time blunts their sharpest edges.
Still, even when differences were at their keenest, it did not prevent Mr Lee from working with Malaysia (and Indonesia) based on the pragmatic pursuit of common interests. It is no secret that the relationship between Mr Lee and Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the former prime minister of Malaysia, was often testy and fraught with history. Less well known is the fact that until the 2010 agreement on railway land, the most significant Singapore-Malaysia agreement since Singapore's independence was the 1990 Water Agreement concluded between Dr Mahathir and Mr Lee, then still prime minister. Among other things, it provided for the construction of Linggiu Dam.
The incongruity of Singapore in South-east Asia is the central geopolitical reality from which flowed the constants in Mr Lee's approach towards geopolitics and key decisions.
These include, among other things: the early investment in Asean as a stabilising mechanism at a time when it was still uncertain whether Asean would survive; his emphasis on balance and the imperative of involving all major powers in regional affairs rather than acquiesce in ""regional solutions to regional problems""; the necessity of anchoring the United States' presence in South-east Asia, including the offer of the use of our facilities after US forces were no longer welcome in Subic Bay and Clark Airbase in the Philippines; the decision to look forward in relations with Japan and to forgive if not forget, despite his own bitter experiences during the Japanese Occupation; never giving up on India despite his continuing scepticism about its governance; a non-ideological approach to working with the former Soviet Union whenever possible, despite his anti-communism; and the decision to be the last South-east Asian country to establish formal diplomatic relations with China, despite his early recognition of the inevitable growth of China's influence and the close personal relations he enjoyed with many Chinese leaders.
No leader, however personally brilliant an individual, can be internationally influential if he only leads a barren rock. Mr Lee was influential because Singapore is successful.
The core operating principles Mr Lee established still form the basis of our foreign policy, although of course their application is continually adjusted to changing circumstances. This should not be surprising since we cannot choose our geopolitical situation and small countries have limited options. But the question inevitably arises: Can we continue to be internationally effective and relevant in a post-Lee Kuan Yew era?
Many years ago, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs commissioned a study on how Singapore could continue to have a close relationship with China after Mr Lee's network of personal contacts with Chinese leaders was no longer available. After lengthy consideration, the conclusion was - have more Lee Kuan Yews! This was not exactly very helpful.
But I am not entirely pessimistic. Mr Lee relinquished executive authority more than 20 years ago; we have, in effect, already been in a post-Lee Kuan Yew era for quite some time. There will never be another Lee Kuan Yew. But we are still and can remain internationally relevant so long as Singapore is successful and we do not lose the habits of mind - supple, pragmatic, disciplined and unsentimental long-term thinking focused on the national interest - the core principles and the clarity of expression that Mr Lee instilled in what is today a far more institutionalised foreign policy system.
It is, however, not to be taken for granted that we can, in fact, retain this edge. Domestic politics in Singapore is becoming more complicated. Foreign policy will sooner or later be the subject of domestic debates. This is not necessarily a bad thing provided - and this is a crucial condition - foreign policy debates occur within nationally agreed parameters of what is and is not possible or desirable for a small country.
Already and all too often I see the irrelevant or the impossible being held up as worthy of emulation; I see our vulnerabilities being dismissed or downplayed; and I see only a superficial understanding of how the world really works in civil society and other groups who aspire to prescribe alternate foreign policies. Most dangerously of all, I see the first signs, as yet still faint but alas, unmistakable, of failure by some to resist the temptation to use foreign policy as a tool of partisan politics.
Whatever the dissatisfaction with the Government, however great the desire for change, Singaporeans should not lose sight of the old adage, somewhat cliched but not invalid: Domestic politics should stop at the water's edge. Even the biggest and most powerful of countries disregard this to their cost and chagrin; for small countries, disregard could prove fatal. Fortunately the situation is not yet irreversible.

","   IN THE week of Mr Lee Kuan Yew's 90th birthday, international media outlets from The Economist to the South China Morning Post dissected his achievements and leadership style, lauding the elder statesman's commitment to long-term planning but singling out his use of repressive laws.
After attending a Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy conference on Monday on his ""big ideas"", The Economist, in its Asia blog Banyan, wrote that Mr Lee's leadership was ""less about big ideas than a big personality"". The former prime minister was a pragmatist and empiricist who always went with what worked and was prepared to change his mind when the facts changed, the writer added.
Mr Lee's ""big ideas"" were that social order and the rule of law were necessary elements for the success of the country, said the blog, which is published without naming the writer.
""So Singapore's (law) imposes harsh punishments - including caning and the death penalty - for some crimes, and retains a draconian act allowing detention without trial of those deemed a threat to national security,"" the writer said. But whether Mr Lee was right in using such repressive laws, and bringing defamation suits against political opponents, remains an open question, he suggested.
However, he acknowledged that the praise Mr Lee has attracted this week is understandable.
""Singapore is, by almost any reckoning, a success story: prosperous, stable, orderly, efficient, clean, largely free of corruption and playing an influential international role out of all proportion to its tiny size and a population of just 5.3 million.""
""And even Lee Kuan Yew's fiercest critics would find it hard to argue that none of this is thanks to his leadership.""
Mr Lee's legacy, said the South China Morning Post in an editorial on Tuesday, is the success story of modern Singapore.
But the Hong Kong newspaper signalled disagreement with ""the authoritarian limits on personal liberties he saw as being for his countrymen's good"".
""He still makes no apology for them, citing integrity, a sense of duty, no abuse of power and meritocracy as basic principles of Singapore's success,"" it wrote. ""He admits Singapore is 'loosening up' under younger leaders. We trust he is wrong when he expresses fears this may come to no good.""
Mr Lee's uncomfortable relationship with those espousing civil liberties and human rights was also a topic American journalist Tom Plate touched on in a post on the Asia Media website, which is hosted by the Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, where Mr Plate teaches. ""Lee had been known to despise Western journalists whose sole homework for the interview would be to review negative human-rights reports and dreary old clips about caning and chewing gum,"" he wrote.
Mr Plate related how, when Mr Lee was asked why he bothered to sit down for interviews with him, the Singaporean responded with a look as if he was crazy, telling the American that it was his job to ""influence the people who influence people's opinions about Singapore"". ""The response was telling,"" he wrote. ""For all his enormous towering and sometimes-scary ego, he cared most about making his little country look good and important.""
In Brazil, former central bank governor Henrique Meirelles wrote in a weekly column that apart from New York City, Singapore ""is another good example of management by results"". It was long-term vision, focus on results and search for administrative excellence ""even with short-term political losses"" that led to its success, he wrote.
Singapore's future after Mr Lee was also broached, with The Economist grouping it, along with the low birth rate, as among the difficulties the country is up against. It wrote: ""Even now, more than two decades after he stepped down as prime minister, and even though his own son now holds that office, people worry about what Singapore will be like without him.""
rchang@sph.com.sg
Regional media on Mr LeeThe Economist, in its blog on Asian politics and culture, Banyan
""Mr Lee has always eschewed a personality cult - even when he was prime minister, his photograph did not adorn public buildings - and he long refused to allow any building or institution to bear his name.
He said he had visited too many countries where the names of former leaders were being erased from public places. But he relented after he turned 80. So it was perhaps also appropriate that the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy should mark its ninth birthday and Mr Lee's 90th by holding a day-long conference on his 'Big Ideas'.
His leadership, however, was less about 'big ideas' than a big personality. He is, as many speakers noted, a pragmatist and empiricist. Like (former Chinese leader) Deng Xiaoping, he is interested less in theory than in what works, and has often been prepared to change his ideas when the facts change.""The South China Morning Post, in an editorial
""Faced with the challenge of a lack of natural resources, Lee launched a programme to transform Singapore into a major exporter of finished goods and attract foreign investment.
He has his detractors, especially for the authoritarian limits on personal liberties he saw as being for his countrymen's good. He still makes no apology for them, citing integrity, a sense of duty, no abuse of power and meritocracy as basic principles of Singapore's success.
He admits Singapore is 'loosening up' under younger leaders. We trust he is wrong when he expresses fears this may come to no good.""

","   When I applied for a scholarship to go overseas for my university studies in 1971, I gamed the system. I looked at past records of which particular course had the most number of scholars and picked it to increase my chances of success.
It wasn't a difficult decision to make.
Ninety per cent of Colombo Plan scholarships were given for engineering, so the choices were really between areas of specialisation.
There were more successful candidates who selected mechanical engineering. So that was how I decided, and graduated with the degree three years later.
Getting the scholarship was the only way I could get an overseas education, and the course didn't really matter to me as long as I got my studies funded. It wasn't the ideal way to decide one's career but, back in the 1970s, that was how most of us did it.
I didn't practise engineering on my return because I wasn't really interested, and was posted to the Economic Development Board and subsequently the Administrative Service to do policy work.
Many of my contemporaries followed a similar career path.
You could say there wasn't much diversity among scholarship recipients then - we came mainly from poor and lower middle class families, and mostly did engineering.
On the other hand, you could also argue that because most Singaporeans at the time came from similar backgrounds, we represented the large majority and whatever diversity was out there.
Singapore was a much more homogeneous society then - we were all poor - and no one made a big deal of the fact that we were so alike, in family background as well as in our life and educational experiences.
Even if you wanted to have a more diverse pool, you wouldn't know where to start.
Today's Singapore is completely different and the Public Service Commission (PSC) should be commended for trying to broaden its search for scholarship candidates.
Writing on its website, PSC chairman Eddie Teo argued that having a more diverse group of public service officers was essential to avoid ""groupthink and to tackle the much more complex and diverse issues today"".
""The PSC is also acutely conscious of the need to have public servants coming from all socio-economic classes, lest we end up breeding a class of elitist public servants who lack empathy. While it does not follow that only those with a less fortunate background can empathise with the poor, a Public Service comprising only the privileged and upper classes will add to the impression that meritocracy leads to a lack of social mobility in Singapore,"" he wrote.
This is quite a departure from the traditional thinking of getting the best into the public sector regardless of family background.
As Mr Teo disclosed, the two elite schools, Raffles Institution and Hwa Chong, dominated, with their proportion of scholarship recipients peaking at 82 per cent in 2007. It has since dropped to 60 per cent in the last two years.
It is well known that in these two schools, students from better-off households are over-represented, and critics say this shows that Singapore society is no longer as socially mobile as before.
And if the bulk of public sector scholars are from these schools, it will reinforce the perception of a closed and elitist system that draws its leaders from better-off segments of the population.
How though to put into practice Mr Teo's thinking, especially his wanting to get officers from all socio-economic classes?
The PSC says it will reach out to other schools and even to the polytechnics. That's worth trying though it remains to be seen if it will produce the desired result.
The most radical and effective way, put forth by a reader of The Straits Times in a letter published on Friday, is to discriminate against those from wealthy families.
Writer Devadas Krishnadas put it forcefully and I can do no better than quote him: ""...government scholarships are generous and open up rich pathways for personal and professional growth. They are also effectively special transfers from the public balance sheet to the household balance sheet of the recipients' families. But do high- and upper-middle-income families really need such transfers?
""Government scholarships should be engines of social mobility and be awarded based on a mix of merit and need, and not just different kinds of merit. In this way, children from middle- and lower-income households can have access to the best education that their families could not otherwise afford.""
It would be interesting to hear the PSC's response to this. I suspect it will argue that government scholarships are not meant to achieve social mobility - there are other programmes for that - and that they are primarily to attract talent into the service.
But it still does not address the question of why public money is used to fund the education of someone whose family can afford it. If that person were truly interested in public service, he could enter it after completing his studies, and let the scholarship go to someone from a less well-off family. From a national budget point of view, that means two well-educated Singaporeans in the public service for the price of one.
Perhaps a hybrid system could be devised with a certain number of scholarships reserved for the poor.
If the PSC is really serious about having a public service leadership drawn from all socio-economic classes, I cannot see how it can avoid some sort of income criteria.
What about the issue of groupthink in the service which Mr Teo highlighted?
I am glad he raised it as a concern because it is a real problem in a bureaucracy like Singapore's that has been dominant for so long and which has such a close relationship with the political leadership.
The PSC's approach is to encourage its scholars to go to universities other than those in Britain and the United States, and to do a variety of courses.
But groupthink is a problem more of an organisation's culture than the background of its scholars.
It has to do with whether the leadership encourages critical thinking and questioning and is open to ideas from outside.
It requires officers with high levels of professionalism and expertise in all the different services who are able to make independent assessments and decisions, and not wait for or second-guess their bosses.
But this is really outside the scope of the PSC.
It's about the culture of the public service, of the political leadership and the relationship between the two.
But that's another story.

","   UNDER the Ministry of Manpower's new rules, companies will soon have to prove that they tried to hire Singaporeans first before they are allowed to recruit foreign professionals. Key to that exercise will be the creation of a government-run jobs bank. With foreigners costing more as well under the rules, the move should assuage the concerns of professionals, managers and executives here. Their complaints have centred lately on the perception of discriminatory treatment, based on nationality, received at the hands of some employers. There was a crying need to deal with malpractices, and the Fair Consideration Framework seeks to do so by institutionalising a mechanism that would make such attempts by short-sighted employers more difficult. This can help to make the entry of foreign workers more palatable to Singaporeans because they will be seen as supplementing rather than supplanting the local workforce.
The framework does not inaugurate a compulsory ""Hire Singaporeans First"" policy, let alone a ""Hire Singaporeans Only"" one. That would be out of character for a globalised city-state which thrives on its openness to foreign labour as much as it does on foreign investment and technology. Singaporean employees by and large understand that they benefit collectively from the status quo. But the quid pro quo, where employers are concerned, is that Singaporeans must stand a fair chance of competing with foreigners in their own country. Nationality-based discrimination goes against notions of fair play, impartiality and meritocracy. The authorities will have to implement the new framework rigorously. Employers must support the jobs initiative genuinely and not place advertisements in the jobs bank just for form's sake.
Apart from ethical considerations, Singapore employers should focus on skills and productivity in building up a core national workforce. Such a core will be stable over the long run compared to the comings and goings of foreigners and it will help prevent the social environment from deteriorating because of tensions between locals and foreigners. Singaporean employees, on their part, would be unwise to see the new jobs framework as a template for protectionism. If the pendulum swings too far towards restricting the entry of foreign workers, particularly in a tight labour market, standards might drop and investors will look elsewhere.
Indeed, the authorities should ensure that the new rules inspire confidence in the Singapore worker that he stands a fair chance at a job and in the employer that the system is not cumbersome. Regulations are necessary to protect the legitimate interests of labour - in this case Singapore workers - and a healthy economy depends on allowing the labour market to remain responsive to the laws of supply and demand.

Singapore has an ageing population, and the age factor is one of the more commonly cited frustrations among job seekers.
Employers must change their mindset that job seekers above the age of 50 are ""over the hill"", and embrace the hiring of older workers.
The civil service, being the largest employer here, must continue to set an example.
Only when the majority of employers think and behave in a non-discriminatory manner will Singapore continue to do well economically, and be respected as a country where meritocracy is truly practised.
Legislative measures should be the last resort and be avoided if possible. The labour market must continue to be free.
Job seekers, in particular those who have lost their jobs involuntarily, must also acknowledge that they are responsible for their own careers, and do everything they can to stay employable.
Having a job is not the issue, staying employable is. The Government has already done aplenty - the rest is up to the individual.

International Women's Day came and went way back in March - feminism sits uneasily with me as I am flawed - but it took a recent poll on NS to stir the hormones and make me think about what it means to be female in Singapore. The poll asked what NS means to Singaporeans.
Besides feeling thankful to the people serving in the army and remembering how crucial an entity it is, if I am horribly honest, I have to admit that it means it is an instance when I am shamefully diving for cover in my gender. Dodging compulsory NS.
I then thought about how few things in Singapore seem to sort me by my gender. And how utterly grateful I am for that because I do not really want to gain leverage through it or be outmanoeuvred through it.
I forget on most days that I am of the fair sex. Not being painfully conscious of your gender is good when you read about how horrific it is to be a woman in some countries today or back in the day when being one was like being a sexy bag of meat to be beaten, bought and sold by others. More like being a member of the unfair sex.
I do not belong to any social body - religious, familial - which makes non- negotiable patriarchal demands on how the female body is to be presented to the world: that I must either amp up the volume on my femininity to appear virtuous, or mute my femininity - also to appear virtuous. If I wear frivolously ruffled skirts and delicate, quirky accessories, it is for fun. I flit from social norm to social norm and construct a nest of an identity made up partly of sparkly, pretty things because I like it. Not forcibly feminine, just voluntarily enjoying being a woman.
And I can do that because I gratefully stand on the shoulders of battle-worn feminists through the years.
Who or what else should I thank? Meritocracy and technology - your ideas have a reach and value that are not attached to your physical presence or strength.
In the office, for only myself at least, it does not seem to matter whether I am male or female; as long as I turn in my work, I get paid.
Man or woman - it should not matter enormously as long as you have fire in your belly, light in your heart, and dreams and ideas in your head.
I tend to look past the gender of people unless they have a stereotypically masculine or feminine physical beauty which locks onto your eyes like a tractor beam. Instead, I have a rather bizarre way of seeing them based on how they behave. In my mind, they project avatars as animals, vegetables or minerals.
Here are a few examples: animal for the kind ones and sometimes intelligent ones (thankfully, there are many walking around who look like sweet golden retrievers or clever cats); vegetable for the ones with no personality; mineral for the ones who are arrogant yet as dumb as a sack of rocks.
One of my earliest experiences of being sorted and judged - and wrongly judged - by my gender was when I was a child. I felt society's eye in, of all places, the public loo.
I did not have much control over how I looked then, and had very short hair, tanned skin and looked like a young boy. So when I used the ladies, the, well, ladies clucked and tried to shoo me out. I had to protest that it was just a short haircut, while trying unsuccessfully to radiate femininity.
Later on in life, I was once asked whether I wanted to move into a particular line of work because I might want better work-life balance so I could reproduce. For a moment, I felt like a giant helpless womb sitting on an office chair. I was not asked if it was because of my professional interest in the work, but whether my uterus was feeling restless.
We are, of course, not free of the occasional hormonally charged decision, but I can imagine how dehumanising it would be if people judged us only by our gonads instead of our ideas and actions.
Perhaps I should also thank dumb luck for my growing up in a country where there is a fighting chance for equality.
I want to thank my own refusal to go along with bigoted views too, but I am afraid I have not done too much of that. I have not stood up, I am no feminist.
I am seated, I see myself and other people as strange avatars and I react to them accordingly.
I hope they look at me just as strangely too.

","   THE opening of asset manager Blackstone's office here highlights the growing opportunities in Asia in a difficult global environment, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said yesterday.
The guest of honour at the opening ceremony of the New York-based company's office here, Mr Tharman noted that in fact, opportunities in Asia are multiplying year after year even as much of the world is grappling with economic uncertainties.
""Asia is growing. It stumbles from time to time, and those stumbles are extremely useful because they refocus minds, but it's a part of the world that's growing,"" said Mr Tharman, who is also Finance Minister.
Blackstone, the world's largest alternative asset manager, is housing its 35 Singapore-based employees at Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 2.
The firm has been operating in Singapore for about 18 months and staff moved into the new office a few months ago.
The staff here work across the firm's business groups, including private equity, real estate and tactical opportunities.
The company has appointed former PricewaterhouseCoopers Singapore executive chairman Gautam Bannerjee as the chairman of Blackstone Singapore.
He is also a senior adviser to the company, as well as a member of the firm's international advisory board.
One of Blackstone's four partners in Asia handling real estate has relocated from Japan to Singapore to focus on the local and regional market.
Blackstone has also established its first treasury centre outside New York here, and will be moving some support functions here.
Unlike traditional fund managers, which would manage assets such as stocks and bonds, the New York-listed firm manages alternative assets such as private equity funds, real estate funds and credit-focused funds. It has US$248 billion (S$308 billion) in assets under management worldwide.
Blackstone co-founder and chief executive officer Stephen Schwarzman, who was also present at the opening ceremony, noted that the firm has had a longstanding relationship with Singapore founded on shared ideals such as meritocracy and intellectual integrity.
""These cultural similarities have made possible the longevity of our partnership built on mutual respect and trust, as our approach to asset management and Singapore's vision for its economy coincide in many ways: we're careful, we're prudent but we put a high premium on performance and innovation,"" he said.
""We know that Singapore chooses its investment partners by criteria just as stringent as ours, and accordingly we could not be more honoured to know that we have Singapore's stamp of approval in our work together.""
Mr Tharman noted in his speech that the principles that Blackstone applies to its business are also critical for Singapore.
""I think at the end of the day what's most important to Singapore, just like for Blackstone... is never being stale and repetitive in what we're doing, always being open to ideas, never thinking we've done it when we haven't and that's critical for Singapore.
""Each time we go through a new phase and we've done something which people regard as a bit of an achievement, we must know that we could lose it or others could catch up, which is a good thing, and we've got to move on to something else and do it even better,"" he said.

","   POLITICAL meritocracy is the idea that a political system should aim to select leaders with above average ability to make morally informed political judgments. That is, political meritocracy has two key components: (1) the political leaders have superior ability and virtue; and (2) the selection mechanism is designed to choose such leaders.
Political meritocracy is central to both Chinese and Western political theory and practice. Political thinkers - from Confucius and Plato, to James Madison and John Stuart Mill - struggled to identify the best strategies for choosing leaders capable of making intelligent, morally informed judgments on a wide range of issues.
But such debates largely stopped in the post World War II era. In China, they stopped because Maoism valued the political contributions of farmers and workers over those of intellectuals and educators. In the West, they stopped because of the intellectual hegemony of electoral democracy. A democracy demands only that the people select their leaders; it is up to voters to judge the merits of candidates. While liberal democracies empower experts in, say, administrative and judicial positions, they are always accountable, if only indirectly, to democratically elected leaders.
In Singapore, however, political meritocracy has remained a central issue, with the country's leaders continuing to advocate the institutionalisation of mechanisms aimed at selecting the candidates best qualified to lead - even if doing so meant modifying the democratic process in order to facilitate the election of these pre-selected candidates.
In order to win support, they have sometimes appealed to Confucian tradition. As Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong explained, one of the many Confucian ideals that remain relevant to Singapore is ""the concept of government by honourable men, who have a duty to do right for the people, and who have the trust and respect of the population"".
After attaining independence in 1965, Singapore's leaders gained the population's trust and respect by presiding over spectacular economic growth. Over the last few years, declining electoral support for the Government suggests that the public's trust in its political leaders has diminished, compelling the Government to adopt a more accommodating stance.
While Singapore's leaders still contend that meritocratically selected officials will take a long-term view, rather than cater to electoral cycles, they recognise the need for greater equality and wider political participation. To this end, they have eased restrictions on political speech and stopped pursuing harsh retaliation against opponents.
Moreover, to reduce income inequality and enhance social mobility, Singapore's Government has increased benefits for the socioeconomically disadvantaged and the middle class, including by investing in education and making health care more affordable. This new approach has been dubbed ""compassionate meritocracy"".
Singapore's discourse on meritocracy has failed to gain much traction abroad. This is largely because it was not presented as a universal ideal. Rather, Singapore's leaders have consistently emphasised that the need to ensure that the most capable people are in charge is particularly pressing in a tiny city-state with a small population, limited resource base, and potentially hostile neighbours.
Nonetheless, the discourse on political meritocracy has been revived beyond Singapore in recent years. One reason is the increased realisation that electoral democracy is a flawed political system, and that meritocracy can help to remedy some of its flaws. Winston Churchill famously said that democracy is a flawed political system except for all the others. But he had Nazism and Stalinism in mind as the alternatives.
The most obvious problem with electoral democracy is the ""tyranny of the majority"", which allows the voting community to oppress unpopular minority groups. But today, an equally serious problem is the ""tyranny of the minority"" in which a well-funded minority group can block necessary reform.
But perhaps the most serious problem is ""the tyranny of the voting community"". This occurs when voters support benefits for themselves at the cost of future generations, who lack representation in the political process. On issues such as global warming, the ""tyranny of the voting community"" might well spell the end of the world as we know it. At the very least, meritocratically-selected political leaders could help to check such tendencies.
The second reason for the recent revival of political meritocracy is the rise of China. Here, Singapore has played an important role. Notwithstanding claims about Singapore's unique context, the actions of Singapore's political leaders suggest a belief that Singapore's model of political meritocracy should influence other countries, especially those with a Confucian heritage.
Since the 1990s, thousands of Chinese officials have travelled to Singapore to learn from its experience. While Singapore's political system could not readily be transferred to a huge country like China, it constitutes a model that has helped to shape China's recent move towards meritocracy. Inspired by Singapore's example as well as its own history, China has developed a sophisticated and comprehensive system for selecting and promoting political leaders that involves decades of training and a battery of exams for officials at various stages of their careers.
These meritocratically selected leaders have overseen an economic boom that has lifted several hundred million people out of poverty. At the same time, however, problems like inequality, environmental degradation, official corruption, and repression of political dissent and religious expression have worsened.
In order to reverse these trends, China needs to implement democratic reforms aimed at checking abuses of power. It also needs to develop its meritocratic system further. Government officials should be selected and promoted on the basis of ability and morality, rather than political loyalty, wealth, or family background. And officials should be rewarded for their contributions, not just to GDP growth, but also to reducing social and economic inequalities and promoting a more caring form of government. Here, too, Singapore's example of compassionate meritocracy can offer useful lessons.
With the global balance of power shifting rapidly, China can no longer be judged solely by Western liberal-democratic norms. Meritocracy, which is central to the Chinese political tradition, will almost certainly serve as a reference point from which to assess the country's development. But what precisely should be the standards for assessing meritocratically-selected political leaders? That will be the subject of my next comment.

","   Singapore has many strengths, including a unique ability to bring the East and West together in a way that provides hope to those who worry that such competing civilisations may be incompatible.
CAN Shanghai learn anything from Singapore's soft power?
This was the question posed to me for my opening keynote address for the Shanghai Mayor's International Business Leadership Advisory Council (Iblac) meeting in Shanghai on Oct 27.
I was tempted to go to the podium and say: ""Nothing"". It would have been my shortest speech ever.
However, on deeper reflection, I realised that even though Shanghai's population is almost five times that of Singapore, it might learn a lesson or two from Singapore's experience. I therefore gave a speech on the seven pillars of Singapore's soft power. It was well-received by the mayor and Iblac. Hence I thought it might be worth sharing it with my fellow Singaporeans in the hope that it will generate a robust discussion and produce a more authoritative list of the key pillars of Singapore's soft power.
Leadership and governance
THE first pillar is obvious: exceptional leadership. The quality of mind of our founding fathers is equal to that of America's. One of them, Dr Goh Keng Swee, even became an adviser to the great Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. There is also no doubt that Mr Lee Kuan Yew is one of the best known global leaders of our time. I told my Shanghai audience that even though he is highly respected in the West, he never hesitated to convey hard truths to Western audiences. One of Dr Henry Kissinger's favourite stories is about how Mr Lee once told a distinguished group of Harvard professors at the height of the Vietnam War: ""You make me sick"". Mr Lee has clearly put Singapore on the global map.
The second pillar is good governance. As I tell every student of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, Singapore's success is based on three key elements: meritocracy, pragmatism and honesty (with honesty being the toughest part). Fortunately, even though rule of law is a Western concept, it works equally well for Eastern societies.
I emphasised that in Singapore the law stands above the Government. The entire Cabinet is subject to the same laws as the rest of us. Hence, when a former law minister was found to have been driving recklessly, he was charged in court for driving without care. No one in Singapore is above the law.
Multiculturalism, language
THE third pillar is multiculturalism. I emphasised that four major world civilisations interact on a daily basis in small Singapore: Chinese, Malay-Muslim, Indian and Western. It is not necessarily an easy thing for people of different cultures to get along. Hence, there are strong laws in Singapore against racial and religious insensitivity, and regulations to ensure that minorities are represented in each public housing estate. Few other societies in the world could match Singapore's record in managing multiculturalism.
The fourth pillar is the English language. Indeed, Singapore is possibly the city whose people have the strongest English-speaking skills in Asia. Each Singaporean child is taught both English and his or her mother tongue. Exposure to the English language does not just provide linguistic skills. It opens windows into the rich heritage of Western civilisation, giving Singaporeans another competitive edge.
Food and environment
THE fifth pillar is food. As Mr George Yeo has famously said, eating is the ""tao"" of Singapore. Singaporeans feel comfortable eating several different cuisines in one day, or even in one meal. I told the story of how the butler at the official Malaysian guesthouse was shocked one morning when then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong asked for Indian thosai for breakfast. Peranakan cuisine is also a local innovation, with the mother of Mr Lee Kuan Yew having produced one of the best cookbooks in this area. As I learnt later, this revelation surprised the Shanghai audience.
The sixth pillar is the green environment. Singapore is only one-fifth the size of Rhode Island, the smallest state in the United States. Yet it has more tree species than the entire 48 continental states of the United States combined. Singapore also has Tree Planting Day every year, to emphasise the importance of staying green.
Open to the world
FINALLY, the seventh pillar is that Singapore is the most open and globalised country in the world. Singapore's total trade is 31/2 times the size of its gross domestic product (GDP). This is one of the reasons the World Bank ranked Singapore as the easiest country in the world in which to do business. The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Singapore as the third most competitive city in the world after New York and London.
Given the current sceptical environment in Singapore, I would not be surprised if some Singaporeans react to this list with the comment: ""So what? Other cities got lists also, what."" That is true. Other countries also have their lists. But the combination of these seven elements gives Singapore a truly unique position in the world, as I emphasised to the audience in Shanghai.
Soft power depends a lot on the global context. In the 19th century, when Europe was dominant, London and Paris dazzled and attracted the world with their soft power. But times have changed. Power is shifting from the West to East. But the West is not finished. It will remain the world's strongest civilisation for some time to come. Hence, the cities that will do well in the area of soft power will be those that bring together the best of the East and the best of the West. This is where Singapore stands out.
Dual identity
SINGAPOREANS enjoy a unique dual identity of living in the most Asian modern city (Seoul and Tokyo remain fundamentally Korean and Japanese cities respectively), as well as being the most Westernised. All this brings me to the key aspect of Singapore's soft power that I emphasised in Shanghai.
If Singapore can continue its practice of bringing together the best of the East and the best of the West in one city, it may provide a hopeful example to a world that believes that it will be difficult for the East and West to live together. Hence, if we succeed in Singapore with our soft power, we may be achieving something that is globally significant, even in the metaphysical dimension.
And, why do I say metaphysical? Rudyard Kipling once famously said: ""Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet."" Many in the world today still believe that Kipling was right.
Hence, if Singapore can bring together the East and West, this will change our dominant global world view (Weltanschauung). Anything that changes our Weltanschauung is metaphysically significant.

","   THE Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ms Low Yen Ling, yesterday defended Singapore's record of women in politics.
Compared with a decade ago, there are more women in Parliament now and Ms Low argued that it is more important to anchor political representation on meritocracy rather than impose gender quotas.
She was responding to Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied GRC), who had cited a recent World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report which shows Singapore's relatively low ranking in terms of political empowerment.
Ms Low pointed out that of the 99 seats in the House, 25 are occupied by women. ""So in terms of percentage, we are doing better compared with a decade ago. Percentage-wise, 25.4, and this compares very favourably with the Inter-Parliamentary Union of 21.4 per cent,"" she said. The union is the international organisation of Parliaments.
Singapore's ranking was 58th out of 136 countries this year, compared with 84th out of 130 in 2009, said Ms Low.
Ms Lim, who is chairman of the opposition Workers' Party, had asked if the Government was satisfied with the scores. She said: ""While we scored fairly well, 47 out of 136 for MPs, in terms of Cabinet, we are really far down.""
Singapore is ranked 125th out of 136 countries - in terms of women in ministerial positions - she noted. ""Instead of having just one lady minister out of 18 currently in the last few decades, do we expect any improvement in this area?"" she asked.
Currently, Ms Grace Fu, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, is the only woman Cabinet politician. But the first woman Cabinet minister is Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, who was promoted in 2009. She was defeated in the 2011 General Election.

Leading the way is the Singapore Food Manufacturers Association, which hopes to introduce more local food products to the Chinese market.

Value of fostering applied skills
Employers clearly appreciate the applied skills of Institute of Technical Education graduates. But social attitudes might still lag. As more strive for paper qualifications, there is a risk of home-grown teams becoming top heavy. It takes a good mix of skills to compete effectively in a fast-changing marketplace.
Art of de-escalation
AMERICAN Vice-President Joe Biden sought to assure Asian allies that the United States is a ""resident Pacific power"" but he did not give a clear idea of how the US will respond to China's aggressive moves in the region. China, on its part, is piling up pressure in the region, but must also learn to de-escalate conflict, says Straits Times writer Jonathan Eyal.

","   PRIME Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the ruling party is determined to keep Singapore an open and compassionate meritocracy, and a fair and just society, as the People's Action Party (PAP) updated its goals for the 21st century at a party convention.
Addressing 1,400 PAP members at the Kallang Theatre yesterday, PM Lee said the party's new resolution was aimed at re-interpreting its goals as the PAP forges a new way forward amid a changing Singapore. ""We are at an inflection point. Our society is more diverse. Our economy is more mature. Our political landscape is more contested,"" he said.
The PAP was responding to this through its renewal and transformation at the mid-term of the Government formed after a watershed general election in 2011.
The changes were in line with Mr Lee's National Day Rally message, of a strategic shift in the social compact, for the state and community to play a bigger role in creating a fair and just society.
Speaking in Malay, Mandarin and English, Mr Lee announced a new PAP seniors group chaired by Parliament Speaker Halimah Yacob and with Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong as adviser, to champion the cause of the elderly. Caring for Singapore's pioneer generation is one aspect of a fair and just society, Mr Lee added.
He stressed the need to strengthen the Singaporean identity by maintaining the common space among people of different races and religions, observing that these remain powerful forces and that religious consciousness today is stronger than before.
Mr Lee, the PAP's secretary- general, said the party must be clear about its direction as it alone can provide national leadership. It last revised its founding goals to build a vibrant, multiracial, just and fair society in 1988. It is time to interpret and update them.
""We can all agree these are the right things to do... But what do these ideals mean tangibly, concretely, in this day and age? We must interpret these goals in the new phase and with a new generation,"" he said.
The resolution statement that party members adopted yesterday was put together after three months of engagement sessions with party activists.
On the updated goal to create an open and compassionate meritocracy, Mr Lee said that while the party has always stood for opportunities and meritocracy, the approach must change as there is now a higher level of development, a wider income gap and slowing social mobility.
So Singapore is changing how it grows the economy, away from pure expansion, to higher productivity and new industries. But it must also maximise equality of opportunity and moderate inequality of outcomes.
""We will continue to invest in every Singaporean. Make sure that your success doesn't depend on your background or family circumstances, by helping those who are born with less get to a good starting point,"" he said.
""We will provide diverse pathways of success, treat all with dignity and respect... Thereby, we can keep our society open, mobile and enable our people to rise.""
Supporting the changes, activist Tan Siang Hui, 37, of the Jurong Central branch said: ""The resolution gave me a sense of the specific road map and direction at this juncture.""

",NA,"   SHORTLY before the general election in May 2011, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told ministers and cadre members of the People's Action Party: ""Never forget we are servants of the people, not their masters. Always maintain a sense of humility and service. Never lord it over the people we are looking after and serving."" That was a dramatic reiteration of the fact that the party should not let its defining purpose, to serve the people, be overshadowed by its longevity in office. The gap between the speech and the election was too short for the speech to make a forceful electoral impact.
Two-and-a-half years later, and halfway through its current term, the party's new resolution continues the message of that speech. It reinterprets the PAP's abiding goals - the building of a fair and just society, and an open and compassionate meritocracy - in the light of Singapore's current circumstances. These are characterised by an ageing population, a wider income gap, slowing social mobility, and an altered political landscape in which social media has amplified the airing of discontent. Mr Lee, the party's secretary-general, has set it on a decisive course forward in a more diverse society, mature economy and contested political scene.
Demographic change looms large as the PAP surveys the horizon. Its decision to set up a new interest and advocacy wing for seniors, on a par with its women's and youth wings, reflects the reality that those above age 65 will make up one in five of the population by 2030. Understanding the needs of older party members is an important way for the PAP to keep its finger on the pulse of the pioneer generation of Singaporeans in general, for whom medical needs figure high on their list of priorities and worries.
But even as it focuses on the legitimate demands of this group, the party will have to stay connected with younger voters, whose vocal presence on the Internet has an influence on setting the electoral agenda from below. The party is committed to preserving a common space for people to articulate their views. This is essential because informed discussion and debate are at the heart of a thriving polity. Using the resources of the Net convincingly is not only a tactical but also a strategic necessity in the battle for hearts and minds in which information is the chief weapon. Another area - the sensitivity and decorum with which race and religion are handled in the public sphere - touches deeply on Singapore's future as a multiracial country. A determination to guard the common multiracial space signals the party's commitment to one of the non-negotiable foundations of a Singaporean Singapore.

","   SINGAPORE POLITICS
THINK of 2013 as a race, and an important one at that, because its finish line marks the mid-point of this Government's five- year term of office.
In this race, the Government got off to a rocky start.
Shortly after the gun went off in January, the People's Action Party lost the Punggol East by-election, its second such loss in eight months after Hougang in May last year.
Barely weeks later, the Government's Population White Paper got a decidedly negative reception over a single number that dominated headlines as it unveiled its population projections for the coming decades - 6.9 million people on this island by 2030.
The Government later explained that 6.9 million was the figure around which it would build infrastructure, and not a target it wished to hit. But by then, many Singaporeans bearing the brunt of the daily peak-hour crush on trains and buses, and anxious about a shortfall in affordable housing, were up in arms.
Over the next few months, there were loan curbs for car and home purchases, even as at the supply end, the Housing Board continued to ramp up its building of public housing.
By August, with the property market stabilising and public transport slowly getting back on track, the Government was ready to chart a new way forward.
This was the thrust and title of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's most important speech of the year - the National Day Rally (NDR).
It was ""not the usual NDR"", Mr Lee said, as Singapore was at a turning point.
He and his Cabinet colleagues had pondered the problems caused by global change and income inequality and taken in valuable input from the Our Singapore Conversation process.
They had decided on a new balance between individuals, community and the Government because those who are vulnerable can no longer make it through individual effort alone. ""We must shift the balance. The community and the Government will have to do more to support individuals,"" he said.
It was his 10th rally speech, and some said it was his best yet.
He sought to impart hope for the future and give reassurance for the present. He spoke especially to the pioneer generation of Singaporeans who built the country but now worry about health care and other retirement costs; to younger folk anxious that their incomes have not kept pace with housing prices; and to families who wonder if the opportunities for their children to move up are narrowing.
He spoke from a position of strength, as the leader of a government with the means to boost help for all these groups.
And so it was that as the year entered its final quarter, the Government hit its stride.
But the single hardest part of taking Singapore down this new road is dealing with the pushback from those who benefit from the current status quo.
They have geared themselves and their families to take full advantage of the networks, rankings and reward systems in place today.
They have worked hard and strategised to succeed in the competitive meritocracy that has been in place for decades.
For them, the shift towards an open and compassionate meritocracy may well prove unsettling, as changes to settled structures upset their cherished plans for the future.
The move is one towards a more fair and just society but its beneficiaries are mainly those at risk of being left behind in today's Singapore.
And so the Government's big challenge in the year ahead is to actually put its words into action, and persuade a broad swathe of society, especially the higher income and more privileged, to come on board.
In education, for example, the coming change in the scoring of the Primary School Leaving Examination will open up debate on secondary school admissions.
Several ministers have signalled that the goal is to have more students from diverse backgrounds in sought-after, brand-name schools. But changes to realise that goal are likely to also result in a less transparent system where admission is not based purely on objective exam scores, but where school administrators and educators exercise discretion on the final mix of students to be admitted.
The onus will be on the Government to explain, argue for and defend the criteria and method it decides on, as an important way to ensure opportunities to move up remain open to all.
Another facet of a fair and just society is taking care of the pioneer generation, without whom there would be no modern Singapore. They had fewer chances to further their education and, for much of their lives, earned lower wages than the cohorts that followed. The Government has plans for a Pioneer Generation Package of measures that should be ready by the time it announces its Budget for next year.
These measures will complement the biggest reform in decades of the national health-care insurance scheme, Medi- Shield, so as to extend its coverage to every citizen for life.
Here again, the challenge will be managing expectations of how the costs and benefits are spread out, with the state and the working population having to foot the lion's share of the bill for improved coverage.
There are many challenges ahead as the Government continues shifting the balance in social support, in favour of the weak and vulnerable.
But in demarcating this new way forward, Mr Lee and his government have seized back the initiative after a shaky start to the year, when they were put on the defensive by their own miscalculations at the ballot box and in policy planning.
Many unknowns remain, including how the economy and property market will fare next year. But for now, the Government is leading from the front and is primed to set the agenda for action in the new year.

","   A year of anxiety and compassion in 2013 may need to give way to a year when Singapore talks about shared values and principles.
FOR many Singaporeans, 2013 has been a year of emotions.
There was compassion and relief associated with the shifts in social policy on education, health care and housing.
But there was also anger, anxiety and disappointment associated with the population debate.
The strong reactions to the Population White Paper released at the start of the year influenced subsequent discussions on all issues related to housing, transport and employment.
The year closes with the shocking riot at Little India, which triggered emotions ranging from discomfort to fear.
Perhaps it is the power of the negative and its contagion - it appears that negative emotions, rather than positive ones, have dominated much of 2013. But the negative emotions have also yielded some good. It is useful to reflect on some positive outcomes that resulted from the negative emotions and contemplate how we can move forward as a country.
Negative emotions, positive outcomes
STUDIES have shown that negative emotion can impede good judgment but it can also lead to positive outcomes. The narrative that emotion is a beast to be tamed by rationality is scientifically inaccurate and politically self-defeating.
Emotions are not just natural consequences of events or instinctive reactions to them.
People experience negative emotions when the progress towards their goals is being obstructed, or when they think their important concerns have been trivialised. Conversely, people experience positive emotions when they are making progress towards their goals, or when what they consider important is given high priority.
This means emotions can be effective signals and springboards to help policymakers diagnose problems and formulate solutions. To do this, one needs to understand and address emotions by linking them to the concerns, aspirations and goals in various segments of the population.
For example, the strong negative emotions experienced and expressed in the population debate have surfaced many deeper issues concerning sustainable economic models, urban planning, manpower management, fair employment practices, social mobility and social cohesion.
As a result, it has become clearer that policies must not be formulated narrowly as singular solutions to isolated problems. This is especially when problems are inter-related and a narrow solution to a problem may create more serious problems and unintended negative consequences.
Systems thinking and strategic-futures thinking are needed to formulate and implement integrated policies - policies that address multiple goals in a complementary manner and anticipate alternative scenarios.
So, in retrospect, 2013 may be characterised as a good year of emotions for Singapore despite the dominance of negative emotions. This is because critical issues that used to be latent were made explicit in public debates and policy discussions.
Some may describe the often-contentious discourse as a wake- up call or political crisis.
But I see it as an opportunity to understand the various economic-social linkages and develop constructive responses to them.
Emotion can yield positive outcomes but it cannot be the foundation of a society's future. For society to progress, we need to address public emotions in context. This context is provided by values regarding what is important, and principles for guiding actions.
To translate affect into action, there needs to be some consensus on what is important to be actualised and how to do so. As a country, we need shared values and guiding principles to evaluate policy and public actions.
Shared values
WHAT might be some values that we are likely to achieve consensus on and perhaps deserve more public discussion in the year ahead? I suggest three values - integrity, fairness and social harmony.Integrity requires individuals and groups - be they in public, private or people sectors - to be impartial and non-corrupt. This often refers to personal character but it also involves how breaches of integrity are handled.
Wrongdoing must be reported and pursued, regardless of the position of the individuals involved or the political or public embarrassment that may result.
Public agencies must remain impartial - both actual and perceived - when carrying out their functions. Public trust in the integrity of public institutions is critical when dealing with contentious issues in an environment of increasing political contestation.People are sensitive to fairness in the distribution of outcomes and fairness in the processes leading to those outcomes. Fairness is also critical in the treatment of the individual, whether it is in the rewards given or help offered.
How we evaluate and therefore treat an individual should be based on two considerations. The first is the objective evidence of the individual's performance. The second is the individual's access to opportunities to perform.
Taken together, these multiple dimensions of fairness - outcomes, processes, performance and access to opportunities - provide a more holistic value-basis for actions to address issues of employment discrimination, development of local talent, social inequality, social mobility and compassionate meritocracy.Social harmony should underline Singapore's efforts to address challenges of social cohesion and manage social integration. Social harmony is consistent with good interpersonal and inter-group relations, and ultimately individual well-being. Social harmony is not just merely a practical means to achieve political stability and economic prosperity. It is a desirable end in itself.
When social harmony is a shared value for individuals, groups and society, there is a common basis to discuss and negotiate issues of individualism versus collectivism, inter-group competition versus cooperation, and sectorial versus national interests.
Guiding principles
VALUES are convictions of what is important and beliefs of what ought to be. But how do we translate these abstract statements of convictions and beliefs into policy and public actions? I suggest we organise and direct our translation efforts around three guiding principles - rule of law, accountability and ""people-centricity"".The rule of law translates values to actions in two ways.
First, the rule of law directly upholds the values of integrity, fairness and social harmony by maintaining law and order.
This is done by having the law define offences and prescribe deterrence for issues relating to corruption, partiality, discrimination and violence.
Second, the rule of law provides a principled and objective basis for decision making, especially in areas where personal bias and vested interests may influence the management of disagreements and resolution of conflicts. The content of laws may evolve over time. But as a principle, the rule of law must be maintained, without fear or favour.Accountability has a legal or regulatory basis but it also has moral dimensions. Unlike responsibility, accounta- bility cannot be shared with or delegated to others. Accountability is about being ultimately answerable for actions and outcomes.
As elected representatives and stewards of public funds, the Government is expected to be accountable to the people but accountability also applies to financial institutions and non-profit organisations.
Accountability is applicable to all people. For example, freedom of speech and individual discretion should be accompanied by personal accountability of what is said and done.
When individuals and organisations are accountable for their actions and results, it helps preserve the values of integrity, fairness and social harmony.The third principle is people-centricity. This involves a focus on citizen well-being, human dignity and respect for diversity across individuals. In policymaking, this means serving the interests of citizens and effectively enhancing their well-being.
People-centricity also means treating all people with the dignity and respect they deserve, regardless of their nationality or differences in background. In this regard, there is a need to improve the treatment of low-skilled foreign workers in Singapore in the areas of workplace safety, living conditions, salary payment and provision of social amenities.
As the year of emotions comes to a close, I wish 2014 will turn out to be the year of values and principles. It is probably idealistic to expect our society to achieve consensus in public values and principles in a year. But much common good can be achieved if we focus more on issues of shared values and guiding principles.

","   2013 isn't an easy year to define.
Just when you thought you had it figured out, a riot broke out in December.
Welcome to the Singapore we no longer know as well as we thought we did.
The early signs in January should have been warning enough.
When the Government announced that a by-election would be held in Punggol East, most pundits expected it would face a close fight with the opposition Workers' Party (WP).
Instead, the People's Action Party (PAP) was roundly beaten, failing to hold a seat it had won comfortably barely two years before.
While the WP's victory might not have been unexpected - by-elections traditionally favour the opposition - the size of its winning margin was.
Singaporeans witnessed the unusual spectacle of WP leader Low Thia Khiang playing down the stunning win and saying nice things about the competence of the Government.
It was too early in the year for him to play hardball.
Reality check No. 1
THE desire for a stronger opposition presence in Singapore hasn't abated and will continue to define the political landscape in the coming years no matter what the ruling party does.
Indeed, 2013 was the year the PAP tested the waters in its search for an answer to this dilemma - the more it tries to appease voters' unhappiness over immigration, housing, transport and health care, the harder it will be to counter the argument that it is doing all this because it fears an electoral backlash.
The opposition will continue to hammer away at this point, and claim credit for successfully putting pressure on the PAP; and the PAP will continue to try to find a way to get voters to support not just the changes but also the political party making them.
The year provided many clues to what its approach is likely to be.
On the ideological front, the PAP said it was moving left of centre and closer towards its original democratic socialist leanings.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called it a strategic shift in his National Day Rally in August. Four months later, at the party's convention, it adopted a new resolution that promoted greater social mobility through an open and compassionate meritocracy, and pledged to moderate the excesses of the free market.
But the PAP has also shown that, on the tactical front, it hadn't forgotten how to play hardball with its political opponents.
Its skirmishes with the WP over the running of the opposition-held town council and a certain hawker centre had all the trappings of a forward probe ahead of the main battle. So too the recent attempts to control online websites, requiring some of them to be registered.
This was new territory. The way it handled the online site Breakfast Network, resulting in it being closed, was one bit of collateral damage that could have been avoided.
Critics saw these actions as signalling the end of the Government's ""light touch"" approach.
Are these moves part of a grand plan that is being put in place, with the whole becoming clearer in the years to come?
There is no doubt the PAP wants the Internet beast controlled. That much 2013 has made clear.
What's not evident is how it intends to do so, and more important, whether anything it does will be effective or reap the political benefits it desires.
Look out for more such experimentation in 2014.
Reality check No. 2
THE desire to seek control is still as strong in the ruling party, shaped by more than 50 years of being so dominant in Singapore.
But will it succeed in cyberspace the same way it had in the real world? Should it bring its enormous power to bear, or let the beast alone?
Best guess: It can't fight its DNA, so it will continue trying.
That DNA was at work when, so soon after the by-election defeat, it introduced a White Paper setting out its approach to managing a future population of almost seven million.
The public reacted with unprecedented intensity over what many saw as an overly liberal immigration policy. Until today, it isn't clear why the Government acted in such an unprepared manner.
Was it out of touch, failing to recognise how upset Singaporeans had become over the increased influx of foreigners into the country?
Perhaps it did know but believed this was the right policy in the country's long-term interest, and it was prepared to face public anger.
Whatever the reason, it conceded that it should have done better, especially in the way it communicated its policy intentions.
Reality check No. 3
IT ISN'T so easy for the Government to change its modus operandi.
The classic way of yore was: Get a White Paper done, discuss it in Parliament, have it accepted, and proceed from there. It had worked so many times in the past.
But in the so-called ""new normal"" of domestic politics, the people hijacked the plan even before it made its way to Parliament.
Increasingly, the Government will have to recognise that although its numerical advantage in the House enables it to pass any law it wants, popular sentiment can hold sway in a decisive way.
In the meantime, Singapore's immigration policy is far from settled.
How should it manage the issue, balancing the needs of the economy with rising popular resentment against the country having too many foreigners?
2013 saw the can being kicked down the road, as the issue was just too hot to handle. Don't hold your breath for it to become more clearly resolved in the coming year.
Do so only if the air suddenly turns dangerously unhealthy, as it did in June when thick haze descended from forest fires in Sumatra.
If anyone needed reminding how tiny this little red dot was, this was the perfect example.
Singapore is so small even minor shifts in the wind direction can result in that smoky, choking air disappearing as quickly as it appeared.
That was how one weather expert described why the Pollutant Standards Index was 40 one day and the sky turned blue, and 400 on another day when it smelt like a barbecue pit.
As it turned out, the burning stopped sooner than expected or the winds hightailed, and the reminder was short-lived.
Reality check No. 4
NOTHING has changed Singapore's smallness as a country and how its fortunes depend so much on the outside world, including the land-clearing actions of Indonesian farmers and the vagaries of the shifting winds.
Expect many more external surprises to come this way, 2014 included.
And so the year closed with images of burning police cars in Little India still fresh in the mind.
As a news event, it dwarfed everything that had happened in the year..
It was the mother of all reality checks, that a night can turn so violent, overturning not just police cars, but the very idea that is safe, peaceful Singapore.
So what can one look forward to in 2014?
If there are any lessons to be learnt, it is to expect the unexpected.In fact, there's only one certainty next year - it will be a year closer to the general election than this year.
This fact alone will make it completely different from 2013.
How different?
We will have an entire year to find out.
Happy New Year.

",NA,"   THIS has been a year of leaders. Although unlikely to be recorded in the history books, the symbolically most significant day for me was Aug 6. That was the date of the launch of One Man's View Of The World, a book by Singapore's founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. The venue was the Istana.
A hush fell on the room as Mr Lee entered, went up to the podium, and made a short speech. Then, on his way out, he stopped as he passed some of his political colleagues from the early years of the People's Action Party (PAP). He lingered in front of them, unwilling to go, a dazzling smile his gift to them in old age, both theirs and his.
Mr Lee is accustomed to silence when he speaks. But this hush was different. It was born not out of fear but out of awe.
Fear would have been the default reaction when he enjoyed almost unchallenged power in Singapore. Now, what makes him iconic is his dignity in old age, his larger-than- life presence on a national scene from which he is receding physically although he created it, more than anyone else, with single- handed, steely-minded zeal. His ability to outlive his times in the minds of his people has earned him a place much higher than fear. It is respect.
In his book, Mr Lee says he is not certain Singapore will be around in 100 years. What he is certain of is that if the country gets a ""dumb"" government, ""we are done for"". ""This country will sink into nothingness.""
Not everyone is convinced. Many think the myth of Singapore's exceptionalism is an old party trick to scare people into voting for the PAP. Hence I once remarked, at a dinner, that it might be best for Singapore to enter a period of bad governance so that Singaporeans could decide what good governance is, and adjust their political beliefs and expectations accordingly. A foreign diplomat stopped eating and looked at me. ""Be careful of what you ask for,"" he said. ""Beware of people revering bad governance.""
Reassuringly, good governance was the theme of a conference on Mr Lee's legacy organised on Sept 16, his 90th birthday, by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. The mood was neither hagiographic nor elegiac. Discussions touching on the key aspects of his legacy - efficiency, integrity, meritocracy, multiracialism, and the rule of law - looked beyond the man to Singapore in the years ahead. The main concern was not how long Singapore would last, but how well it could last while it did.
Nothing could pay Mr Lee greater respect than to believe in the permanence of his defining ideas.
Chin Peng: Man of conviction
RESPECT is won not only by winners but also by losers. Perhaps the greatest loser in contemporary South-east Asian history is Chin Peng, the leader of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP).
Chin Peng, whose real name was Ong Boon Hua, was born in Setiawan in Perak. He died in exile in Bangkok on Sept 16, aged 88.
His death was not an impersonal moment for me, for I had met him. That was in October 2004 during his visit to Singapore on a speaking engagement. The occasion was a dinner hosted in his honour by the husband-and-wife team of Ian Ward and Norma Miraflor, co-authors of his memoirs, Alias Chin Peng: My Side Of History.
Dusk fell on the colonial-era bungalows in Seletar as guests awaited the arrival of the man who helped inaugurate the end of both Japanese and British imperialism. Then he walked in, slowly but surely, and took his place among the guests. He was the very picture of joviality, but deeply reflective as well.
His wit was as sharp as his political beliefs. Chin Peng was asked whether it is true that, when mischievous children in Malaya refused to go to sleep, their mothers would say ""Chin Peng is coming"", and they would shut their eyes promptly. He replied: ""Not all children.""
Who did not? ""The children of communists did not,"" he said without missing an ideological beat. Obviously, the infant communists had no reason to fear him. They were on his side of history! Whatever the fate of his ideas, Chin Peng will be remembered for the force of his convictions and the integrity with which he held on to them.
Penang Deputy Chief Minister P. Ramasamy, whose father knew Chin Peng's father, marked the passing of ""this legend"" by saying that the British would have delayed granting independence to Malaya in 1957 without MCP on their backs. He compared its role to that of the Indian National Army led by Subhas Chandra Bose, whose assault on the colonial status quo helped India win independence in 1947. Chin Peng failed to organise a communist revolution, but he remains a ""left-wing nationalist"", Professor Ramasamy wrote in the Indian journal, Economic and Political Weekly.
Chin Peng's insights were trenchant. When I asked him at the dinner how small Asian countries should react to the rise of China and India, he said: ""Beware of great-power chauvinism."" Stopping for a sip of water, he added impishly: ""But that should not be a problem. After all, you've grown accustomed to American imperialism, have you not?""
Obama: Repairing America
I HAVE not. It is difficult to portray US President Barack Obama as an imperialist. It is important for the world to have men like him in charge of countries that are critical to its economic and strategic well- being. By contrast, humans are at the mercy of fate when global leaders allow financial institutions to almost bring down the economy, start wars they cannot or will not end, and leave it to hapless successors to come to terms with reality.
President Obama's radicalism is evident in his overtures to Iran on a nuclear deal, announced in November. If the agreement holds, it will count as a foreign policy triumph equivalent in importance to his attempt to repair the US polity where it has hurt most - in lack of access to universal health-care insurance.
That is the area in which President Obama is likely to leave a deep imprint on the life of his country. His refusal to give in to political blackmail over his health-care programme, even though this precipitated a two-week partial government shutdown in October, was both conscientious and courageous. This was American leadership at its best in the year of leaders.
Mandela: Fighting apartheid
AND world leadership at its best - that was Nelson Mandela. He has been feted as the first black president of South Africa who set his country on the road to racial reconciliation and won the Nobel Peace Prize. This is true, of course, but he will loom large in the global political imagination as the embodiment of the struggle against apartheid.
Apartheid racialised everything about South Africa, from its history and economy to power and sexuality. By existing in one country, apartheid polluted the very idea of being human everywhere.
Mr Mandela dealt a blow to international racism by striking out against its most egregious form at home. That his convictions led him to the presidency is incidental to the course of history. That he had fought apartheid whether or not it led him anywhere is his true legacy.
Mr Mandela's resistance to apartheid could not have succeeded without the fraternal struggle of Africans - black, coloured and white - that fed into the grand anti-colonial calling of the African National Congress, the party of national liberation. It could not have succeeded without the sustained moral force of the international movement against apartheid.
Mr Mandela graced the earth for 95 years. His ideas will live forever.

129,"[...]he said, there is a disproportionate number of middle- and high-paying jobs taken up by younger Singaporeans.
",130,NA," Jan 4, 2014

","   The Prime Minister has charted a new way forward and this year is the time to put words into action, even as the Government grapples with a changed political landscape, marked by unrestrained discussions online. Both the ruling and opposition parties will also start gearing up in earnest for the next General Election. Robin Chan reports on six areas of change.
1 The silver lobby
THE Government pledged last year to increase help for the pioneer generation of Singaporeans to bridge a gap in skills and income between many of the old and young.
As Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said, not only has globalisation played a factor in widening inequality, but also Singapore's rapid improvement in education in less than 50 years has exacerbated that effect.
Hence, he said, there is a disproportionate number of middle- and high-paying jobs taken up by younger Singaporeans. Singaporeans who are 55 and older, on the other hand, make up half of those in the bottom 10 per cent of the working population.
The pioneer generation consists of Singaporeans in their late 60s, some of whom may have little savings and income and find it difficult to cope with the higher cost of living and health care.
Says Singapore Management University law academic and Nominated MP Eugene Tan: ""This is the generation that has provided the foundation for Singapore's success through their hard work, sacrifices and forbearance, but for some, the success of Singapore may seem to have passed them by.""
This widening gap has a political impact. Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) senior research fellow Gillian Koh says: ""The seniors of Singapore are a key political constituency - we are after all an ageing society.""
The number of residents aged 65 years or older is increasing rapidly. It will multiply three times from the current 300,000 to 900,000 in 2030, when one in every five residents will be a senior.
An IPS survey done after the 2011 GE found that a larger share of those in the 65 and above age category are swing voters, compared with 2006, increasing from 35.2 per cent to 45.4 per cent.
This year, the Government is set to announce its Pioneer Generation Package during the Budget.
It has also launched a major review of the national health insurance scheme Medishield to extend coverage for life to all. A review committee headed by Mr Bobby Chin, a former managing partner at accounting firm KPMG Singapore, will submit its proposal to the Government in May.
But this will not be without its challenges.
Already, with the impending changes, Singaporeans are worried about rising insurance premiums, especially as they age.
The ruling People's Action Party (PAP) will also increase support and advocacy for the elderly through its new seniors group, PAP.SG, set up at its last party conference last month.
Mr Inderjit Singh, an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC, says: ""With the continuously rising cost of living in Singapore, the most vulnerable group of Singaporeans are the elderly who are either retired or earn very low incomes and this group will continue to grow.
""While the younger low-income earners can go through training to improve themselves to get better-paying jobs, the elderly have less of a chance of doing such upgrading.
""So it is to be expected that the Government has to continue to focus on the elderly low-income or zero-income earners.""
2 The 'shift' in action
THE Prime Minister has mapped out a big shift and a new way forward that will see State and community giving more support to individuals, especially those who are older and more vulnerable.
This year will see changes to put that shift into action.
One change that will benefit children, especially those from less privileged backgrounds, is the setting up of five government-run kindergartens - the first time in decades that the State is providing pre-school education. A third of the places in these kindergartens are reserved for children from low-income homes. They are at Dazhong Primary, Punggol View Primary, Blangah Rise Primary, Farrer Park Primary, and a void deck in Tampines Street 45. They start with an intake of about 250 children.
The performance of these kindergartens will be keenly watched as the Ministry of Education aims to start 10 more such kindergartens by 2016.
With many policy changes announced last year, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, chair of the government parliamentary committee for education, says it is important to get the implementation right.
This starts with adjusting an imbalance in the amount of resources that government schools receive.
""We look at the intention to make 'every school a good school'. On paper it looks good, but in terms of implementation, my hope is for MOE to make sure that all our schools are given adequate resources,"" he says.
He is referring to the funds each school gets from the ministry, which are then used to invest in teachers, equipment and other teaching resources.
Last year, Education Minister Heng Swee Keat continued with a string of reforms to rebalance a tilt towards what he described as an ""extreme meritocracy"". He is now pushing ahead with a decision to replace the PSLE T-score with a broader grading system.
The change will take time as the transition will have a major impact on admissions to secondary schools. Already parents are concerned that the admissions process will become less transparent, and harder to predict.
Mr Lim, also an MP for Mountbatten SMC, says: ""PSLE elicits a huge amount of emotion. So we need to make sure that the changes are really properly executed.
""Any adjustment may unfairly penalise the students who are doing well under the current system. So I hope MOE will devote enough time to study this.""
The Government will also be considering steps to improve the mix of students from different backgrounds at top secondary schools, to guard against a concentration of students from wealthy families in top schools.
To that end, among primary schools, Mr Lim says more adjustments could also be made to the primary school admissions criteria, to give a heavier weightage to how far a student lives from the school.
Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam recently reinforced the importance of intervening early in a child's education to improve social mobility.
He said studies have shown that upward mobility is higher for the poor in areas with better schools and pre-schools.
3 Standards for cyberspace
MORE tightening is in the works, with a review of the Broadcasting Act expected to take place this year.
The Media Development Authority (MDA) has stated its intent to prevent foreign influence over local politics through Singapore's media whether in print, broadcast or online, and it will look into incorporating more comprehensive safeguards this year.
Last June, the MDA required online news sites that report regularly on issues relating to Singapore and have significant reach among readers here to register for an individual licence.
The regulator explained that this move is to place the sites within a regulatory framework that is consistent with that for traditional news platforms, which already have to obtain such a licence.
Such sites come under the licensing law umbrella if they attract at least 50,000 unique visitors from Singapore in a month.
They are required to take down content that breaches certain standards, such as those on racial or religious harmony, within 24 hours of being notified, and put up a performance bond of $50,000.
The 10 sites comprise seven Singapore Press Holdings sites such as straitstimes.com; two at MediaCorp, and Yahoo Singapore.
In explaining the change, Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim added that the plan is to bring foreign websites offering media services to the Singapore market under the regime too with this year's review of the Broadcasting Act.
At the moment, the Act does not empower the Government to take action against any entity based overseas.
New laws against harassment, whether online or in everyday life, are also expected to be tabled early this year.
Law and Foreign Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam cited a 2012 Microsoft survey that showed Singapore had the second-highest rate of online bullying among children aged eight to 17.
Mr Zaqy Mohamad, chairman of the communications and information government parliamentary committee, and an MP in Chua Chu Kang GRC, says the new laws will be to align real world norms with those in cyberspace, where the laws today are quite ""weak and onerous"".
SMU law academic and Nominated MP Eugene Tan says 2014 might be the last window for the Government to refine the regulatory framework as it will not do the Government any good to impose new measures too close to the next GE, which is slated for 2016.
But even with more rules and new laws, Mr Zaqy hopes regulators will ""continue keeping a light touch"" while aligning the rules for mainstream and new media.
""(For the Broadcasting Act review), we will see some adjustments to new media going forward. Most of the changes so far have been the alignment and updating of old policies. That may continue, if we look at where the regulators are at. It is an evolving situation, and we have to adapt as the space evolves,"" he says.
4 Managing foreign workers
THE riot in Little India on Dec 8 put the focus back on the Government's population policy.
A Committee of Inquiry into the incident will give its report on what it believes to be the causes, with recommendations on actions to take to prevent recurrences.
But former Nominated MP and socio-political commentator Calvin Cheng believes that concerns over the number of foreign workers in Singapore will linger.
In the aftermath of the riot, he wrote: ""The Committee of Inquiry will not be as important as the Government presenting to the population how it intends to manage the growing foreign migrant worker numbers needed to build the infrastructure for a larger population.""
The issue of how many foreigners there should be in Singapore is longstanding. But a reliance on them for easy economic growth, coupled with an infrastructure crunch, raised concern over their numbers, and has led to a tightening of the numbers allowed in.
There were three protests in Hong Lim Park last year against the Government's controversial White Paper on Population, which projected that there might be up to 6.9 million people here by 2030.
While the Government is unlikely to revisit the population paper this year, foreign workers and their impact on Singapore's economy and society will continue to be a key discussion point, say observers.
The focus will turn from low- wage workers to the foreign professionals on Employment Passes (EP) as the Fair Consideration Framework kicks off in August.
All eyes will be on how companies adapt to this practice, and what impact it will have on the economy.
Firms making new EP applications must advertise the job vacancy on a new jobs bank for Singaporeans for at least 14 days.
The process of implementation will start this quarter, with firms that will be subject to additional scrutiny being notified. By the middle of the year, the new jobs bank will be launched.
At the lower-wage end of the foreign worker spectrum, companies that have been heavily reliant on such labour, such as those in the retail, construction and marine industries, will have to continue adapting to a tighter labour market after successive rounds of tightening.
In July this year, the levies for foreign workers on S Passes and work permits will be increased further, rising to as much as $950 for a foreign worker in the construction industry.
But beyond that, Barclays economist Leong Wai Ho says foreign worker tightening may take a breather this year as companies adjust to the tightening that has taken place.
He says: ""We must be careful not to impose too much burden on businesses, and not to ignore global factors.""
Global economic growth is expected to re-accelerate in the first half of the year, he says, and it will drive up demand for manpower in Singapore.
Officially, Singapore is expected to grow by between 2 per cent and 4 per cent this year, after growing 3.7 per cent last year.
This growth will lead to a tightening of the labour market and wages being pushed up, says Mr Leong. So firms will find it harder and costlier to hire foreign workers, even if the existing controls are not changed.
""We have done enough and now need to strike a careful balance. There is a strong case for the foreign worker tightening on the supply side to pause in 2014, allowing businesses breathing room (and government assistance) to consolidate and plan for their future.""
The Government's long-term plan to restructure the economy and raise productivity will also come under scrutiny. Its target is to raise productivity by between 2 per cent and 3 per cent each year but progress so far has been disappointing, with productivity averaging -0.6 per cent in the first three quarters of last year.
5 Jostling for the next GE
WITH the next general election another year closer, 2014 is likely to see the sparring between the PAP and the opposition Workers' Party (WP) heat up.
But how will the WP calibrate its responses to increased attacks from the ruling party? Will the WP keep quiet, engage or go on the offensive?
Since the PAP lost Aljunied GRC in the 2011 General Election, it has been fighting to regain the momentum and votes won by the Workers' Party.
PAP MP Zaqy Mohamad says there is likely to be more ""friction"" between the ruling party and the opposition as the battle lines are drawn: ""In the first half of the term, we were in recovery mode. There was some angst in the GE and the Government has responded with various measures to assure that the voices have been heard.
""In the second half, when it comes to politics, we will see the reheating of some still not resolved issues, and friction as all parties ramp up for the next GE.""
Already, the party has been raising more questions about the WP. It has criticised the WP for the lack of a clear stand on national issues, such as an alternative population plan, and whether nurses and other public officers should be allowed to wear the hijab at work.
The WP is also being watched on how it copes with town council management on a much larger scale, following the additions of Aljunied GRC and Punggol East SMC to Hougang SMC.
Last year, the PAP took another step in its transformation. It adopted a new resolution, setting broad directions for itself, after engaging its activists over three months.
The resolution updates the party's democratic socialist ideals, and spells these out in new language: to build a Singaporean Singapore; an open and compassionate meritocracy; a fair and just society; and a democracy of deeds.
The new resolution may well inform its 2016 election manifesto, say political observers.
The PAP will also celebrate a key milestone in its history - its 60th year of existence since its founding in a Singapore still under colonial rule.
It is expected to introduce more new faces on the ground as it starts to build up its slate of candidates for the next election.
Observers will be watching to see the type and mix of potential candidates, as the PAP looks to show that it is not a party that has lost touch with the ground.
Says IPS senior research fellow Gillian Koh: ""Apart from getting the policies right, there is the bigger task of getting the people right."" What Singapore becomes will have an impact on what the PAP will have to be as a political movement, she adds.
""Can it be that broad of a broad church? Or will it have to cede ground to other political movements and groups if the Singapore that results from its policies is one with such diverse interests?""
6 Singapore@50
LOOKING ahead to 2015, when Singapore marks its 50th year of independence, the SG50 Committee plans to launch this month a call for celebration ideas, says Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong.
Mr Wong sits on the 29-member committee, which is chaired by Education Minister Heng Swee Keat. It wants to let ordinary Singaporeans have a role in planning and organising the celebrations.
Mr Wong's ministry will also be busy with the opening of the Sports Hub, which will be phased in from April. The Hub will play host to sporting events and concerts it hopes will attract many Singaporeans. He says: ""On the sports front, we already have a good line-up of events in 2014, including the Asian Netball Championships in September, the WTA Championships in October and the Suzuki Cup in December. We also have many event promoters expressing interest in concerts and entertainment shows.
""Many of us still remember the Kallang Roar in the days of the Malaysia Cup, or the mega-events at the stadium, like the concert by Michael Jackson in the early '90s.
""So with our new stadium, I look forward to an even more exciting calendar of concerts and events that will bring Singaporeans together, and create special experiences and shared memories for all of us to enjoy.""
Of the 50th anniversary celebrations, Chua Chu Kang GRC MP Zaqy Mohamad says it is a good opportunity to ""re-energise Singaporeans and the Singapore spirit"".
""This is the time to do it, as many Singaporeans are asking: 'Are we a nation that has built a lot, achieved wonders, but has no soul?'""
Whether a good feeling prevails this year will also depend on how effectively the Government communicates its plans and policies, say MPs and observers.
The Our Singapore Conversation was largely seen as a successful exercise that fed into the policy-planning process, and the Government has pledged to continue engagement in that manner.
Marine Parade GRC MP Tin Pei Ling says: ""I hope that all levels of government will do more to engage Singaporeans. Government must work harder at explaining key policy decisions in a manner that all Singaporeans can understand and connect with.
""This is the only way we can garner support for important policies or difficult decisions and keep our society cohesive and strong.""

",NA,"   I agree that there are vulnerabilities found in several core aspects of Singapore following a series of events last year that took many citizens and policymakers by surprise (""A year of rude awakenings""; last Sunday).
However, I disagree with Opinion editor Chua Mui Hoong's assertion that Singapore is no longer the fortress that it used to be.
Perhaps we need to look at all these events in perspective.
We are living in a far more complex and intricate world that is marked by fast-paced globalisation and urbanisation, rapid technological advancement, emergence of new ideologies, and changing societal values.
In addition, as argued by Ms Chua, we have become the victim of our own success and achievements.
Such complacency in the face of a much more complex environment led to a series of unfortunate policy missteps on housing, transport and immigration issues in recent years.
Still, we should take heart that the fundamental tenets of the Singapore system are still present - leadership, integrity and meritocracy.
In essence, the foundation of Fortress Singapore still remains strong and robust.

131,"[...]there is sometimes a lack of compassion towards their predicament.

"," Think

"," Guidelines
","   I attended some of the most popular schools in Singapore, studied overseas and landed my dream job when I returned.
To some, these may be measures of success. But the truth is, luck also played a part. There were external factors involved, such as being born healthy into a family with the means to provide for me.
Thanks to this, I had a good educational environment (of course, I worked hard at school too), made friends along the way who broadened my mind, and was able to choose a job that interested me without worrying if I could put food on the table.
Around me are friends who have moved along the same trajectory. We have benefited from a meritocratic system, but did not get to where we are based purely on our own efforts.
As the debate on meritocracy continues in Singapore, the idea of a ""compassionate meritocracy"" has gained traction. But just how can Singapore make its meritocracy more compassionate?
In his New Year message, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong outlined what the Government would do to ensure Singapore stays inclusive. It will keep society open and mobile through education, so that anyone can rise regardless of his family background. It will also help those who are struggling by strengthening social safety nets.
Mr Lee touched on similar themes in his speech at last month's People's Action Party convention.
Still, the Government's policies and programmes can only do so much.
To inject heart into the meritocratic system that has propelled Singapore from Third World to First, those at the top must also play a part, by recognising they have succeeded not simply because they are better than the rest.
The recurrent theme of meritocracy in Singapore's success story has inadvertently promoted an elitist way of thinking - that those who have succeeded are deserving because they made it by dint of their own hard work and intellect.
The corollary is that those who did not succeed were just as deserving of their lot, as they were lazy or less smart.
As a result, there is sometimes a lack of compassion towards their predicament.
This manifests at the workplace, for example, in the form of pay discrimination based on qualifications.
It is not uncommon that graduates and non-graduates performing the same roles get paid different amounts, just because one has a degree and the other a diploma.
While it may be logical to use past performance as a selection criterion for, say, deciding who to hire, using it to determine current merit leads to inequitable reward structures in the workforce, and penalises choices made in the past.
A better way might be to reward people for their current contribution. A meritocracy, after all, would be more compassionate if it forgives people who may have made mis-steps, and provides more entry points to success.
If we choose to pigeonhole and stereotype people in the name of meritocracy, based on their past achievements or lack of it, it will eventually breed more resentment and polarisation.
Already, there is some angst among certain segments of the population about the elitism of people at the top, who may feel they are the sole architects of their own success and see no need to help those at the bottom.
The truth, as my experience shows, (though I am far from the top) is that while hard work plays a part, it is not only the deserving who make good.
Recognising that fortune plays some part would hopefully instil a sense of humility, which would encourage the haves to give back by helping the have-nots.

","   THOSE who do well in life should remember the people who helped them along the way and share the fruits of their success with others, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday.
Speaking to more than 1,000 students at an Edusave award and bursary ceremony in his Teck Ghee ward yesterday, PM Lee reminded them that when they succeed, they do so not just with their own hard work, but with the help of their parents, teachers, friends, classmates and colleagues.
""And so you owe a responsibility to them to help them too, to care for them and to work together to give back to society so that we can all progress together. That's the way we want Singapore to be,"" he said.
""We cannot be living in a society where the winner takes all,"" he added as he called on all who do well to help others, especially the less fortunate.
Mr Lee's message to the students continues his call to keep the country an open and compassionate meritocracy amid concerns over income inequality and slowing social mobility.
It is also reflected in the Edusave awards, which recognise not just academic ability but also character and leadership. The Education Ministry introduced the Edusave Character Award in 2012.
""The Singapore Spirit contains a caring heart and does not just look out for one's own comfort, but benefits society at large and helps the poor and disadvantaged,"" he told the award winners in his Mandarin speech.
His hope is that students will be motivated beyond grades and awards to be ""good people, responsible citizens and caring Singaporeans"". To do so requires more than good academic grades; they need to have the character, resilience, determination and the desire to care for people and work with others, he said.
On resilience and being able to recover from setbacks, he added: ""That's the way we have to be, because if we're not like that, I think Singapore has no future.""
Yesterday, he singled out 11-year-old Ong Yong Jie from Townsville Primary for his resilience and perseverance. The Primary 6 pupil, who received the Edusave Scholarship, character award and a Teck Ghee PCF book prize, has a junior black belt in taekwondo and won a bronze medal in the national maths Olympiad last year.
His family has a monthly income of about $1,500. His father, a driver, is the sole breadwinner. His mother quit her job five years ago to look after him and his older sister.
Mr Lee said Yong Jie's story highlights why the Government is committed to making every school a good school. Education is the path for children to have ""every chance to succeed"" regardless of family background, income or which school they attend, he said.
Yong Jie told reporters he did not see his background as a setback, as ""the most important thing is your family members"". His ambition: to be a doctor ""or to do something that can help the community and the country"".

","   SINGAPOREANS should treat foreigners the same way that they want to be treated when travelling overseas, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen last night.
He was speaking to a 300-strong crowd of students, staff and alumni at the National University of Singapore's monthly U@live forum, which features prominent members of the university community.
Singaporeans are ""extremely generous"" in their daily interactions with foreigners, said Dr Ng, who drew his observations from his work as a Member of Parliament of Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.
But at the national level, there tends to be ""some noise"" against the presence of foreign workers here, he added.
He was replying to a question from an audience member, who had asked what were some of the values among Singaporeans that should be changed.
Dr Ng also expressed concern over the state of family ties here.
""The integrity of family as a basic unit is under stress today,"" he noted, citing observations from his house visits.
While voluntary welfare organisations play a key role in taking care of the disadvantaged, he stressed: ""Family must be the first line of defence, not the state.""
The importance of family was one of the five convictions that Dr Ng shared earlier in the forum.
The others were: secularism, meritocracy, a consensus of the country's vulnerability and the need for strong national defence and security.
These issues surfaced during an interview with the forum's moderator, former Nominated MP Viswa Sadasivan.
Noting how Singapore's ""vulnerability"" had been repeatedly emphasised by Dr Ng and other forum participants, Mr Sadasivan asked: ""Why does Singapore need a $12 billion defence budget?""
Dr Ng responded that the region was ""changing drastically"", citing the ongoing territorial disputes between China and Japan.
""If we don't have a strong, deterrent force, Singaporeans would be less confident about the future. We are still a point target,"" he said.

","   I REALLY enjoyed watching The Wolf Of Wall Street. It was a film so exhilarating that I felt as if I was experiencing the same high Jordan Belfort was on throughout most of the movie.
As I walked out of the cinema, it seemed like others had too - a couple were beating their chests humming what is known as The Money Chant. It is a song made famous in a scene in the movie where actor Matthew McConaughey tells a young, naive Leonardo DiCaprio that nobody really knows where stock prices will go, and so, does the truth really matter?
Shortly after, DiCaprio, playing the eponymous Wolf, becomes fuelled by greed for women, drugs and wealth. He uses boiler room tactics to sell worthless stocks to unknowing investors, then launders money, before eventually being caught by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The movie has been criticised for glamorising greed and the relentless and unconscionable pursuit of wealth, and for not capturing at all the damage Belfort's unethical ways caused to the lives of the many small-time investors he duped.
Closer to home, there was another reminder of the dark side of wealth, as private banker Anton Casey showed - with some of his Facebook posts - the deluded sense of superiority the accumulation of wealth can create.
The Briton has rightly been criticised for his disparaging remarks about ""poor"" Singaporeans who take public transport. And there should be little sympathy for him.
What these two men have shown, whether on screen or in real life, is how wealth in and of itself is a hollow achievement without the right values and attitudes. The pursuit and accumulation of wealth can corrupt the very values needed to build a strong and cohesive society.
Foreign Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam put it this way when asked to comment on Mr Casey: ""Those who have done well in life should always be looking out for others - especially the less well-off or needy. It is basic human decency. Instead, Mr Casey showed contempt. Having money and a Porsche does not automatically mean that one is superior. Character is important.""
I could not agree more. Cultivating the right values is just as important as the economic measures taken to reduce income inequality.
Not all rich people are, of course, like Mr Casey or Belfort. Many, I believe, are in fact hard-working, respectful people.
But I still feel this fight against income inequality requires a fundamental change in our attitudes towards wealth and the poor, and a rethink of the rewards system of a capitalist-driven economy.
After all, there is a growing movement to temper capitalism at its extremes, and a realisation that the wolves are not the economic generators they would claim to be, but merely the lucky and opportunistic few who benefit from all who contribute.
The cut on banker bonuses, regulations on finance and a change in attitude at business schools are signs of this growing awakening to a need to rethink capitalism.
As countries battle income inequality, Singapore must take a stand too.
Capitalism has thrived and income inequality has been allowed to widen in Singapore, in part because of a fear that these rich men will decamp to greener pastures, taking their wealth and economy-growing talent with them.
Indeed, at a DBS Bank client conference last year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in no uncertain terms that he wished he could attract more billionaires to Singapore.
Economists have also pointed to the competition among countries in the past decade to lower tax rates in order to attract business and individuals to invest.
Hong Kong is Singapore's closest competitor in finance and business, and Singapore's corporate income tax rate has always followed its rival's closely. It has slashed its tax rate to 17 per cent, 0.5 percentage points higher than Hong Kong's. Personal income tax in Singapore has a top rate of 20 per cent to Hong Kong's 15 per cent.
I suggest the Government relook its policy of fast-tracking foreign investors to permanent resident status.
The Financial Investor Scheme run by the Monetary Authority of Singapore was scrapped in 2012, and the criteria for the Economic Development Board and Contact Singapore's Global Investor Programme (GIP) were also raised. But it still focuses purely on the amount of money a person invests in Singapore. Can more be done to tweak it to be more discerning of the type of rich we attract?
Investors in the GIP could also be asked to do social or charity work and contribute a portion of the GIP investment not only to growing the economy, but also to strengthening society.
The Government, through its ""strategic shifts"", is providing more help to the low- and middle-income classes. Last year's Budget was marked by its increase in progressivism of taxes - higher taxes on property for the rich, more workfare and cost of living subsidies for the poor.
But as an economy it means we also need to rethink the kinds of industries we want to develop in Singapore.
Can we really be a fair and just society, a compassionate meritocracy, while at the same time we try to attract the very wolves that seem to be its antithesis? Should we be a wealth management hub and financial centre, or should we be building industries that can have a real social impact - health care, education, and social entrepreneurship?
If this shift to a compassionate meritocracy is to be real and believed, we need to have more confidence that even if we set the bar a little higher, we have enough going for us to stay attractive to good talent. Countries acting together can also help to mitigate the threats of capital flight.
Pope Francis delivered a note to leaders gathering at the annual Davos World Economic Forum this past week, urging them to ""ensure humanity is served by wealth, not ruled by it"".
To keep our eyes trained on this defining challenge, we must remember to ask ourselves: Who do we want to listen to? The wolves or the Pope?

","   Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim wants self-help group Mendaki and the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore to come up with programmes to honour pioneers and tap their experience to bring about a transfer of values between them and the younger generation.
Speaking to reporters after recording a television forum on the Budget last Friday, he said the Malay/Muslim community could take pride in the many pioneers in the community who had contributed to nation-building.
He will announce details of the programmes at a later date. But they will be separate from the Pioneer Generation Package, the $8 billion bundle of health-care subsidies and top-ups to honour some 450,000 of Singapore's pioneers.
Many in the Malay/Muslim community made the choice to remain here when Singapore left the Federation of Malaysia in 1965. These pioneers worked with the other communities to build Singapore, committing to the new nation and the principles of meritocracy and multiracialism, said Dr Yaacob.
""I think it's important that the Malay/Muslim community itself celebrates our pioneers. The values which they live by, the kind of commitment they had towards Singapore... we believe it's still important,"" he said.
Dr Yaacob also addressed concerns about rising costs.Budget 2014 included rebates for service and conservancy charges, and goods and services tax vouchers for seniors and for families living in Housing Board flats, to help them with living costs.
Dr Yaacob said that while costs will go up in certain areas, because many things in Singapore are imported, the Government will try to prepare families for it through subsidies in the Budget.
He also urged businesses to tap schemes that will help them become more productive, such as the ICT for Productivity and Growth programme that will cost the Government $500 million over the next three years. ICT stands for information and communications technology.
""I would appeal to businesses to consider this seriously, because we want to transit to a higher level in terms of our productivity and we believe ICT is one of the key enablers,"" he said.

However, some people seem to have lost their belief and purpose. There are several among us who are disillusioned with or not interested in the current state of the country. Some doubt if our founding values, such as meritocracy and accountability, still exist in our system. This is worrying.
People need to know why our nation needs all of us to do our best, for Singapore to continue to stay relevant in this fast-changing world. We need to do much more to re-energise Singapore and Singaporeans.
Although we now have to manage a Singapore with more diversity in ideology, it cannot be more challenging than the racial diversity our forefathers had to deal with. Each Singaporean needs to find a common purpose and belief. We must also be mindful that progress is just a means to an end, which is to benefit the people.
Progress in the name of the common good will not matter much if most individuals cannot taste and own the success. When the man in the street is motivated and empowered, the battle is half won.

","   LAST Saturday's commentary (""Circle of trust in welfare system: Is S'pore ready?"") focused on whether Singaporeans are ready for a Scandinavian-style welfare state, but nothing was said about whether it is desirable in the first place.
It is ironic that some Singaporeans think a Scandinavian-style welfare state is desirable at a time when the Scandinavians have cut back on welfare spending following a financial crisis in the 1990s.
Indeed, the present financial crisis has led to welfare spending cuts in other European states.
The Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander, in a speech last year, said the traditional Dutch welfare state is coming to an end and needs to be replaced by a ""participation society"", in which people must take responsibility for their own future and create their own social and financial safety nets, with less government help (""End of Europe's welfare state?""; Sept 19, 2013). This sounds like the system of meritocracy that Singapore has always practised.
If the Europeans are having a rethink about the welfare state, why are we heading towards it? A European or Scandinavian welfare model involves more than just free health care; unemployment benefits and pensions are also given out.
Having a European-style welfare state here would be a serious mistake.
First, a welfare state is inherently unfair. It means that the healthy will have to subsidise the sick, and those who are more hard-working and able will have to subsidise those who are less so.
Second, a welfare state means high taxes. In Scandinavian countries, the sales tax is typically around 20 per cent to 25 per cent, though food is exempted.
High taxation comes at a price - it is a job killer. Companies would prefer to relocate elsewhere and there would be less incentive for one to take the risk of starting a business.
That is why the unemployment rate in Europe is much higher than that in Singapore.
There would eventually be a permanent class of unemployed people who survive on welfare cheques funded by taxpayers, and economic growth would slow down.
Third, a welfare state would likely lead to increased ethnic tensions in Singapore, as a group with lower educational qualifications, for instance, would tend to have a higher unemployment rate and have to be supported by others, breeding resentment.

","   BIG Idea No. 2 is a no-brainer: Make Singapore's public transportation No. 1 in the world. Why is it a no-brainer? Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur as well as Bangkok and Manila face the danger of more or less permanent gridlock with massive traffic jams. I pray and hope it will not happen, but I am also prepared to take bets it will. But even if our neighbours strangle their cities in this way, their countries will continue.
Singapore does not have this option. If our city strangles itself to death with massive traffic jams, both the city and country will collapse. Good public transportation is therefore not an option. In Singapore it is a critical necessity.
Unrealised potential
FORTUNATELY, we have all the ingredients in place to create the world's best public transportation system: money, meritocracy and motivation (the three Ms). We are one of the richest countries in the world in terms of financial reserves. We can pay for the best system. We also have one of the best civil services, if not the best, in the world. I know this well as several leading global scholars have asked me why Singapore does so well in public administration.
Few other governments in the world can match the quality of minds we have in our Administrative Service. And we also have the motivation. For us, good public transportation is a matter of life and death.
With all these assets in place, it was truly shocking to read in The Straits Times on Feb 13 that Singapore's MRT system is average in the world in terms of system breakdowns.
According to Christopher Tan, senior transport correspondent for The Straits Times, ""breakdowns on the 125-year-old, 340km, 24-hour New York City subway average one every 260,000km operated. Singapore's 25-year-old, 180km network breaks down once every 120,000km"".
When I told a Harvard professor this fact, he was astounded. He asked me: ""Should I be proud of New York or worried for Singapore?""
What happened? How did we go from being almost No. 1 in the world in MRT systems to falling behind ancient systems like that of New York?
What mistakes did we make? How did it go so badly wrong? And what can we do now to reverse this negative slide and move towards making Singapore truly No. 1 in the world in public transportation?
A 2012 PricewaterhouseCoopers survey found that Singapore's public transport systems ranked behind those of Toronto, London, Stockholm, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo and Hong Kong.
Please let me stress one point here. I am not an expert on public transportation. I do not have enough data or information to explain what went wrong. All this requires a massive study.
However as an amateur analyst of Singapore's public policies, I believe that I can point out three challenges Singapore will have to overcome to succeed in its goal of becoming No. 1. All three challenges begin with the letter C.
Critical mistakes
THE first challenge is conceptual. Public transportation is a public good, not a private good. However, when Singapore was at the height of its infatuation with the Reagan-Thatcher intellectual revolution, we believed that the private sector was better at delivering some public goods than the public sector. This may explain several critical mistakes.
My friends in the civil service have told me one of the biggest mistakes we made was to privatise the Public Works Department (PWD) and sell it off. In so doing, we lost both the engineering expertise and a storehouse of wisdom about the maintenance of public works. I hope that some day somebody will try to recreate the old PWD we used to have.
We may have also made a mistake in privatising the MRT system, handing over the operation to private companies rather than government departments.
In theory, private companies are more efficient than government departments in delivering services. Since they are concerned about the bottom line, they cut costs well.
However, private companies do not factor in ""externalities"".
Hence when the private companies cut down on the maintenance of our MRT tracks to cut costs, they did not factor in the ""cost"" to the Government's credibility when the system began to break down frequently. It will literally, not metaphorically, cost the Government billions of dollars to recover this lost credibility.
This explains why the Government has provided SMRT with $500 million to improve the maintenance of the MRT tracks. This, in turn, creates public confusion as taxpayers ask why their money should help the bottom line of private companies. There is a simple solution. We should consider making the Ministry of Finance the sole shareholder of all our public transport companies, just as it is the sole shareholder of many government-linked companies.
Fresh approach needed
THE second challenge is the culture of conservatism. Having invested billions of dollars in an extensive train and bus system, we have worked under the assumption that we can only ""tinker"" with an established system and not start from scratch.
This is a very dangerous and conservative assumption. If we work under this assumption, we will be reluctant to look for structural defects in our current system and be equally reluctant to explore bold and radical moves. If we are going to succeed in our goal of becoming No. 1 in the world in public transportation, we have to consider radical as well as conservative approaches.
Here is one radical suggestion: Organise a global competition to encourage universities, think- tanks and global companies all over the world to put forward a new blueprint for Singapore's public transportation system.
There is a lot of expertise out there. A $10 million prize would be sufficient to attract a whole slew of new blueprints. And $10 million would be a small sum to spend considering the billions we have to put in to deal with systemic flaws. The winners of this global competition could be announced when we celebrate our 50th anniversary next year.
Social experiments
THE third C challenge we face is ""comprehensiveness"". Public transportation can work well only if its planning is well integrated into existing urban planning policies. Each limb of our national planning must support other limbs. Let me cite a few examples.
First, we have to deal with the ""car"" problem. As I explained in my previous column, despite the many disincentives put in place to discourage car ownership and use, we have actually created an ecosystem which makes it more rational to drive a car than to take public transport. We now have to create a new ecosystem that discourages car ownership and use.
For a start, we should encourage new road experiments to change behaviour. In the year 2015, as part of our 50th anniversary celebration, we should exempt all taxis from paying Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) charges for one year. The goal of this social experiment is to see whether Singaporeans will make the rational decision to leave their cars at home and take taxis into the Central Business District to save on ERP charges.
At the same time, we will also discover whether this leads to a surge in the supply of taxis in the CBD. This increase in supply of taxis in the CBD could, over time, increase demand and use of taxis in the CBD.
I don't know whether this will happen. Nobody knows whether it will happen. This is why we have to try out bold experiments. The financial cost of giving taxis exemption from ERP charges will be peanuts compared to the benefits we will get if people leave their cars at home.
A downtown HDB estate?
SECONDLY, we should consider the merits of building a massive HDB estate downtown. A lot of land will be freed up when the Marina Bay Golf Course lease ends. Why not build a big HDB estate there? The obvious response will be that the land is too expensive. But the land will not be as expensive as the land in Manhattan.
In October 2011, I visited Manhattan in my capacity as chairman of the nominating committee of the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize (New York subsequently won the prize in 2012). On this visit, the surprising thing I learnt was that Manhattan had a policy to ensure that it did not create an environment where only millionaires and billionaires could afford to live.
Hence, even though the mayor of New York City then was a billionaire, Mr Michael Bloomberg, his administration worked hard to set aside land in this expensive midtown and downtown area for workers to live.
Mayor Bloomberg's New Housing Market Place Plan was designed to build and preserve 165,000 income-restricted units by June this year for 500,000 New Yorkers. It was the largest municipal affordable housing plan in American history.
To some extent, this is what we did when we built the Pinnacle in Tanjong Pagar. We should now replicate the Pinnacle experiment in our new CBD.
It is true that Singapore citizens who live in this CBD public housing will get a subsidy. However, if they use less public transportation to commute into the CBD, they will not be using the subsidies that are being given to every user of public transport. We will also enhance the social harmony of Singapore by giving less well-off Singaporeans a stake in the CBD.
The third social experiment we can try is to build shoe-box garages next to every MRT station.
The idea would be to allow us to walk out of an MRT station and rent a two-seater air-conditioned electric vehicle to take us across the last mile of our journey (and back).
Clearly, our hot and humid weather makes it difficult to walk the last mile to our destination. Hence we have to create ingenious solutions to encourage people to avoid driving and take public transport. And soon we may have driver-less vehicles which will be able to do this job too.
There are many ways we can make Singapore's public transportation No. 1 in the world. If there is one country in the world that has the means and motivation to achieve this goal, it is Singapore.
So why don't we just get started?

","   Singaporeans still support free trade and investment, meritocracy and free enterprise, but want to see a greater emphasis on fairness in society
FOR a very long time, Singaporeans appear to have had a shared belief in the following values and principles:Free trade and investmentMarket economyGlobalisationForeign talentMeritocracy
Several recent events, however, have prompted thoughtful Singaporeans to wonder whether that consensus is breaking down.
Speaking in London on Thursday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong hinted at the problem.
Unlike many other global cities, he noted, Singapore has no hinterland. This made getting the balance ""between national identity and cosmopolitan openness, between free market competition and social solidarity"" especially important.
Are the stresses and strains associated with the drive to be a global city producing a potentially destabilising ideological cleavage?
Free trade and investment
I AM quite confident that Singaporeans believe in free trade and investment. Singaporeans know that our policy of free trade and investment, beginning in 1819, has brought jobs and prosperity. As a consequence, there is no protectionist sentiment in Singapore.
This explains why Singaporeans have reacted with equanimity when iconic landmarks, such as Raffles Hotel, and iconic brands and businesses, such as Robinsons, Tiger Beer and F&N, are sold to foreigners.
I wish, however, to make a point here. Singapore is a nation of traders, willing to sell such landmarks and icons without compunction. In that sense, Singapore is more like the British than the Swiss. The British have sold all their great auto companies to foreigners, while the great Swiss companies remain in the hands of the Swiss.
Do we want to be like the United Kingdom or Switzerland?
Market economy
SINGAPOREANS, unlike the Americans, are not an ideological people. They are pragmatists. They believe that both the private and public sectors have a legitimate role in the economy.
Singaporeans accept that the market economy is the most efficient model for the allocation of investment and for the production and distribution of goods and services, as well as for determining prices.
However, they also recognise that the market is imperfect and the Government has to intervene when there is market failure. Singaporeans do not believe in a winner-takes-all model of capitalism. They want the Government to intervene in order to ensure justice and fairness.
Singaporeans want to live in a market economy. They do not, however, want to live in a market society. That is, they do not want to live in a society in which everything is for sale, where everything is monetised, and where the making of money is a key performance indicator of both the private and public sectors.
Thoughtful Singaporeans remember the warning contained in one of the holy books that the love of money is the root of all evil. They fear that Singapore has already become or is in danger of becoming a market society.
Globalisation
GLOBALISATION is an irresistible force. It is driven by technology, open borders, human mobility, trade, capital, business, culture and religion.
Globalisation is both a force for good and a force for evil. Small and open economies, such as Singapore, have benefited enormously from globalisation. We should therefore support and defend globalisation.
One of our ambitions is to be a global city. To be a global city, our doors must be open to the inflow of people from all over the world. Our windows must be open to ideas from all quarters.
Singapore is, however, not just a city. It is also a country, a home for 3.5 million Singaporeans. Is it possible to be both a country and a global city? I think it is possible, but we have to manage the contradictions.
For example, we welcome the many wealthy foreigners who have come to live and work here or to buy a second or a third home. One negative consequence is that they have raised property prices and the cost of living.
Another example is the growing resentment felt by many Singaporeans that wealthy foreigners are free-riders. They come here to make money and lead very comfortable lives, but give little or nothing back in return. To make matters worse, some of them have a disrespectful attitude towards Singaporeans.
Foreign talent
AMERICAN business school gurus such as Dr Gary Hamel have managed to convince Singapore's leaders that there is a global competition for talent. In order to succeed, Singapore cannot rely only on its home-grown talent. It must look outward and recruit talented people from all over the world, to key positions in both our public and private sectors.
The hunt for foreign talent became a national obsession. As a result, Singapore was in danger of overlooking its own talent.
I am glad that there is a more balanced attitude today. This is the result of two developments. First, Singapore discovered that some so-called foreign talent was not really very talented. Second, there was the discovery that, in some cases, when a foreign chief executive officer was hired, he or she discriminated against Singaporeans when hiring staff.
My conclusion is that Singapore should continue to welcome foreign talent. But it should do so to complement Singaporean talent, not to supplant it. Everything being equal, Singapore should give priority to its own talent.
Meritocracy
ONE of the cardinal principles of Singapore's public policy is meritocracy. I believe that our adherence to meritocracy, together with a firm stance against corruption, is one of the secrets of Singapore's success.
My sense is that there has been no retreat from our commitment to these principles. Singaporeans do, however, have some concerns. They want to be assured that meritocracy is accompanied by social mobility.
They would be unhappy if talented children from humble families do not have the opportunity to rise to the top.
In order to level the playing field, most Singaporeans support the view that the Government should play a role to ensure that good quality and affordable childcare and early education are available to all Singaporeans, and not just to the rich.
Conclusion
IS THERE an ideological cleavage in Singapore? I do not think so. I think there is still a consensus to support free trade and investment, meritocracy and free enterprise.
I do not see a rejection of the market economy, but I do see a rejection of the market society.
People want to see a greater emphasis on fairness in our society.
I think the greatest challenge is to manage the contradictions between our ambition to be a global city and our ambition to make Singapore an inclusive society based on justice and equality.
But Singapore has to do a better job in managing the rising cost of living, the inflation of property prices and escalating rentals.
It is important to ensure Singaporeans continue to feel that this is their country, and foreigners, though welcome, are our guests.

"," Think
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Society
","   How is Singapore divided? Let us count the ways.
First, there are the established faultlines of race, language and religion.
The existential facts of Singapore society have not changed for our diverse, multi-faith, multi-ethnic community. Most of us are immensely proud of our polyglot yet coherent national identity, but we recognise that differences in worldviews remain.
Established rifts are like tectonic faultlines deep in the earth: they exist; we adapt; and we build civilisation around them. The greatest danger is to see only the surface and forget the rifts underneath.
Second, there are ""recognised rifts"": newer social divisions that have been recognised and are being dealt with, as the government adapts its policies to bridge these gaps.
These include the income gap, being tackled by the Workfare Income Supplement; setting minimum starting wages in the cleaning and security sectors; and getting companies to raise productivity to boost wages. Taxes have also been shifted to weight the burden more on the high-income group.
Another ""recognised rift"" is the gap in educational performance and opportunity between children from privileged homes and those from less advantaged homes. Broad-based pre-school subsidies help address this opportunity gap, as does the Education Ministry's attempt to level up all schools so there is no ""bad"" school anywhere. But more can be done to help level up poor children and those from broken families.
Even as Singapore recognises and grapples with established and recognised rifts, it must also keep a lookout for emerging rifts in our small, yet highly diverse and increasingly complex society.
I would argue that there are two sets of emerging rifts we ignore to our future peril: ideological rifts and regional divides.
In a recent thoughtful article for The Straits Times, Professor Tommy Koh asked if there is an ideological cleavage in Singapore. He concluded that there is still a consensus to support free trade and investment, meritocracy and free enterprise in Singapore. But there is a rejection of the ""market society"", he observed. ""People want to see a greater emphasis on fairness in our society.""
I agree with Prof Koh that people want more fairness.
But I also fear that there is a growing divergence in worldview centred on precisely that point: People have a different view of what constitutes fairness. And whether or not people think a system is fair depends on their life opportunities and their life prospects. That holds whether the system they have in mind is the current one of meritocracy in school, balloting of public housing, or access to subsidised health care.
The healthy will probably consider it unfair to pay higher premiums to subsidise the unhealthy.
Parents of straight-A students will find it unfair if their kids are denied the last place in a brand-name school that has been reserved for kids who exhibit special characteristics of drive, resilience or leadership from less advantaged homes.
As for housing, which is fairer? Build five-room subsidised flats first for a young couple in their 20s, who have good jobs paying a joint monthly income of $10,000, so they can move out of their respective parents' condos to set up home together?
Or give priority to building two-room subsidised flats so that a woman in her 50s with no family, who never married because she was caring for aged sick parents before they died, who earns $2,000 a month of which $800 goes to a rental room, can have a home?
Ironically, as the Government becomes more flexible in its policies, responding to and adapting to a more diverse set of needs, the contestation and competition among citizens to have their special needs attended to and prioritised will get stronger. And each group will argue: It's only fair to attend to me.
As for regional rifts, I have long wondered if geography will become another divide, if the part of Singapore we live in shapes our education and job choice, health and outlook.
Enclaves can of course be good things, although over-concentrations of people can pose law-and-order problems. Enclaves give rise to identity and interesting local culture. Think of Little India and Geylang, with foreign workers, food and booze. Joo Chiat's food haunts; Tiong Bahru's un-self-conscious urban chic charm; or Holland Village's cosmopolitan-heartland buzz.
Beyond these known enclaves, are there other regional rifts? For example, in areas in the west of the island close to industrial estates, is the air quality worse? Do western denizens suffer worse health outcomes? As regional health clusters develop, this data can be gleaned.
Are regional variations developing in income trends? Household structure? Ideological views? Are there more low-income people living in Jurong West than in the central and eastern districts? Are there differences in school performance by region?
If so, what are the implications?
Some of these data can be found on the government's onemap portal, a geospatial initiative that breaks down population data by planning area.
Indeed, it shows there are many more people whose monthly income is below $1,500 in Jurong West (31,382) than in Tanglin (479). But the west doesn't have an undue concentration of low-income workers. The clearer pattern is that many low-income workers live far from the city centre, in Bedok (33,469) and Woodlands (28,867). Near the city centre, Bukit Merah, a very old Housing Board estate, is an exception with its 21,510 low-wage workers.
This throws up another emerging rift: that between people who can afford life in the city and its fringes and those relegated to the more far-flung heartland estates.
Will higher-paying jobs in the city centre be out of reach of those in Jurong West and Woodlands, no thanks to long commutes? If some get jobs in swanky Orchard, are food options there affordable?
As Bukit Merah's Housing Board residents age and die, will it be only the very rich who will be able to afford living in the city-centre, given the absence of new public housing?
In Singapore's early years, racial riots erupted, aided by race-based living enclaves. HDB estates then sprang up, and have become bastions of communities that cut across race, religion and income.
It's important, as Singapore's city-centre becomes ever more global and cosmopolitan - and pricey - that attention is paid to emerging geospatial rifts. Big Data can tell us stories about those emerging rifts. But first we must be looking for them to spot the trends.

143,"Besides the racial component, other factors affect our harmony.

"," Forum Letters
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Severe acute respiratory syndrome
","   PROFESSOR Kishore Mahbubani has offered three narratives to strengthen the Singapore spirit (""Three stories to strengthen the Singapore spirit""; last Saturday).
Tied to the success narrative is meritocracy. But this has been challenged by ""parentocracy"", where students get ahead because of parents with more resources (""Beware growing 'parentocracy': NIE don""; March 30). This concept is not new, given how parental affiliations have played a part in primary school registration, and should be guarded against.
In his harmony narrative, Prof Mahbubani focused on racial harmony. This has been reinforced by laws such as the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act and the healthy interaction between members of different races.
Besides the racial component, other factors affect our harmony.
One is the divide between locals and foreign labour - both lower-skilled and high-level workers.
Another is the tension between various activist groups, such as the gay community and religious groups, which came to the fore during the recent spat over the Health Promotion Board's frequently asked questions on sexuality.
At a time when activist groups are becoming more vocal in pushing their agendas, the authorities must listen to their arguments and treat them fairly.
As for Prof Mahbubani's last narrative, caring can be divided into two categories - care provided by the Government, and that between Singaporeans.
The Pioneer Generation Package is an example of the former. This is a right step, given that Singapore has to find ways to care for its vulnerable groups, while avoiding becoming a welfare state.
The greater challenge lies in fostering care between citizens.
Singapore is noted for its quality ""hardware"" and lack of ""software"". This has been magnified and, in some cases, distorted by social media, where photos of commuters not giving up their seats on public transport to those who need them are routinely shared on websites.
There seems to be an inevitable trade-off between economic growth and compassion. But there is no point in having bountiful growth if residents are unhappy.
Another narrative to add to those suggested by Prof Mahbubani is resilience. This was illustrated in how we handled the severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis in 2003.
Today's youth can also derive inspiration from the fighting spirit of the pioneer generation, who laid the foundations for an independent Singapore.
Prof Mahbubani was gracious in acknowledging that no nation's history is perfect. Every student should read up on Singapore's history, including sensitive topics like Operation Coldstore that are not found in school textbooks.
Our history reminds our youth that success comes at a price and nation building is never perfect.

","   TWO Singaporeans have written a book that argues against the way the Singapore Government provides housing and social support, and questions how it has dealt with values such as meritocracy and identity.
At the launch of the book Hard Choices: Challenging The Singapore Consensus at the National University of Singapore (NUS) UTown yesterday, its two authors Donald Low and Sudhir Vadaketh said they wanted to encourage Singaporeans to question the beliefs and practices that have become hard truths in the public policy arena.
Hard Truths is also the title of a book by former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew.
Elaborating on this, Mr Low said: ""We think that policymakers, and Singaporeans in general, should be less guided by hard truths, the ideologies, policies and practices that have served us well in the past 30 to 40 years, and be more guided by this idea that perhaps there are few hard truths, there are very few eternal truths.
""The far more meaningful debate we should be having is what are the choices we realistically have.""
He is the associate dean for executive education and research at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, and a former civil servant.
One such choice is whether Singapore must be a global city, said Mr Vadaketh.
He said the antagonism towards foreigners in Singapore is a result of tensions between those who see Singapore as a global city with a global identity and those who want it to have a more local identity.
Mr Low, 40, and Mr Vadaketh, 36, wrote most of the 15 essays in the book, which also includes contributions from Dr Linda Lim, professor of strategy at the University of Michigan, and Dr Thum Ping Tjin, research fellow at the Asia Research Institute in NUS. The book is published by NUS Press.
Mr Low said he hoped for a return of ""the debate that used to characterise the Singapore Government"" but had been ""sucked out of the system"" because of the Government's success.
He cited a 1972 speech by former deputy prime minister Goh Keng Swee that raised concerns over Singapore's continued reliance on foreign investments and foreign workers for economic growth. ""I think we have regressed.""

","   AT HIS book launch earlier this year, former civil service head Lim Siong Guan made a simple but profound observation.
Choosing the best person for the job is not an absolute carved in stone, as ""meritocracy has to be with respect to who is best for the position to deliver what you expect of the position"", he said.
The implication: As what is expected of a position changes, so too should the definition of merit and who is ""best for the job"".
I was reminded of what Mr Lim said after the Administrative Service's and People's Action Party's (PAP) potential new faces came under the spotlight recently.
Much has been made of how Singapore is at an ""inflection point"", with major developments like the social shift in policies and the changing face of local politics.
But one aspect that may have been glossed over is that these changes have huge implications on what public servants and politicians are now expected to deliver.
This calls for a fundamental rethink of what merit means, both in terms of who is ""best for the job"" and how they can emerge.
The roles of public servants and politicians should not be conflated, but it seems to me that in rethinking what being ""best for the job"" means, both entities face similar challenges.
One is whether their definitions of merit allow for enough diversity and plurality.
As authors Donald Low and Sudhir Thomas Vadaketh note in the introduction to their new book Hard Choices: Challenging The Singapore Consensus, as Singapore's operating context becomes more complex and the polity becomes more heterogeneous, there should also be an increase in the diversity of ideas considered.
The other challenge is whether those deemed to be best for the job can avoid the perception of being out of touch.
Speaking during the Budget debate in March, Potong Pasir MP Sitoh Yih Pin cautioned that such a perception can lead to communication breaking down as ""people around you cannot see themselves having an engaging relationship with you that is based on mutual understanding and respect"".
These challenges affect the public service and the ruling party in different ways. Take the public service. A longstanding issue has been that the thinkers who formulate policies - often scholarship holders and Administrative Service officers - are frequently viewed as more valued than the doers who do the implementing.
However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that this artificial divide is not viable. At the Administrative Service dinner in March, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam and civil service head Peter Ong took pains to remind officers of the importance of policy implementation and execution.
The ability to execute policies well will become even more crucial as the Government rolls out more social measures like the Pioneer Generation Package, where policies are only as good as the tangible benefits that people feel.
Such measures will require authentic knowledge of how Singaporeans lead their daily lives, compassion and the human touch. They also call for different perspectives, backgrounds and skills from a public servant who formulates big-picture policies for trade and the economy - traditionally seen as the more prestigious Administrative Service postings.
Moulmein-Kallang GRC MP Denise Phua told The Straits Times earlier this year: ""In a day and age where ideas are a dime a dozen, the key people who are going to make a difference are the ones who turn them into reality.""
The question is whether such doers are recognised for their merit, and if those with different backgrounds and abilities can enter and prove themselves in the upper echelons of the public service.
What's encouraging is that the public service appears to be aware of these changing expectations and is evolving to meet this different policy environment.
Public Service Commission chairman Eddie Teo, for instance, has been championing the need to recruit students from diverse backgrounds as scholarship holders.
Mr Teo told The Straits Times last month that he sees positive changes in younger officers. They are more keen to take on operational postings and are more interested in joining the social sector, not just the economic. ""I like to think that this is the result of changes in Singapore - that our younger officers now worry more about social issues and have an intrinsic empathy for the ground, and a more caring attitude towards the less fortunate,"" he said.
On the other hand, the changing expectations of politicians, particularly those from the ruling party, are less easy to decipher.
The PAP recently broke with tradition by allowing potential new faces to be seen in action at constituency events much earlier in the election cycle than usual.
The move is in line with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's pledge of a ""new PAP for a new era"" after the 2011 General Election, when he highlighted the need for a more diverse slate and for candidates to be tested out on the ground earlier. Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, the PAP's organising secretary, also said recently the party especially values candidates with grassroots experience.
It would appear that the PAP is responding to signals from the electorate that the past formula of excellent qualifications is no longer enough to be considered ""best for the job"" of an MP.
Last year's Punggol East by-election was a good example of how people's expectations have changed. Voters rewarded the Workers' Party (WP) for fielding a young woman with a heartlander background, who had proven herself by rising through the party ranks and walking the ground over two election campaigns. In contrast, the PAP man was viewed as the usual high-flying professional who had been parachuted in at the last minute.
Fast forward to today, and the potential PAP new faces who have been soft-launched - they include a lawyer, research scientist and economist - are already facing similar criticism for being cast from the same mould and the same old definition of merit.
On one level, voters do appear to value politicians who are ""one of us"", someone they can relate to as an equal rather than in a top-down fashion. But I would argue that voters' expectations are more complex than that.
One phenomenon in 2011 was that opposition parties were lauded for fielding high-fliers and elite former scholarship holders, while the PAP was slammed for being out of touch when it trotted out candidates of a similar ilk.
It is not just a matter of double standards. In Singapore's political context, the high-flier who joins the opposition can symbolise, to the voter, courage and the willingness to buck the trend.
Conversely, the WP's decision to field Ms Lee Li Lian over more conventionally qualified WP members can also be read as a sign of conviction and commitment.
What this says to me is that voters also expect politicians to appeal to their ideals, such as by displaying moral courage or passionate commitment.
I would argue that even as the PAP casts its net wider for candidates who fit these changing expectations, it should also dig deeper for that spark of boldness and conviction. This means looking beyond a person's background and paper qualifications for other qualities such as empathy, lots of heart, and the drive to truly connect with people and patiently till the ground. These are attributes it should play up in a decisive way, beyond the pragmatic image of technocratic excellence that it has honed over the years.
In this brave new world of governance and politics, that may well be the new definition of merit and ""best for the job"".

"," The Straits Times; Singapore
",NA,"   It was late morning and I had boarded bus No. 73 for my daily commute to the office. I tapped my ez-link card on the reader and discovered to my surprise that there was not enough money stored in it to cover my fare.
I dug into my wallet, only to find I had neither coins nor $2 notes.
As the bus trundled on, I stumbled along the aisle asking fellow passengers if they could help me break a $10 note. None could.
Just as I was about to give up and pay $10 for the short ride from Serangoon Gardens to Toa Payoh, two people sprang up and offered to pay my fare for me.
One was a woman in her 40s wearing a shade too much makeup and clothes a tad loud and revealing for her age, someone I would usually have disapproved of at first sight.
But there she was, holding out her coin purse and asking me how much I needed. I looked more closely and saw the kindness in her face and eyes.
The other was a bespectacled man in ill-fitting jeans and polo shirt, who dug out a spare ez-link card from his large haversack and asked me to use it.
He also gave me some advice: I should always carry two ez-link cards as he did, so I would not have this problem again.
He was inarticulate but sincere. I gladly accepted both his spare card and advice.
I was reminded of this incident a few weeks ago when I read Dr William Wan's commentary in this newspaper, ""It's time to update the kampung spirit"", in which he encouraged us to look on our neighbours as ""friends in waiting"".
Dr Wan, who is the general secretary of the Singapore Kindness Movement, wrote: ""As traditional kinship support weakens, and as our population ages, we need to build bonding communities in which people living near one another are able to give and receive help when needed. It must start with a recognition that we are mutually dependent on those who live around us.""
To be honest, if I had not run out of money on my ez-link card that morning, I doubt I would have found much in common with my fellow passengers on bus No. 73, much less thought that I would need to depend on any of them for help.
One of the downsides of living in a rich country is that we have far less need to rely on one another. When we can pay for what we need, we no longer have to depend on the kindness of neighbours and strangers.
So the occasions to get to know one another, to establish ties, to discover what we may have in common, are also diminished.
But seeking common ground is precisely what we need to do as differences in incomes, nationality, political and religious beliefs threaten to pull us further apart.
We need to build solidarity - a sense that we are all in this together, playing on the same team as we face the challenges that life throws up; a sense that there is more that binds us than divides us.
And that solidarity is all the more important as Singapore moves towards social policies that will involve greater risk pooling, such as MediShield Life, and more redistribution of the rewards of economic growth.
These policies cannot work as they are intended to if the social paradigm is every man for himself.
Take MediShield Life as an example. It is a universal health-care insurance scheme that, when launched next year, will cover every Singaporean for life.
The premise of this scheme is that none of us knows what illness or calamity might strike us and when.
Instead of going it alone, which would leave those on lower incomes struggling to pay for health care, and many of us at risk of having our savings wiped out by a catastrophic illness, MediShield Life is a way for everyone in society to pool their risks and share the costs of medical care.
It will mean that some people who pay a lot into the scheme, which is compulsory, may end up claiming very little if they remain healthy.
Others may claim more than they put in, especially if they are already old or sickly.
It is a scheme that depends on everyone chipping in, as the Prime Minister said in a Facebook post in March to mark the end of the Budget debate.
Mr Lee Hsien Loong zoomed in on the Government's plans to strengthen social safety nets and described MediShield Life as a key initiative.
""MediShield Life depends on everyone chipping in to share the burden, to take collective responsibility to protect one another,"" he said, adding: ""While MediShield Life gives us peace of mind for our health costs, let's all do our part to stay healthy and avoid getting sick. This is the best way to keep health costs low, live long and live well.""
So what would help build the solidarity that this society needs to thrive?
Shared public spaces are a good starting point; parks, hawker centres, and buses and trains are where Singaporeans come face to face with one another.
People also need opportunities to interact, to work and play together, to discover what they can do together that they cannot do alone. The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth is taking a stab at growing these opportunities through events such as the annual Community Games, but just as important is giving civil society the space it needs to flourish.
Another change that must take place is the removal of social structures that undermine solidarity.
In a chapter in his new book Hard Choices, Mr Donald Low sheds light on some of these structures as he provides an insightful critique of Singapore's meritocracy.
He contrasts meritocratic competition based on absolute performance and that based on relative position.
The first sets up a positive-sum game that adds to society's well-being. One example of this is the Singapore Armed Forces' Individual Physical Proficiency Test.
The second sets up a zero-sum game where everyone tries to outdo each other in the hope of securing the rewards that accrue only to those at the top. An example of this is the way the education system often grades students on a curve, or ranks them, as in the case of the Primary School Leaving Examination and its T-score.
To build solidarity, we need to do away with forms of competition that encourage people to see each other as foes in waiting, rather than as friends.

","   EDUCATION Minister Heng Swee Keat's determination to stick to the decision not to name the top scorers of national examinations, including the Primary School Leaving Examination, reiterates the new direction of Singapore's education system. This, as he made clear at The Straits Times' inaugural Education Forum last week, includes debunking the idea among some parents that education equals grades, when in reality, intangibles such as character and values matter a great deal. Mr Heng's emphasis on these qualities is a reminder that grades are a means to the next stage of the education system or to working life; they are not the end of education and certainly not of life.
The purpose of education must lie in providing a sound academic foundation for the development of a rounded and confident individual. Such a person would be capable, not only of participating in the economy as an educated and motivated worker but in society as well, as a thoughtful and engaged citizen. By contrast, an unhealthy fixation with scores limits the mental horizons of even the best students; demoralises those who perform less well; and subjects all to the crushing power of expectations. There is a danger of producing one-examination wonders - stars who believe that their future is foretold in their success - even as lesser mortals are overwhelmed by the fear of sinking into mediocrity. Singapore's young deserve much better.
While meritocracy is essential in education, and while examinations are one way of gauging merit, success in life demands other attributes. Mr Heng, a high-flying public servant before he entered politics, noted that he had crossed paths with many top performers at their jobs who did not have top grades. What distinguished them were their leadership skills. This was a good illustration of the point that the key to success lies in picking up and honing skills while meeting challenges, including the ability to get along and work well with others, as well as show empathy for all.
Whether the young view examinations as a part of a process of living and growing would depend on the support they receive from their parents. If parents themselves see education as a zero- sum game, they are unlikely to inspire their children with a holistic attitude to learning and life. The truth is that education does not guarantee a good future but should be a good preparation for it. Innovation, creativity, social skills and the ability to learn on the job will be skills demanded even more of all in the years to come. Examination grades will matter only up to a point. High academic standards would continue to be critical but their purpose would be to equip Singaporeans to meet the evolving challenges of life.

"," Income distribution; Income inequality; Generations; Capitalism
","   AS ECONOMISTS and politicians reshape the conversation on inequality, Singapore, a year ahead of its 50th birthday, has big decisions to make.
The momentum to fight rising inequality has never been greater, and the choices we make will define our future.
If we continue with things as they are, the chances are that we will get the same results that we have seen in the past.
Professor Thomas Piketty, a French economist, has presented undeniable evidence that a country that continues to rely on the capitalist model will always end with an unequal society.
His 700-page tome, Capital In The 21st Century, examines the growth of inequality using decades of hard data.
His conclusion is that the return on capital outpaces economic growth, so those who own capital will get richer faster than those who do not.
That does not bode well when economic growth slows - a phenomenon facing Singapore.
Prof Piketty's evidence that capitalism fundamentally leads to increasing inequality in income and wealth has implications for Singapore.
When this wealth is passed on from generation to generation, the gap grows, widening also the inequalities in access to opportunities, and to social networks.
Thus the fears here of a growing ""parentocracy"", where parents' wealth and social capital have greater bearing on a child's success than the child's own abilities.
While income inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, is high, wealth inequality has not been measured officially and I have argued in these pages before that it could be much higher than the income gap because of wealth accumulated over generations.
There are few studies on social mobility here, but the last known one by the Ministry of Finance in 2012 warned that while mobility was high, it may not be the case in the future.
Former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew remarked too in 2012 that students from educated families were increasingly taking places in the top schools, sounding a warning on increased social stratification.
Prof Piketty's findings shake the core of the very foundations Singapore is built on - a belief in the meritocracy of opportunities for success regardless of background.
Is there really such a thing as a meritocracy if one's success is inherently determined by inter-generational wealth that remains largely in the same hands? On the other hand, there is not yet a credible alternative system to capitalism for organising an economy.
These twin obstacles make President Tony Tan Keng Yam's Address last Friday all the more important.
While he did not speak on Prof Piketty's findings specifically, they were at the heart of his call to renew our pledge to build a better, brighter Singapore.
It is why the Government is pledging to create a nation of opportunities, and to keep pathways upwards open to all.
It is why too it has pledged to strengthen social safety nets by better spreading out the fruits of success through redistribution.
""Those who do not succeed at first should have a second chance, indeed must always have the chance to try again,"" Dr Tan said.
""We want an open and inclusive society, where all have opportunities to learn, and to earn our own success; where we respect fellow Singaporeans, regardless of social status, for the worth we see in everyone, and where we interact formally with one another free of rigid social hierarchy.""
But the changes must go beyond rhetoric.
It threads through our education system, the economy, politics, families and communities.
So this cannot be a political mantra of the Government's alone. It must be the genuine aspiration of all Singaporeans.
A whole-hearted rethinking of what Singapore represents is needed. So here is my response to the President's call to renew my pledge to building a better Singapore. It is what I hope my country can aspire to be.
Our schools produce students who care about their country and the world, who travel and explore, who dare to dream and fail.
Their lives are not determined by the schools they go to before they are 18, or indeed after that, but how they are moulded as people of character and compassion.
Their experience in school is not summed up by their PSLE score or the grades and medals won, but by the friends they have made, the challenges they have overcome and the lives they have touched through social projects they worked on at home or abroad.
Our best and brightest are given bond-free scholarships by the public service. They come back to serve because they want to, not because they have to.
Our political leaders have varied backgrounds and have expertise beyond economics, or business or the sciences. Some are musicians or artists, or authors and poets, others have failed many times in their lives as entrepreneurs.
Our economy is diverse and vibrant, made of sectors in which stakeholders invest, not for pure profit but also for how much the sectors contribute back to society.
We buy a home to live in, not to invest in and flip in the next big property boom. Instead, Singaporeans get rich by building their own companies that make products to improve lives.
Companies and foreigners come to Singapore not because it is the most clean and efficient city with low taxes, but because every company and individual that invests in Singapore is investing in a country that stands for social good. In fact we are a hub for social innovation, drawing entrepreneurs from all over the world to develop solutions to global social challenges.
Income and wealth tax rates are much higher. But there is also widespread philanthropy from the private sector and individuals. The global wealthy pledge themselves to a worldwide giving initiative started by a Singapore businessman.
This is because we are a society that understands that there are those who just cannot do as well the first time round, and who deserve many chances to grow and learn from mistakes, and succeed.
As a result, we top the rankings not just in Doing Business but also in Global Giving.
Above all, Singaporeans are known around the world not as intelligent, efficient, calculating machines, but as an open-minded, generous and optimistic people.
So when Dr Tan began his speech by saying Singapore is at an important moment in its history - he was right.
But it is important not just because we are about to mark 50 whole years of independence.
It is important because we have a chance to make in the next 50 years a Singapore we are proud of, a nation built not on wealth, competition and rewards, but on generosity, compassion and service.
Let us pledge ourselves to that.

","   IN A light-hearted moment in yesterday's Parliament debate, Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC) put on his doctor's hat to dispense eight healthy living tips that he said would ""guarantee a better life... confirmed"".
His prescription list drew equal amounts of laughter and appreciation from a group of the more senior Cabinet ministers, as the House yesterday turned its attention to tackling the very serious issue of an ageing Singapore.
Whether ageing can be an opportunity to be embraced or an obstacle that will slow Singapore down was a theme of yesterday's sitting - the second day of debate on the President's Address - in which 17 MPs rose to share their views.
With the Government unveiling recently a slew of health-care measures from the new Medishield Life universal medical insurance to improved subsidies and schemes like the Community Health Assist Scheme, several MPs raised concerns on health-care financing and consumption.
Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar GRC) cautioned that health care should be utilised appropriately.
""This is not just about dollars and cents, but unwarranted health-care use may do us more harm than good,"" he said.
He cited a state in the United States where people were randomly selected to be given expanded medical insurance through a lottery system. Believing the system would make them healthier, it instead led them to make more visits to the doctor.
Non-Constituency MP Gerald Giam said he hoped the Government would take on more risks in health-care financing by subsidising premiums and removing claim limits under the new Medishield Life universal medical insurance.
But when he said that it was relatively easy to predict medical insurance payouts, he drew sardonic laughter from some members of the House and a swift rebuttal from Dr Puthucheary and Health Minister Gan Kim Yong that it was very difficult to forecast costs, due to drivers like technology, ageing and ease of access.
But beyond the debate on improving how medical costs can be financed, Mr Gan sought to make the House appreciate that ageing is a blessing.
""While we speak of the challenges of an ageing population, we should not forget that ageing and longevity is a blessing. We are all living longer and that is a good thing. But we must plan ahead to help Singaporeans age successfully and meaningfully,"" he said.
He announced plans to build a ""Nation for all Ages"" with a national agenda that would enable people to live meaningful lives as they age.
This masterplan will cover education, employment, volunteerism, urban infrastructure, health care, retirement adequacy and research into ageing.
Similarly, Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor sought to provide assurances that growing old in Singapore does not need to be feared.
She vowed that there will be improvements to the Central Provident Fund system. Suggestions over the past two days for higher returns, higher contribution rates for older workers, and more ways for retirees to monetise their homes will be considered, she promised.
However it was not just the ageing of Singaporeans that was the focus of the debate, but the ageing of Singapore as a nation and society, as several MPs addressed longevity of another kind.
As Singapore reaches its 50th year of independence, the MPs called on society, institutions and the approach to politics to evolve in order for the nation's maturation not to be a burden but a boon.
Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade GRC) made a heartfelt plea to keep the system of meritocracy, and not hold back the best and brightest just for ""some misguided sense of social fairness"".
But this meritocracy must be tempered by compassion and a sense of community, she said.
Nominated MP Laurence Lien said the Government needs to improve its relationship with civil society by having regular strategic dialogues to discuss social problems, and having more transparency over data and research.
Civil society itself must also do more to tackle the root causes of problems and not just their symptoms, he said, and to have discourse that is civil, he added.
A changing political climate also demands evolution in institutions and the approach to politics said a few MPs.
Ms Denise Phua (Moulmein-Kallang GRC) repeated a call for the elected presidency to be scrapped, arguing that voters should have to live with their decisions, and also proposed reforms to strengthen the civil service to prepare for a future of ""revolving-door politics"".
But she also urged an examination of and agreement on ""some fundamentals as a people so that indeed the best days lie ahead"", such as the principle of work before welfare.
Dr Puthucheary used the challenges in the medical profession as an analogy to describe the dangers of politics and how debate and disagreement may not always result in the best outcome for the country.
""You don't have to look very far or very hard for examples where short-term policy interest or short-term electoral interest has meant that the long-term health of a nation has not been served, where the attempts to reform a public health-care system for the greater good have been blocked by the pursuit of electoral advantage,"" he said.
From yesterday's debate, whether it is in health care, the social compact or political contestation, it appears that all MPs agree that as Singapore gets older, the challenges it will face will get more difficult and complicated.
But Dr Khor offered a different perspective as she reflected on her own ageing.
Quoting the late Catholic writer Henri Nouwen, she said: ""Ageing is not a reason for despair, but a basis for hope, not a slow decaying but a gradual maturing, not a fate to be undergone but a chance to be embraced"".
Similarly, as Singapore gets to 50 and beyond, this ageing should not be cause for despair, but should be embraced as a chance to change and improve.

","   OVER five days, six ministers and 60 MPs debated President Tony Tan Keng Yam's Address at the opening of the 12th Parliament's second session, that focused on the Government's plans for the rest of its term.
They sparred robustly, among other things, over what constructive politics means, and offered several suggestions on how the CPF scheme can be improved.
Mr Zaqy Mohamad, who started the debate on Monday, wrapped up the motion of thanks with a speech that highlighted the various key points raised by the MPs. He noted there was a general recognition of the Government's efforts in addressing people's immediate concerns.
""This government has clearly shown that it is about the people and for the people,"" he said.
Concluding his speech, he called on everyone to work together ""to make the lives of Singaporeans better, shape Singapore to be an even better place to live in and leave a lasting legacy for our future generations"".
Here is a look back at some of the key themes and what was said about them.
CONSTRUCTIVE POLITICS
PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG
""We have policies to create a better Singapore for the future. But the key to realising these policies is to get our politics right... Politics cannot just be about politics alone because Singaporeans' lives and our futures are at stake. Constructive politics can help us to scale new heights. Wrong politics will doom us... Constructive politics depends on what we as political leaders do, how we act, the decisions we make, the standards we hold ourselves to. It does not just depend on institutions or culture or a general environment - something vague which I have no control of but causes me to do what I am doing.""
- On why constructive politics matters
WORKERS' PARTY CHIEF LOW THIA KHIANG (ALJUNIED GRC)
""To me, in whatever ways politics is described and coloured, it is still politics. What is important is the outcome of the political process... Constructive politics does not happen by the order of the Government. Nor does it happen through a national conversation or public consultation.""
- On whether the term ""constructive politics"" is rhetoric
DR JANIL PUTHUCHEARY (PASIR RIS-PUNGGOL GRC)
""When you fail to acknowledge the good, when you avoid discussion of consequences and trade-offs, when you spend a whole speech attacking one point you disagree with and fail to support all the other points you should agree with... these are not the markers of good politics, no matter how much debate and diversity of opinion they reflect.""
- On why a diversity of opinions alone is not good politics
THE FUTURE OF AGEING
HEALTH MINISTER GAN KIM YONG
""Ageing is a conversation that involves all of us - our aspirations for our silver years, how we hope to live our lives to the fullest, how we wish to relate to peers and younger persons, and the kind of society we wish to live in when we grow old... Let us now change the conversation about ageing - from worrying about the challenges that come from ageing to celebrating longevity.""
- On the national effort to prepare Singaporeans for successful ageing
DR CHIA SHI-LU (TANJONG PAGAR GRC)
""Singapore is growing old, and her people are growing old even more quickly. But as I have said on many occasions, growing old is not something to be feared but to be embraced.""
- On growing old healthily and happily
MAKING CPF BETTER
MANPOWER MINISTER TAN CHUAN-JIN
""Mr Png Eng Huat... cited an example about his father looking forward with excitement in his eyes upon turning 55 in the past. I can understand that, but I think that excitement in the eyes would turn into a look of horror if we didn't make adjustments because life expectancy is increasing... and you begin to realise that your money is beginning to run out.""
- Replying to Workers' Party MP Png, on why it is not prudent to let people withdraw all their CPF savings when they turn 55
SECURING OUR HOME
DEFENCE MINISTER NG ENG HEN
""Why did we form the Committee to Strengthen NS, when public support was so high?... The simple answer is that this would be the best time to conduct the review to ensure NS remains responsive and relevant to a new generation of Millennial national servicemen who will defend Singapore. Better to hear them now and adjust policies, rather than wait and assume previous policies will work even when circumstances have changed.""
- On keeping National Service relevant at a time when many countries have abolished their conscription programmes
CLOSING DIVIDES
MS SYLVIA LIM (ALJUNIED GRC)
""The rich and the poor access the criminal justice system differently. While the rich have the resources to engage expensive lawyers... the poor have to make decisions based on their means. This sometimes includes pleading guilty, when they do not have the time or resources to contest their charges.""
- On giving the poor greater access to justice
NOMINATED MP EUGENE TAN
""Is my alma mater (Raffles Institution), one that I am immensely proud of, less of a beacon of hope of Singapore's meritocracy? It does not seem to attract as many neighbourhood schools and Malay students as it ought to. Has its ethos changed such that RI has become forbidding in this regard?""

","   A WEEK-LONG debate on the President's Address ended yesterday with Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang GRC) reminding the House that ""our work does not end here"".
In all, 60 MPs and six ministers made their cases on many important issues, from education to the elderly, and the type of politics that is good for Singapore.
The issues raised this week focused almost entirely on social needs, illustrating the continued shift in the Government's policies.
One big concern was retirement adequacy. Many MPs voiced their desire for the Government to improve the Central Provident Fund (CPF) system, as more people age and cost of living goes up.
Another issue that got a lot of MPs fired up was whether the system of meritocracy is working as it should, given concerns over inequality of access to good schools and jobs.
The Government listened, and put forward its own case, with a pledge to do more to address concerns in these areas.
The issue that drew the most attention and heat was that of constructive politics.
Workers' Party secretary-general Low Thia Khiang devoted his entire speech to it, engendering rebuttals from PAP MPs.
Mr Low questioned if the PAP government was building an environment for constructive politics and called for efforts to enable a more robust political process, ""to cultivate political norms and to build an environment for constructive engagement in politics"".
This in turn was flipped on its head as the PAP questioned the WP's contribution to constructive politics, and said it lacked honesty and integrity in not admitting
that it had shifted its stance on foreign workers, and in its management of contracts at its town council.
The most memorable moment of the week was the near 15-minute war of words between PM Lee and Mr Low on Wednesday.
Yesterday, two PAP MPs - Mr Cedric Foo (Pioneer) and Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast GRC) - continued to raise questions about the WP's stance on immigration and foreign workers.
The back and forth between the parties livened up proceedings, but it was unfortunate that it took away time to discuss the broader aspects of Singapore's political system and the space for political participation.
Yesterday, two office holders made a pitch to show that the Government is encouraging more space for community and civic participation.
Minister of State for Education Sim Ann spoke of the need for a ""collective understanding"" of Singapore's circumstances, the importance of mutual respect and tolerance, and the need to secure peace and prosperity.
""We wish for every generation of Singaporeans to find the right balance between individual achievement and collective achievement,"" she said.
""We want our students to be good citizens, with a heart for Singapore, compassion for others, and gratitude to those who have helped build their lives.""
It was a view shared by Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong.
Mr Wong is spearheading a new Youth Corps initiative to support young people in their community projects, and had a simple message - join us!
The heart of a ""healthy democracy"" is the ""collective engagement of an active citizenry for the public good"", he said.
This means encouraging young Singaporeans to get involved in causes and projects that help build a better society.
Also, to aspire for ""Singapore to be a problem-solving democracy, a democracy of deeds"".
These calls to action should be welcomed.
But even so, some would argue that the Government's increased openness towards civic participation does not yet extend to the political arena.
Critics often point to the group representation constituency system, the regular redrawing of electoral boundaries, the neutrality of grassroots organisations, and the Government's perceived heavy-handedness in dealing with opponents and detractors.
It was a pity these issues were not taken up more fully by MPs, who thereby passed up on an opportunity to go deeper into the question of not just what constructive politics is, but how to foster a political culture that best serves Singapore's interests.
Getting Singapore's politics right is critical, as many MPs noted, since politics undergirds everything that can go right or wrong with the country.
No doubt, with Parliament having kicked off its second half on this note, there will be many more occasions to return to this issue in the rest of the term.

","   FOREIGN banks here say they are committed to developing a Singaporean core, stepping up efforts to groom and keep local talent.
Their comments came as Deputy Prime Minister and chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam said at a banking industry event last night that Singaporeans have to develop skills to prepare for the financial world of tomorrow.
Standard Chartered Bank and UBS said Singaporean staff are core to their operations and they regularly engage highly rated and highly valued local employees.
They do it to find out how employees' career aspirations can be met and to keep them in the company as well as the industry.
At UBS, of the over 2,000 employees in its Singapore office, more than 75 per cent are Singaporeans or permanent residents.
The bank said it has many Singaporean bankers who hold senior regional appointments. Among them are Mr Edmund Koh, the Singapore country head and chief executive of UBS Wealth Management's South-east Asia and Asia Pacific hub; Mr Gan Seow Ann, vice-chairman of the hub; and Ms Yeoh Choo Guan, head of Asean client trading and execution as well as head of Singapore equities.
Mr Koh said: ""It is important to nurture more Singaporean bankers for the finance industry here and the region, particularly as Singapore gains greater importance as a global financial centre.
""While UBS' human resource policies continue to be based on meritocracy and the best person for the role, we are committed to recruiting, developing and retaining Singapore talent.""
Meanwhile, StanChart engages its staff regularly through feedback sessions and its internal surveys show there is strong demand for tailor-made training and mentorship programmes.
""I joined the bank in 1995 and spent the past 19 years learning from great mentors at different stages of my career,"" said Mr Gary Tan, its head of financial markets here. ""Now I am able to contribute and make a difference by sharing what I have learnt and helping colleagues in the way my mentors helped me in the past.""
Singaporeans and PRs make up some 82 per cent of the 10,000- strong staff at Citibank.
Its Singapore country officer Michael Zink said: ""Just as we are fully supportive of developing local talent, it is equally important to have some foreign talent with global perspectives, expertise and skills to complement the overall development of Singapore as an international financial hub.""
Some Singaporeans believe there is still a bias against locals at some foreign banks. Ms D. Tan, a public relations executive who declined to give her full name, said her husband was passed over for promotion following the appointment of a foreigner as the boss.
Robert Half Singapore managing director Stella Tang noted: ""Most of the foreigners employed by banks and financial institutions here are in mid- or top-level roles, where their skills are relatively niche and difficult to find in Singapore.""

","   KUALA LUMPUR - A company controlled by power-to-property tycoon Francis Yeoh has taken the unusual move of pulling out of a RM3 billion (S$1.16 billion) contract it had been awarded to build a power plant in Johor after he was heavily criticised for saying at a forum that most of his projects are done overseas minus Malaysia's ""crony capitalism"".
His company, YTL Power International, together with a company reportedly linked to a powerful Johor politician were awarded the contract without going through a tender process. Critics, including former premier Mahathir Mohamad, indicated that the businessman had made his money in Malaysia by getting sweetheart government deals.
""We are thankful to the government for having confidence in YTL Power, as part of the consortium, to deliver the project on a fast track basis,"" YTL Power said in a media statement.
""However, in view of the misconception over the project, YTL Power has decided not to participate in the project under the present arrangement to dispel any misgivings over the government's commitment to transparency and good governance.""
YTL Power said it still welcomed an opportunity to take part in the project on a ""competitive"" basis.
YTL Power snagged the 1,000MW to 1,400MW power plant project in Pasir Gudang project with private Johor company SIPP Energy, and national power firm Tenaga Nasional last month. But Tenaga Nasional denied on Monday that it has joined the consortium.
The Johor power plant project came under intense media scrutiny in the past week following remarks at a forum earlier this month by Tan Sri Yeoh that seemed to deny that he benefited from direct awards of large government projects, including building Malaysia's first independent power plant during the tenure of Dr Mahathir as prime minister.
Mr Yeoh said, according to media reports, that 85 per cent of YTL's business is in Britain, Singapore and Australia because these countries do not tolerate corruption, practise meritocracy and stand for the rule of law.
""For example in Singapore, we own a third of Singapore's electricity, there is no subsidy of any kind, there is no cronyism of any type,"" he had said.
""The good thing about these three territories, I don't have to kowtow to the prime minister before I do deals, I don't have to see them even, even after I've won the deal. I turn west because of this transparent, coherent regulatory framework.""
Dr Mahathir wrote in his blog a week later: ""Recently a public figure claimed that the situation in Malaysia is terrible because of cronyism and favouritism in the form of discrimination towards one party. So he does not wish to do business here.
""Was he born so rich that he could do business in the countries free from cronyism or did he amass his copious capital here before moving abroad to enjoy governance without cronyism?""

","   A former Member of Parliament once related to me how, after he retired from politics, one of the first things he did was to buy himself a spanking new luxury car.
And he relished the moment he pointed out his car to the then prime minister, to make the point that his years of toeing the party line of maintaining a modest lifestyle in public were finally over.
His story came to mind when I heard Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong speak of keeping Singapore an open, egalitarian society where the rich do not flaunt their wealth but remain low-key and unassuming, and people are not judged by the cars they drive, brand of clothes they wear or the way they speak.
I am not sure if such a society would appeal to today's affluent Singaporeans. Or would they - like that retired MP I met - chafe at such restraints on their lifestyle choices?
Mr Lee has a point when he says social behaviour can impede social mobility, and make it more difficult and more unlikely for those who are less well-off to access opportunity.
The clearest example is schools.
Last month, Nominated MP Eugene Tan spoke passionately in Parliament about how the Raffles Institution of today has a far less diverse student body than in his time, an observation confirmed by the chairman of the school's board, Mr Choo Chiau Beng. My colleague Sandra Davie also reported that a scholarship scheme to draw more students from non-brand name primary schools to RI has worked with only a handful of boys.
One worry is that even when their PSLE results are strong enough, some children from poorer homes do not feel comfortable taking up places in Singapore's top secondary schools because they will be outnumbered by their wealthy peers.
A teacher in a non-elite secondary school summed up how children from the HDB heartland now think about schools like RI and Raffles Girls' School: ""Our kind don't go there.""
That may explain why there is now a conscious effort on the part of the Government to try to reshape the culture in schools, so that students from poorer homes will not be put off from studying in top schools ""because they feel left out, out of place or socially uncomfortable"", to quote PM Lee.
Addressing Parliament last month, he cited a new rule that from this year reserves at least 40 places in every primary school for children with no prior links, to ""prevent our schools from becoming closed institutions"".
He also touched on a more controversial area of change. He said: ""We are also exercising restraint in school spending and activities, sometimes having to restrain the schools and ask them not to go overboard in their enthusiasm. For example, raising funds to build infrastructure, which must not be lavish, or planning study trips to exotic and expensive destinations. It is not necessary to go to the other side of the world to learn about the world; there are many things you can learn just in our own neighbourhood.""
The protests from wealthy alumni and parents have been muted, but one young Singaporean summed up what some of them may be thinking when she asked me after Mr Lee's speech: ""Isn't that anti-meritocratic, an attempt to level down those at the top rather than pull up those at the bottom?""
I find her candour revealing, for it shows how the competitive meritocracy we have had in place for decades has shaped how we as a society think about performance, excellence and reward.
For the most part, Singaporeans who have succeeded worked hard and smart to get to where they are today. They also live in a meritocracy which has to date stressed that the talented deserve to be richly rewarded for their efforts.
And the People's Action Party Government's policies in a whole range of areas, from schools to incomes to ministerial pay to foreign talent, enabled and encouraged such thinking. But those policies belong to a different era in which free-market capitalism reigned supreme.
Now, it is time to change and to correct the weaknesses of the winner-take-all meritocracy of years past, but even if the Government is ready to move quickly on policy, people's values and norms will take far longer to change.
And there will be strong resistance from those who have planned their lives and their children's future on the basis of the old rules.
But if we as a society are agreed that growing income inequality and slowing social mobility are big problems that we need to tackle head on, we must also be ready to change even where it entails sacrifice on our part.
A key question is how best to bring about this cultural shift.
It will probably be faster and easier to enforce new norms through government fiat, but change enforced from above tends to breed resentment and drive people to seek ways to circumvent what they see as unjust restrictions.
A slower, more sustainable way to reshape culture is through persuasion and education, by showing people that there is a different way to view success and the good life beyond branded clothes, fancy cars and big houses. That way, the rich themselves will want to change and rethink how they spend their time and money.
We need to celebrate the choices of people who have gone ahead to redefine the good life in terms beyond the material, and found happiness in serving others.
Marine Parade GRC MP Seah Kian Peng recently held up one such Singaporean as an example: Dr Tan Lai Yong, a medical doctor who spent 15 years in China's Yunnan province caring for the poor. He and his family returned to Singapore in 2010 because after he received an award from then-Premier Wen Jiabao, the Chinese started treating him like a VIP.
He is now a senior lecturer at a National University of Singapore residential college, where he teaches a course that helps undergraduates better understand the plight of hidden communities, such as the elderly who live alone, former convicts and migrant workers.
Not all of us are called to such a spartan life but one form of service that many of us can perform is to close the gap between ourselves and those who are less well-off, by thinking hard about how best to put them at ease.

","   I CANNOT agree more with political editor Lydia Lim on the need to change our social and cultural values so that we can limit the adverse effect of meritocracy turning Singapore into a winner-take-all society (""Long-term task to fix winner-take-all mindset""; Sunday).
We need meritocracy to spur success. It was the economic model since our nation's independence 49 years ago.
But to evolve into a winner-take-all society is utterly bad for national unity.
It leads to a divisive population and reduces trust in government.
It is one in which there is superior financial advantage for those at the top but if you are second or further down the hierarchy, you get nothing comparable, however good.
Having benefited from meritocracy, I was enlightened by Occupy Wall Street - the protest movement in New York that brought to light some of the social ills of unabated American capitalism, such as the widening income gap and stunted social mobility.
Singapore's Gini coefficient - a measure of income inequality - is among the highest in the world, so there is every cause for concern.
While we should not stoke class resentments, rational dialogue among the top-echelon citizens should begin sooner rather than later. More data and research are needed so that discussions can be more productive - beyond rhetoric.
When convinced, I believe more affluent Singaporeans are prepared to make adjustments for a more equitable society.
We can explore how to further improve our economic mechanisms to distribute wealth more fairly.

","   SINCE when has Singapore ever been a winner-take-all society (""Engage now for a more equitable society"" by Dr Edmund Lam; last Saturday)?
Even well before the recent shift to ""left of centre"", Singapore's brand of capitalism was far more benign than the United States' or even Hong Kong's version.
The HDB provided roofs over most Singaporeans' heads, with mortgage payments pegged at sustainable portions of their monthly incomes.
Schools provided virtually free education. No pupil was denied the education he deserved because of financial difficulties, and the ablest from the humblest backgrounds got to study at Oxbridge on the state's account.
No one was left dying in the street because he had no insurance, and no government hospital delayed an urgent costly operation because of doubts over the patient's ability to pay.
Have winners now taken all in Singapore?
If that had happened, newly married couples would not be buying HDB flats (and making a profit five years later), but renting from winners-turned-landlords for years on end.
Winners' children, instead of having to ace the Primary School Leaving Examination, would just be a donation cheque away from the secondary schools of their choice.
And winners would be treated in private hospitals that would have cornered the best doctors and equipment, condemning the rest to inferior public hospitals with third-rate doctors and outdated equipment.
The Government, while allowing meritocracy to create wealth, has not hesitated to transfer wealth from the successful to the less successful. Such transfers have been growing in recent years.
It is dangerous to focus on what the successful can have that the less successful cannot have, instead of what the less successful can have compared to any reasonable benchmark.
The bell curve naturally separates the successful from the rest, so the only way to give similar rewards to both the successful and less successful is to level down the former, but this will not help the latter.
For us to stay together as a community, wealth transfer from the successful to the less successful is essential.
But instead of targeting some pre-determined income gap or Gini coefficient, such transfers must aim at ensuring that the least successful among us live healthy, productive and dignified lives based on a reasonable benchmark, with opportunities for advancement open to them if they apply themselves to the fullest.
A fair and just society is not one in which no one can live better than his neighbour. Such social resentment, which some commentators appear to be encouraging, will bring Singapore to its knees.

","   A KEY member of Singapore's fourth-generation leadership has set out what he sees as the country's challenges over the next decade and beyond, and proposed strategies for staying competitive, relevant and united.
Social and Family Development Minister Chan Chun Sing was addressing members of the Economic Society of Singapore at their annual dinner, days before Singapore, whose existence as a small, independent nation he said he never takes for granted, celebrates its 49th National Day.
He kicked off his speech with a survey of geopolitics, where one uncertainty comes from United States-China ties.
For a small country like Singapore, another challenge is how to stay relevant as its larger neighbours reach milestones: Indonesia on the threshold of middle-class status, and Malaysia seeking to break into the ranks of developed countries.
""The challenge for Singapore is to develop a constructive and complementary relationship with our closest and fast-growing neighbours. Our risk is that if we are unable to create value and lose our strategic weight, we can be easily marginalised and relegated to irrelevance - where others dictate what we do and not do.""
Singapore must also learn to adapt to rising volatility due to disruptive technologies. Here, he highlighted as a key concern the displacement of middle-income jobs, which could accentuate inequality and fracture society.
Stating his stand on a much-debated issue among economists on the right scale of transfers between rich and poor, Mr Chan said: ""Our real and greater challenge is to strengthen the ability of our middle-income earners to compete on the global stage, rather than only arguing about the scale of transfers.""
The key principles behind Singapore's established approach to social transfers to the needy will remain unchanged, he added.
These are to provide targeted rather than universal help so that those with the least get the most help, and to keep spending sustainable - so as not to transfer the burden to future generations, ensure continued support from society's most productive members, and avoid running down the national reserves so they can remain a buffer against the vagaries of intensifying economic cycles.
Mr Chan also offered four strategies for Singapore to prepare for significant social, political and economic shifts.
First, even as Singaporeans ""scale the mountains of the world"", they must remain rooted to home and want to give back to the country. Second, Singapore ""must continue to turn constraints into opportunities"". Third, it should leverage the faith others have in its standards and laws. Finally, it must stay cohesive, adaptable and resilient, with ""the right social compact and values"", and good leadership with the four Cs of being ""committed, capable, connected and clean"".
On social mobility, he defended Singapore's meritocracy, saying there is ""nothing intrinsically wrong"" with a system that rewards talent and effort, rather than kinship ties and inheritance.
""We can never equalise inheritance or endowment. But we can endeavour to allow our people to have the best opportunities to realise their talents and blessings,"" he said. ""We must continue to push hard for continuous meritocracy. That one's fate and achievement is not pre-ordained by one's initial endowment, or any single achievement in life, but shaped more by one's talent and continuous efforts.""

",NA,"   AS PRESIDENT of a newly-independent Singapore, Mr Yusof Ishak went down to the ground to reassure citizens stunned by their sudden ejection from Malaysia, rallying them to forge an inclusive multiracial society as part of their new national identity.
He visited constituencies all over the island, standing upright in an open Land Rover, walking for hours in the hot sun.
""He was a president for all Singaporeans,"" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told the National Day Rally. ""Encik Yusof showed that in Singapore, you can rise to the top if you work hard. He stood for enduring values that underpinned Singapore's success: meritocracy, multiracialism, modernisation.""
Born in Perak in 1910, Mr Yusof was the oldest of nine children of a civil servant. He attended Victoria Bridge School before entering Raffles Institution, where he was one of 13 students - and the only Malay - in the Queen's Scholarship class.
He did not win the scholarship, but got a taste of politics as his father was an active member of the Singapore Malay Union, where Mr Yusof would later become a youth leader.
At 29, he started Utusan Melayu, a newspaper dedicated to Malay issues, and which championed the need for the community to modernise and focus on education.
Even as he gave the community a voice, he spent his years as head of state stressing the need for racial harmony and multiculturalism for Singapore to succeed, right up to his death from heart failure in office in 1970.
Said Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim this month: ""It was his firm belief in respect and multiracialism that held the nation together in our early years, and it was his drive in championing a progressive Malay/Muslim community that rallied our people together.""
Mr Yusof said in his 1968 New Year message: ""No man need feel that to belong to a particular religion puts him at a disadvantage or gives him an advantage... This is how things are in Singapore and this is how things must always be in our country. Only in this way can a multiracial society like Singapore live in peace and prosperity.""

","   THE new Yusof Ishak Mosque in Woodlands will embody the same values that the former president often stressed: racial harmony and multi-culturalism.
Besides serving as a place of worship for the Muslim community, it will also hold programmes that reach out to other communities and enhance understanding and social cohesion.
The proposed design of the mosque in Woodlands Drive 17 was unveiled at a roadshow yesterday at the An-Nur Mosque in Admiralty Road, after its name was first revealed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the National Day Rally on Sunday.
Describing Singapore's first head of state as an outstanding member of the pioneer generation, PM Lee said Mr Yusof had been a president for all Singaporeans and stood for enduring values that underpinned Singapore's success: meritocracy, multiracialism and modernisation.
At yesterday's event, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim said the mosque will work to carry on this legacy.
""The primary function of a mosque is obviously to serve the needs of a religious community, in this case the Malay-Muslim community. But having named the mosque after him, it's also important that we try and encourage as many programmes as possible to bring non-Muslims closer to the mosque. I'm sure he will want that to happen, because having his name there, it's almost a national institution,"" he added.
The design of the $15 million mosque, which sits on a 2,500 sq m site and has capacity for 4,200 worshippers, draws inspiration from Mr Yusof's official and private residences and will feature eaves, a verandah and balustrades that are distinctive of a tropical Malay house. It will also have a pitch roof instead of grand domes, an auditorium, a cafe and an IT corner.
Mufti Mohamed Fatris Bakaram, Singapore's highest Islamic authority, added that he hopes the mosque will instil the values that the former president held dear: piousness, community spirit, and the motivation to do better.
""(These are) values significant in the life of Yusof Ishak that need to be developed further and instilled in the hearts and minds of the next generation,"" he said.
Together with the 4,500-capacity Maarof Mosque in Jurong West that was announced in June, the Yusof Ishak Mosque will ease overcrowding at the An-Nur Mosque, which is currently the only mosque serving Woodlands and Marsiling. Both new mosques are expected be ready in 2016.
Woodlands resident Mohammad Hisham Hairi, 46, said the Yusof Ishak Mosque will be more convenient for him to worship at because it will be closer to home.
The taxi driver, who has lived for 14 years in the area, now alternates between An-Nur and mosques in Sembawang, which he said are packed at peak timings.
""I'm sure more Woodlands residents will go (to the Yusof Ishak Mosque) instead of Sembawang or Marsiling, so there will be less spillover,"" he said. ""It's nice that we've got another place for us to pray and get near to Allah.""

","   WHEN Japanese planes flew over Singapore on Dec 8, 1941, in the first bombing raid of World War II, most of the nation screeched to a halt.
Families huddled in bomb shelters. Offices emptied. But in a dingy three-storey building in Queen Street, 31-year-old Yusof Ishak, managing director of Utusan Melayu, ignored the air raid sirens, kept his reporters at their desks and posted a lookout on the roof.
Only when the lookout saw planes approaching, would the newspaper's staff be allowed to dash for the nearby bomb shelters. This continued as air-raids battered Singapore for the next two months, killing almost 9,000 civilians.
Even in war, Mr Yusof was determined that the newspaper he had co-founded - his platform to nurture an educated and progressive Malay community - would be printed on schedule.
So, as the bombs fell around him, the man who would become Singapore's first President stood his ground. Later, as he helped steer Singapore through the tumultuous years that spanned self-government, merger, separation and, eventually, independence, he displayed that same focus, this time to help citizens build a common national identity.
Former minister Othman Wok, once a Utusan Melayu reporter, said: ""He was always focused in everything he did. He'd do things quietly, diligently. That was the man he was. And that was the man Singapore needed then.""
His years as head of state, from 1959 to 1970, roiled with racial tension. There were times when the Malay community eyed the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) with suspicion.
The PAP had in 1959 put itself forward as a party that believed in merger with Malaysia - which Malays, by extension, saw as a sign of support for the community. After separation in 1965, some felt betrayed.
But Mr Yusof walked for hours in the sun, visiting constituents and soothing their fears. He worked with the Government to ensure that Malays had the education and health care they needed, to prove they were not discriminated against.
""It was people like Yusof Ishak who gave people the comfort that the Government had not forgotten about the Malays,"" said Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed, a former senior minister of state who was classmates with Mr Yusof's son, Imran.
""He was one of those who made the decision to stay with Singapore, to work and make a success of the country and values he believed in. Of course, it took longer than his lifetime, but those early years were important,"" Mr Zainul added.
Among the values Mr Yusof espoused were meritocracy and multiracialism, topics he had written on as a young journalist.
The eldest of nine children, he was born in Perak in 1910. His father, Mr Ishak Ahmad, was a civil servant whose family moved here with him when he was transferred to Singapore to be Inspector of Fisheries.
Mr Yusof studied at Raffles Institution, where he was co-editor of the Rafflesian - the start of a lifelong love affair with newspapers.
At age 29, he co-founded the Utusan Melayu newspaper. He went from kampung to kampung, hawking shares to raise money to set it up. His mother and sisters pawned their jewellery in support.
In Utusan's early days, he slept in the printing room, guarding the printing presses which he feared would be stolen.
The first issue went to print on May 29, 1939, and sold a few hundred copies. By 1957, the paper had a circulation of 40,000.
Mr Yusof ruled the newsroom with an iron fist.
""He knew what he wanted and he'd work towards it. He didn't want things done by halves. So when he gave you an assignment, you had to carry it out, by hook or by crook,"" Mr Othman recalled.
Once, thinking that Mr Othman had failed to do his job, Mr Yusof fired him. ""He told me, 'Get out, I don't want to see your face anymore!' "" But when the misunderstanding was cleared up 20 minutes later, the young reporter was rehired.
But in 1959, Mr Yusof left the paper and moved back to Perak.
Utusan Melayu had been critical of the United Malays National Organisation (Umno) - which believed in special privileges for the Malays, a concept Mr Yusof had railed against - but from 1955, Umno members began buying up a bulk of the paper's shares.
""Mr Yusof couldn't see eye to eye with the new board of directors. One day, he had enough,"" said Mr Othman.
That was when Mr Lee Kuan Yew, then Singapore's Prime Minister, came calling.
""He asked me, 'Where is Cik Yusof?' I told him, 'He lives in Malaysia now and grows and sells orchids.' Mr Lee asked me, 'That's what he does?' "" Mr Othman said.
A month after that, Mr Yusof was back in Singapore and became chairman of the Public Service Commission in July 1959.
Later that year, Mr Lee would again seek Mr Othman's opinion.
""He told me: 'We need a head of state. Do you think Cik Yusof fits the bill?' "" said Mr Othman.
""I said, 'Of course! He has very close relations with the people, Malays and non-Malays. He mixes very well with them. He's been walking the ground as a journalist, so he knows what the situation is. He's the right person for the job!' ""
In December 1959, Mr Yusof was appointed Singapore's Yang di-Pertuan Negara. He was to die in office of heart failure in 1970 at age 60.
For a man who would become the face of the Singapore dollar, Mr Yusof was exceedingly thrifty. In his years at Utusan Melayu, he drove an old car that had to be pushed to start.
One of his few indulgences was orchids. It was a costly hobby, so his wife, Madam Noor Aishah, took it upon herself to sew his clothes instead of buying them.
The pair wed in 1948, in an arranged marriage. She was 16 and from Penang. They would have three children - one a daughter named Orkid.
Her husband, said Madam Noor Aishah, had a fondness for loud Hawaiian shirts, a contrast to his severe demeanour.
""If you looked at him, he seemed serious and intimidating, but behind it all, he was very friendly. He really loved people,"" said the 81-year-old. ""When he was with friends and family, there was always laughter.""
When he became head of state, he chose not to live in the Istana, living instead in a secretarial bungalow on the grounds.
Mr Yusof disliked protocol, said Mr Othman, now 90.
""One day, he told me, 'Othman, why don't you move into the grounds? So I stayed in a small house there for some years. When he got lonely, he'd just come walking over. We'd sit down, talk, drink some tea. That's all he ever wanted. He liked to be around people. He liked being an ordinary person.""
Above all, Mr Yusof wanted to see the success of the Malay community - and of the new nation. Madam Noor Aishah said her late husband was concerned about the country after separation.
He wanted to see the citizens work harder, and educate themselves, she said.
During his Utusan Melayu years, he had urged Malays to improve themselves, and not claim lack of opportunities as an excuse for not doing better.
""Blaming the other races does not help in any way to uplift the status of the Malays within the country,"" Mr Yusof wrote in an editorial.
Last Sunday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that to mark Singapore's 50th year of independence, the nation would honour Mr Yusof by naming a mosque, a think-tank and a professorship after him.
Mr Lee also spoke about the Malay community's progress, something Mr Othman is sure his old friend would be proud of. ""He wanted us to survive, and he wanted us to do it by ourselves, with no special rights or privileges. If he were alive, he'd be very happy to see the Malay community standing on its feet, and to see how Singapore is now.""

","   DR GILLIAN Koh's commentary (""Making vocational ladder on par with the academic""; last Wednesday) provides a good insight into Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech.
Singapore has been a meritocracy for years, and academic qualifications have always been viewed as a ""passport"" to getting a good job.
Sadly, this puts non-degree holders at a disadvantage and causes them to be ""short-changed"" in their career advancement.
I chose the polytechnic route after my O levels even though my grades were good enough for entry to a top junior college, as a vocational education with more hands-on learning fit my personality better. However, I was unable to further my studies at a university because of family and financial commitments.
Not having a degree has disadvantaged me in many ways.
I worked in the civil service for more than five years. During this period, I was deprived of opportunities for career advancement even though my performance appraisals were above average. The reason given was that I was only a diploma holder.
My attempts to get a company sponsorship for further studies were also turned down.
I agree that it is difficult to attain perfect parity between the vocational and academic tracks, as local employers are still very concerned about academic qualifications and grades.
I also agree with Dr Koh that the ability to integrate talent from all backgrounds - vocational, academic, degree holders and non-degree holders - would bring about better talent management in Singapore.
During my 15 years in the workforce, I have seen many talented polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) graduates who were on a par with degree holders.
Indeed, PM Lee's Rally speech, where he mentioned that non-graduates will be offered more career opportunities in the public service (""Better job prospects for non-grads""; Aug 18), echoed my sentiments.
I hope that with this ""culture shift"", employers will assess staff based on their job performance and abilities, and not solely on paper qualifications. Employers should also provide more opportunities for diploma holders and ITE graduates to further their studies.

","   ONE of the unfortunate realities of economic discourse in Singapore is that outside the Government, there is relatively little research on practical public policy, especially social policy.
So the publication of the book, Hard Choices: Challenging The Singapore Consensus, featuring the views of scholars who do not serve in Government comes as a breath of fresh air - even more so for the fact that, as its sub-title suggests, it questions some long-held assumptions and dogmas, some of which have been baked into policy for decades.
Policymakers, academics and members of the public have come to accept as axiomatic certain policy ends and means - what the book's authors describe as ""the Singapore consensus"". For example, it is more or less taken for granted that economic growth is always good, universal government-funded welfare schemes are generally bad, meritocracy is an unmitigated plus, an ageing population portends serious problems and home ownership is good for everyone.
The authors of Hard Choices seem to believe that these axioms are open to question, or at least qualification.
The book consists of a series of essays, which have been published before separately, but which pack a powerful intellectual punch when put together in a volume. The essays are organised along different themes, though these sometimes overlap.
Inequality and wages
THE issue of inequality is one major theme that runs through the book. Unfashionable in economics until recently - governments were focused more on economic growth than income distribution - inequality now takes centre stage in economic debate. The global financial crisis was a watershed that exposed the dimensions of the problem; Singapore, too, has suffered from rising inequality since the 1990s.
Donald Low's fine essay, The Four Myths Of Inequality In Singapore, addresses some of the common misconceptions about inequality. He argues persuasively that it is not an inevitable consequence of growth and dynamism; the evidence shows that unequal societies do not produce superior economic outcomes.
Nor is helping the rich the best way to help the poor; in Singapore, the introduction of a less progressive tax system since the 1990s has increased inequality, which has not been sufficiently offset by redistributive policies in the form of Workfare and discretionary fiscal transfers, which Mr Low suggests have ""simply not been aggressive enough"". He makes a strong case for reinforcing them.
However on the regressive tax policies, the situation is not simple. Singapore needs to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) - much more so, relative to economic size than the high-tax economies of northern Europe, which are often cited in this book. While Singapore has many non-tax advantages relative to other countries, it cannot allow its tax rates to get too far out of line.
Since the 1990s, several economies, including Singapore's competitors, have been reducing their tax rates. Could Singapore have held the line with a top marginal tax rate of say, 30 per cent, when Hong Kong was at 15 per cent and Ireland, 12 per cent? Would it still have been able to attract the sort of FDI that it did? And if it did not, what would have happened to growth and jobs? Would lower-income Singaporeans have been better off? This seems unlikely. Mr Low rightly points out that people care more about their incomes relative to others than about their absolute levels of income. He notes that income inequality also leads to inequality of opportunity, which then perpetuates the problem: the children of the rich generally get a better education than the children of the poor, which carries inequality into the next generation.
He also contests the view that unequal pay is purely the result of unequal ability. He points out that wages are not only a function of productivity, but also of immigration. Thus he recommends that ""to raise the wages of our lower-skilled workers, the emphasis should NOT (his emphasis) be on raising their productivity, but on reducing our intake of low-skilled foreign workers.""
Certainly, reducing this intake will lead to higher wages, especially given that Singapore has near-full employment. But it is not sustainable for wage levels to keep rising without a rise in productivity; companies hiring such workers will sooner or later simply go out of business. Nor should wages be allowed to shoot up sharply and suddenly by, for instance, draconian curbs on labour imports. Companies need time to adjust and productivity increases are typically slow.
Nor can Singapore adopt a one-size-fits-all policy towards labour imports. It is well known that in certain sectors, foreign workers are indispensable, at least in the short term. Construction is one. The marine sector is arguably another. Household help is definitely a third. Singapore could stop the intake of foreign maids, which would lead to the development of a local household-help sector, with wages perhaps five times higher than they are now. But how popular would this be, especially with families where women work?
The constant refrain throughout the book about the need to curb labour imports contains no caveats or a sense of calibration. Nor does it even mention the challenges Singapore will face when other social needs have to be addressed in labour intensive areas such as eldercare, where local professionals are in short supply. If Singapore is to curb labour imports in this industry too, it will need to find alternatives - and fast.
Immigration
IMMIGRATION is another hot-button issue tackled in this book. In his essay The End of Identity, Sudhir Thomas Vadaketh examines the impact of immigration on the Singaporean identity - or at least, his definition of it.
""Diversity must be celebrated,"" he writes, but ""it would be callous to ignore the impact of immigration on feelings of identity and belonging"".
Alas, there is little celebration of diversity in this essay. Quite the reverse, the impact of immigration, it would seem, has been unremittingly negative.
Some of his arguments are more polemical than analytical or even factual. For example, echoing a lot of Internet chatter, he cites ""many stories"", ""one common anecdote"" and ""countless accusations"" to assert that immigrants have ""torpedoed Singapore's meritocracy"", for example, by recruiting friends from back home rather than qualified Singaporeans, or by employers giving preference to foreigners over locals. No evidence is cited for these claims, which human resource professionals, at least, will tell you are baseless. Many companies are, in fact, having a tough time hiring per se.
In passing, Mr Vadaketh takes a rather unkind dig at the China-born Singaporean Olympic and Commonwealth Games medal-winning table tennis player Feng Tianwei, who ""to the bewilderment of her fellow citizens, has not bothered to learn English, despite having lived in Singapore for five years"". In her defence, she does speak Chinese, which is one of Singapore's official languages. It is not as if she speaks only, say, Swahili. Besides, one wonders what Mr Vadaketh makes of his many Singapore-born, non-bilingual Chinese, Malay and Tamil-speaking fellow citizens.
Sadly, the essay has nothing to say about how Singapore has gained from immigrants - for example from new entrepreneurs, ideas and skills in areas ranging from technology to finance to education, which have enabled many companies to grow, to the benefit of Singaporeans as well, and from advances in R&D and innovation, where foreigners work with Singaporeans in agencies such as the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star).
Nor a word of appreciation for the thousands of foreign construction workers who have helped to physically build so much of modern Singapore, or the foreign medical staff who have cared for the sick, or the foreign maids who have taken some of the burden off working families and helped raise generations of children.
Nor indeed is there any appreciation of the greater diversity and richness in the artistic, cultural and culinary scene, as manifested, for example in the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, many of whose talented musicians are of foreign origin; there is also no mention of the foreign-born chefs and restaurateurs here, which has created the greatest variety of international cuisines in Asia. All of the above contribute to the quality of life, but this is not acknowledged. It has become unfashionable, and even politically incorrect, to speak of such things.
What is fashionable to speak of is the angst that immigration has created and which is the main focus of Mr Vadaketh's essay. He complains that foreigners have disrupted the traditional Chinese-Indian-Malay composition of Singapore; whether this is actually true or not, the perception must be acknowledged.
But as he would know, every country with a history of immigration has gone through changes in its social make-up. At the turn of the last century, existing settlers in America complained about Irish and Italian immigrants. These days, there are complaints about Spanish-speaking newcomers from immigrants who came earlier. Changes have occurred in Britain, Europe and Australia as well. Eventually, people adapt to social change and some, at least, grow to welcome the diversity, including in Singapore. As the US national immigration forum has pointed out, ""every new wave of immigrants has been met with suspicion and doubt and yet, ultimately, every past wave of immigrants has been vindicated and saluted"".
This has been true of Singapore as well. Its society has hardly been static; since the last century, successive waves of immigrants from different places kept changing the ethnic and social make-up and added to the richness of the society, in every sense. So while one can sympathise with Mr Vadaketh's nostalgia for one specific social configuration, it is a poor argument to clamp down on immigration.
It also does not sit well with his later point - an insightful one - that the ""fragile, embryonic Singaporean identity"" is evolving. He notes that Singapore is in the middle of a transition from a highly rooted ""national identity"" to a less-rooted ""global city"" identity, the latter being the identity that many migrants embrace. Increasingly, Singaporeans too are going the same way, becoming more cosmopolitan and global in tastes, outlook and world view.
Thus, after all his complaints about immigrants, Mr Vadaketh is able to end on a positive note, suggesting that ""Singapore has unwittingly created a model for a future where nationhood, ethnicity and religion should not matter"". ""Each must be celebrated but remain secondary to the higher human identity.""
And he points out, correctly, one of the great strengths of Singaporeans is that ""they can find common ground with more people than any other nationality"". It is hoped they will be able to do this at home as well.
The impact of immigration on the job market has attracted a lot of attention. One oft-cited observation, repeated several times in this book, is that low-cost foreign workers have allowed businesses to keep Singaporeans' wages lower than they otherwise would be.
This is probably true, but it is also too simple - a macroeconomist should look at the bigger picture. As Professor Ng Yew Kwang, Winsemius Professor of Economics at the Nanyang Technological University, has pointed out, while foreign workers can have the effect of depressing wages at the low end, they also contribute to the more efficient use of resources such as land and capital.
The classic example once cited by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, about a factory that operates a day shift and a night shift. Singaporeans work the day shift and foreigners, the night shift. If you remove the foreigners, the factory becomes less efficient and maybe even unviable. In this particular example, the day-shift Singaporean workers benefit from the presence of the night-shift foreign workers. The whole factory benefits, and so does the economy.
The point is, you have to look at not just wages but also efficiency. The more productive use of land and capital because of the presence of foreign workers is a positive effect that must be weighed against the negative effect of lower wages. Even if the negative effect dominates and inequality rises, it is arguably better to resolve the issue through fiscal transfers rather than attacking efficiency by removing foreign workers.
On what happens at the top end of the workforce, Mr Vadaketh launches another polemical broadside, citing ""the perception"" that ""the global elite has moved here with containers of cash in hunt of lower tax rates and is creaming off the spoils of Singapore's growth"". It is not clear who he is talking about. Fund managers? Entrepreneurs? Billionaires? Nor is it clear how they are doing this skimming.
In her essay, Linda Lim takes the more reasoned view that at the upper end of the labour market, the presence of foreign workers reflects the fact that high-skilled jobs in many areas actively promoted by the government, such as high-tech electronics, petrochemicals, financial services and digital media, require specific skills that cannot be met locally. She proposes reducing the state's ""micromanagement of investment allocation"". But she does not say which sectors she would like see de-emphasised, which would be a tough call.
She also proposes revamping the education system by placing less emphasis on grades and more on soft skills and multicultural versatility, which Singaporean graduates allegedly lack and employers increasingly require. The Government is trying to do this, for example, by de-emphasising grades relative to skills, but Dr Lim has a point and there is surely scope to do more.
Social safety nets
IN THEIR essay on social safety nets, Donald Low and Yeoh Lam Keong bravely challenge the Singapore establishment's consensus view that social benefits be targeted at the needy, and make a case for northern Europe-style universal programmes that benefit the large majority of the population. They cite studies arguing that universal programmes foster greater social trust, because they lead to less inequality and greater social cohesion.
They acknowledge that these programmes are more expensive, but suggest that policymakers ""weigh their costs against their benefits"".
However, while the benefits are elaborated on, the costs are not. They are likely to be substantial and would almost certainly entail draconian increases in taxes. Since northern Europe is cited as a model, it bears noting that top income tax rates range from 48 per cent in Norway to 57 per cent in Sweden. The middle classes, too, pay direct taxes, unlike in Singapore, where some 70 per cent of the population does not.
Indirect taxes would probably need to go up sharply as well. In Scandinavian countries, VAT (value-added tax) rates are around 25 per cent. The people of Scandinavia accept this social contract of high taxes and high benefits.
Leaving aside whether Singaporeans would be willing to swallow such tax increases, even given the unquestioned benefits of universal programmes, there is also the issue of tax competitiveness. This is much less of an issue for northern European countries, which do not need to compete for foreign investment to the extent that Singapore does.
However, the authors do have a point when they say: ""The critical question to ask is not how we can keep social spending on a tight leash, but what kinds of social spending would deliver the greatest social benefits.""
It is worth translating this proposition to some policy action. While a universal programme of social spending would probably require punitive levels of taxation, Singapore can afford ""selective"" universality.
In particular, it could provide universal free education from kindergarten all the way through to a first university degree for all Singaporeans. Education is the ultimate ticket to social mobility. And as there are already subsidies being provided, albeit the regime being riddled with complicated qualifying criteria, the cost of extending these on a universal basis without exception would not be prohibitive. This would achieve at least some of the worthy social goals the authors seek.
On the issue of ageing, Mr Low's preference for zero population growth and his hardline view against immigration, dismissed as something ""Singaporeans will not accept"", leaves him with little choice but to propose that the way to deal with ageing is simply to adapt to it rather than try to mitigate it.
How? He advocates a ""slower growth model"" which relies largely, if not entirely, on productivity growth. He also calls for reforming the Central Provident Fund system and health and long-term care financing system. There is an assumption here that slower growth will somehow be accompanied by higher productivity, which is heroic and not borne out by recent experience. The costs of a higher dependency ratio and the implications for taxation, which will be considerable, also call for elaboration.
The assumption that population growth is not an option is questionable as well. Mr Low suggests that ""even if our physical carrying capacity is not yet near its maximum limit, society's absorptive capacity is probably nearing a critical threshold"".
He is probably right for now, although the Government, which has been on the defensive on this issue since the 2013 population White Paper, has not pressed the case for population growth. A case can be made, if Singapore's population is more spatially distributed and its infrastructure substantially enhanced - both of which are in process.
As Mr Low correctly points out, quoting behavioural economists, our assumptions about the future are often anchored in the present; ""citizens' perceptions of quality of life in the future were... influenced by their current lived experience of congestion and crowdedness"". He adds that ""anchoring in the present"" can be a mistake when projecting into the future.
He could take his own advice; attitudes to immigration, too, can change. As the research of Professor Benjamin Friedman of Harvard University found, such attitudes typically wax and wane over time, depending on economic conditions. Anti-immigrant sentiment has never been permanent in any society with a history of immigration, it remains to be seen how long it will last here.
There are many other issues in this book that this review has not tackled, such as housing, politics and governance, where, too, the authors call for reform.
Some of these ideas will be considered iconoclastic. But that is one of the merits of this book, which, whether you agree with it or not, is arguably the most stimulating and provocative ever written on public policy in Singapore. It deserves the wide readership it has received.

The issue of inequality is one major theme that runs through the book. Unfashionable in economics until recently - governments were focused more on economic growth than income distribution - inequality now takes centre stage in economic debate.

"," Cultural change
","   Years ago, my mother used to nag her three children, saying: ""If you don't study hard, you'll end up a road sweeper.""
Sometimes, one of us would retort cheekily: ""If everyone thinks like you, who will sweep the roads in Singapore?""
I don't mind swimming or cycling in the sun, but not sweeping floors. I studied hard.
My late parents were uneducated, ordinary folk from China who came to Singapore decades ago in search of a better life. They believed that their hard work was so that their children could go to school, study hard, and work in an office - not toil in the sun as their peasant forebears did.
At the heart of my mother's simple axiom - study hard or sweep floors - is a simple world view that splits the world into two groups: that of the thinker-scholar-manager and the worker-doer-sweeper.
It springs from centuries of Chinese civilisation. Ancient Chinese society is often described as falling into four classes: the shi (the scholar or administrative class, which had roots in warrior orders), the nong (farmers), the gong (artisans and craftsmen) and the shang (merchants).
When my mother nagged us to study, she was articulating her aspiration for her children to move from the nong to the shi class, not slide down to the gong.
In those words reside centuries of Chinese parental expectation. I suspect it does not differ much today.
It will thus be no easy task for the Aspire committee and the Government to try to reprogramme the Singapore population and get people to believe that one does not need a university degree to succeed in Singapore, and that those who embark on the gong (artisanal) path stand as good a chance as the shi (scholar) to succeed.
Aspire stands for Applied Study in Polytechnics and ITE Review, and is a committee tasked to look at ""how to strengthen the applied education pathway"" in polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), to ensure that graduates from these institutes have ""good career and academic progression prospects"".
Aspire released its report last Monday. One of its recommendations is to strengthen work-study programmes, so polytechnic and ITE graduates can continue to upgrade their skills after they start work.
At his National Day Rally, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also called for a ""cultural change"" in values. His message to young people: ""Do not go on a paper chase for qualifications or degrees, especially if they are not relevant, because pathways and opportunities to upgrade and to get better qualifications will remain open throughout your career.
""It is never the last chance.
""You always have the possibility to advance, to improve yourself, to take another step as long as you are working, as long as your mind remains fresh and active and you dare to go.""
Since then, public discussion on the issue has been heated. Some wonder if a degree is now useless. Others wonder if the ""cultural change"" is meant to reduce demand for university places from young Singaporeans, for fear the economy will not be able to offer them good-enough jobs.
I think the message is a different one. A degree is useful. In fact, it is going to be more, not less so, as more young people start off working life with one.
Rather, the message is: Don't rush straight from school to a degree. Don't get just any degree. Don't bankrupt yourself or your parents to get a degree from overseas. Take time to work, discover your true skill and passion, and climb the ladder of work mastery. There will be chances along the way to get a degree if you want it.
The PM's words bear repeating: ""There is never a last chance.""
This, to me, is a crucial message. The doors are not closing. There is never a last chance for that paper.
At the heart of the cultural change that the PM is calling for is a ""continuous meritocracy"", in the words of Deputy PM Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who used the term at a university student forum in September 2012.
Singapore can't be an ""exam meritocracy"", where career prospects depend on how well one did in final-year exams at age 22.
It has to be a society where merit is constantly tested, and proven, and rewarded, and improved upon, in the workplace, over and over again.
To do this requires us as a society to rethink our world views, and stop using pure academic qualifications as the criteria for so many things: to get into educational institutions; to get into training programmes; to slot people into different career schemes at work; and even to sign up for match-making programmes.
Paper qualifications may influence starting pay, but should not restrict a person's progression for the rest of his career.
Entry to training and skills courses especially can't be closed off to those who failed school exams. Otherwise, we condemn large numbers of people to low-skill, low-pay jobs for life, and never make use of their full potential.
It's quite clear from the PM's Rally speech that he's not saying a degree is of less value. The people he cited in his speech, who did well in their careers without degrees, were people who continued to learn and get qualified while on the job.
One started with a poly diploma and went on to complete an executive master's degree in business administration from the Singapore Management University. Another, who went to ITE, is pursuing a part-time polytechnic diploma. One man who dropped out of Secondary 2, went on to get a National Technical Certificate-3, awarded by ITE.
When The Straits Times published on its front page stories of two people who had succeeded without degrees, it was a similar story: a diploma-holder who worked as a sommelier for a few years and then got a degree; and a technician with a diploma now taking night classes towards - yes, a degree.
Persuading young people to work first, then pursue advanced qualifications in their chosen field, requires a huge change in the workplace. It needs employers who are fully engaged in helping workers get those higher-level skills and qualifications. The Aspire report made a start, but it will require many more committees and much more reorganising to get things moving.
Employers are as critical in this cultural change as parents and students.
Workers will believe there's never a last chance for a degree if employers are able to say: Come work for me and you will have chances to progress in skills, in paper qualifications, and in pay.

",NA,"   Singapore is changing.
You have heard this line many times by now, so what's new?
Well, here's one more to add to the fast-changing story line: You don't need a university degree to succeed.
Good luck to that one! You can almost hear the cynics saying.
It will be a tough sell even after the Prime Minister devoted a large part of his National Day Rally to the issue, recounting several examples of Singaporeans who have done well without a university education.
""We need a cultural change because, fundamentally, this is about our values, about how we value people, and Singapore must always be a place where everyone can feel proud of what they do, where you are respected for your contributions and your character, and anyone can improve his life if he works hard and everyone can hope for a better future,"" he said.
Put this way, it's a lot to ask, almost requiring the PM to move heaven and earth to make it happen.
To understand what it will take to make this transformation, you have to first know what the present condition is like.
In fact, the issue is more than just about whether a university degree is useful for everyone and will get you ahead in life.
It is about the more deeply entrenched view of how Singapore regards talent and the role of the elite here.
It's a pity the PM didn't spend more time on this because I believe he would have made a greater impact if he did.
So what is the prevailing narrative?
At its core, it is that Singapore is a little red dot with no natural resources and so has to depend solely on its people to earn its keep.
And the most important group is those at the top, in leadership positions, because the decisions they make matter the most to the country's survival and success.
Therefore every effort must be made to identify, nurture and develop them.
They have innate intelligence and drive, and given the right conditions and support, will make their abilities count.
A university education is a basic requisite, but not just any degree as only the very best of the Oxbridge or Ivy League kind will do.
It was a powerful narrative that shaped the way Singapore educated and selected those earmarked for these positions.
Generous government scholarships were granted to the select few with stellar academic achievements.
Local institutions like the National University of Singapore were not considered good or prestigious enough even as their global rankings rose.
The elite Administrative Service was where most of these scholars ended up, and its pay scale reflected their pedigree standing, pegged, like ministerial salaries, to top earners in the private sector.
This narrative was reinforced at every opportunity.
One of the favourite lines from the ruling party's candidates at General Election time was how, from humble beginnings, they made their way to the top through this route.
It became a large part of the Singapore brand of meritocracy and accepted as one of the defining values that made it succeed.
I think most people bought into it, and many still believe it continues to be relevant.
What's not so clear though is how this narrative affected ordinary Singaporeans, especially non-graduates, and how they saw their place in society.
Did they feel like second-class citizens, of less value, because they could make only limited contributions to the country's progress, especially in the material sense?
Did they have less confidence in the future, for their children especially, knowing they were not regarded highly and would not be able to join the select ranks?
Or did it spur them to make even greater effort so they could become one of them?
Perhaps some were inspired, but there would be many who might have felt they didn't belong in a country that continually focused on the contributions of the top.
Their diminished sense of self-worth, if not addressed, would alienate them further from the leadership.
Indeed the warning signs are already evident, including the anti-elitism that has grown over the years, surfacing every time there is some perceived misstep or failure of the Government in implementing its policies.
To be fair, the Government has tried in recent years to rebalance its approach in various ways, opening up more options in education, pouring resources into the Institute of Technical Education and the polytechnics, and making its policies more inclusive.
But the elite narrative has been so powerfully broadcast and absorbed over the years that it will take more than these initiatives to bring about a real change in mindset that the PM talked about.
Even more interesting is the question of whether the powers- that-be agree that fundamental change is needed.
I think there are many who continue to believe that, given Singapore's vulnerabilities and constraints, the elite approach isn't wrong.
Exceptional leadership will continue to be a key factor in determining whether Singapore succeeds.
This being the case, can the two narratives - the old and the recently proposed - co-exist?
Can Singapore be a place that continues to place great emphasis on elite leadership with all the support system built over the years intact, and also one which values every individual regardless of his or her education and material possessions?
Or will something have to give?
Singapore isn't the only country trying to manage this balance.
In Japan, there is also intense competition among students to get into the top universities like Tokyo and Kyoto, and to join the major companies like Sony and Toyota or the powerful ministries such as Finance and Trade and Industry.
But it is also a society with a high regard for workers at every level.
The result has been a people known to take great pride in their work and to try to achieve perfection in whatever they do, whether as waiters, factory workers or master craftsmen.
It's a powerful demonstration of what can be achieved when there is respect and recognition all round, and less disparity in status and rewards between the top and the bottom.
Perhaps that's also how the Scandinavian countries are able to achieve a high standard of development in a more egalitarian environment.
Can the new Singapore Story produce similar results?
Maybe it is time to move heaven and earth.

","   WORKERS will get more access to training, career guidance and job market information to help them navigate an economy that is being shaped by the twin forces of technology and competition.
Companies will also partner government agencies and educational institutes to anticipate and identify future skills that will grow in demand.
These new moves were laid out by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam yesterday in a five-year plan which will see Singapore's economy transit to the next level.
Speaking at the launch of the new Lifelong Learning Institute in Paya Lebar yesterday evening, Mr Tharman said technology is sweeping a wave of changes across the global economy.
Automation has begun to replace human tasks across a broad swathe of jobs and even professional jobs such as auditing, legal advice and surgical tasks are being shaped by computerisation and machines, he said.
Developing countries are catching up with Singapore and competition is heating up, he said.
""We cannot change the world, but we can respond to and take advantage of the way the world is changing,"" he said. ""We have to take advantage of new technologies and new global consumer demands to ensure that we remain a vibrant economy, and we give every Singaporean a chance to have quality jobs and fulfilling lives.""
Singapore's economy is evolving to become an advanced economy. This will require workers with a mastery of their skills, honed by experience and time.
""We must cherish and respect the mastery of skills - the knowledge, practice and passion that goes into mastering skills, no matter what the job. That has to be our ethos as a society,"" he said, adding that this is at the ""heart of an inclusive society"".
Singapore will aim to build a continuing education system which will ""intertwine education and the world of work"", he said.
""It (the system) will enable every Singaporean to maximise his potential, from young and through life. It will build an advanced economy and ensure us a fair society,"" he added.
To do this, the Government will provide a full suite of career services that will help Singaporeans plan for their future careers.
Workers will have to be prepared to be lifelong learners and continually equip themselves with new skills, said Mr Tharman.
To smooth the way, employers will be roped in to work closely with the Government to envision the needs of the future economy and workforce.
The standard and quality of the training industry will also be raised, said Mr Tharman.
To drive the new plans forward, a new SkillsFuture Council, chaired by Mr Tharman, will be established. It will be made up of government agencies, the labour unions and employers.
Rounding off his speech, Mr Tharman said that what Singapore needs is ""a meritocracy through life, not a meritocracy that's based on what you achieved at 18 or 24. Where you are assessed on your performance at every stage of your life, regardless of where you came from or what you started with. Assessed on your performance - that's a true meritocracy"".

","   Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Wednesday highlighted the importance of lifelong learning and respect for the mastery of skills, as Singapore enters a new phase of development. He was speaking at the opening of the Lifelong Learning Institute. Here's an excerpt of his speech.
WE ARE essentially embarking on a new phase in our development in education, and as a nation. We have built a school and tertiary education system that is amongst the best-regarded internationally. That remains a real strength for the future. But as we achieve each new stage of development in education, aspirations go up and new possibilities emerge. That's a positive, and we must make the most of these possibilities.
In our next wave of development, we will build a first-rate system of continuing education and training: learning throughout life. It will intertwine education and the world of work in ways that strengthen and enrich both. It will enable every Singaporean to maximise his or her potential, from young and through life.
We are no longer a developing economy. But we are not yet an advanced economy, with the skills, productivity and median incomes equivalent to those of the leading nations.
In our next phase, we will make Singapore an advanced economy, and ensure us of a fair society, with opportunities for every Singaporean to maximise his or her potential and lead fulfilling lives.
We must aspire to move beyond competence and doing a regular job, towards mastering skills. We must cherish and respect the mastery of skills - the knowledge, practice and passion that goes into mastering skills, no matter what the job. That has to be our ethos as a society, starting from young, as employers and colleagues at the workplace, in how we respond as consumers, and in the way we regard each other as fellow-citizens. It's about respecting the innate dignity of every citizen, and the sense of fulfilment that comes from developing a skill and being valued for your contributions to society.
The Aspire (Applied Study in Polytechnics and ITE Review) Committee has made a bold set of recommendations to strengthen opportunities for polytechnic and ITE students to progress and achieve their aspirations.
Our CET (Continuing Education and Training) Masterplan 2020 will also revamp continuous education and training to enable all Singaporeans, regardless of qualifications, to build and deepen their skills throughout their careers.
We will now bring together Aspire's work and the new CET Masterplan, and take them forward. As Prime Minister announced at his recent National Day Rally, we will set up a tripartite council to drive this next phase in developing our people.
We will soon launch this new ""SkillsFuture"" Council. SkillsFuture encapsulates the journey we are embarking on: We want to help everyone develop the skills relevant to the future, and we must build a future based on mastery, in every job.
Everyone has to take ownership of this SkillsFuture journey.
First and foremost, it is about each of us as individuals. We must take ownership of our own learning and development, and control our destinies. The Government will help by ensuring a broad menu of educational and training options - from young, and continuing through your career. But we will also develop a rich framework of educational and career guidance, starting with our secondary schools, moving on to our JCs, polytechnics and ITEs - and accompanying us through life.
Even when you are in secondary school, it is good to have a vague idea of what your aptitudes are, and what you might be interested in. Not choosing a course just because you qualified based on your A-level score or GPA (grade point average), but because it appeals to you, you feel you will be interested enough in the field to keep learning, to keep progressing and applying yourself with passion.
Culture of lifelong learning
THE journey we are taking also requires a broader culture of lifelong learning. Not just learning for the next examination when you are young, not just learning for the immediate needs of the job. In some countries, you walk into a bookshop or a library, you see older folk coming in and browsing, going out with a book. It may be to pick up a new interest or pursue an old one, but it gives them a sense of fulfilment. When we have that broader culture of learning, at home or in the community, when people are learning not just for the immediate task or needs of the job, but because it gives satisfaction, it brings a whole new tone that supports lifelong learning by individuals, from young to old.
Next, employers must take ownership: developing every worker, and valuing their contributions as they advance in skills.
This is probably the greatest challenge ahead in SkillsFuture.
We do not have the advantage of the Swiss or the Germans who developed this from mediaeval times. They developed a deep tradition of collaboration between firms and educational institutions. We do not have that tradition. Neither do we have the tradition of companies working closely together to develop skills in a whole industry. We have to develop this in the next phase of our development.
The Government will work closely with industry and unions to build a future based on advanced skills. We will develop Sectoral Manpower Strategies that identify future skills and needs, and develop clear progression pathways for workers to advance based on skills in each sector, so that employees see the rewards in developing their skills. The WDA will work closely with industry partners to enhance the existing Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) frameworks, to develop the scaffolding of both specialised and broad skills - vertical and horizontal skills - that underpin career progression in each sector.
We should not develop a huge skills bureaucracy to implement this. This cannot be a top-down process. The markets are too fluid for that; technology is changing too quickly. Employers and industry panels must drive this process and Government will provide strong support for them.
What we have to avoid is a vicious cycle, which we sometimes see today in a tight labour market - where employers do not invest in workers because they are not sure they are going to stay. And the worker feeling that ""they are not serious about investing in me, they are not really developing my capabilities beyond what I can do today, I better leave"".
We've got to avoid that vicious cycle, and the way to do it is first, recognising as some employers have found - and if you look at countries like Germany, they have certainly found this - companies that invest in their workers and show them a clear career progression pathway are better able to retain their workers.
Raising the water level of skills
BUT we have to accept that there will be some mobility, and sometimes you lose your best people. That's why we need a sectoral and national skills framework, and why we must get most employers to invest in their workers. That's how we raise the water level of skills for all employees, so that all boats are raised including the SMEs. You might not keep all your employees, but when you hire new people, they come with skills because other companies have invested in their employees, and you invest further in them. And as people move from one job to another within the same industry, there is a better chance that they stay on a path that keeps building up their skills.
The third key group in SkillFuture is educational and training providers. They have to take ownership too, see it as part of their responsibility to prepare students for life and help them upgrade along the way. We are off to a good start, but we need a much deeper and richer industry of training providers, matchmakers, coaches and mentors.
Our educational institutions, including our universities, will play important roles in SkillsFuture. And we have to move beyond thinking there are simple divides between education and work, between pre-employment education and post-employment training, or between nurturing broad skills and developing specialist knowledge. These divides are too simple for the world that's evolving before us. Too simple a divide because of the way technology is changing, jobs are changing and the way education must change if we are to prepare people well for life.
Good jobs of the future
TECHNOLOGY and new approaches to work are blurring the old distinctions between ""thinkers"" and ""makers"". The good jobs of the future will involve both thinking and making, and constant learning - up and down the line and in every field, whether in nursing, in building maintenance, in engineering and factory operations, in the whole digital space or in consumer businesses and professional services.
Designed well, the practical is not at the expense of the academic - the intertwining enriches both. The best educational institutions, like MIT, are precisely about helping students make that connection between the intellectual and the practical, and hence developing their potential in life.
Our educational institutions will also be important anchors in post-employment training, or CET. They will set quality benchmarks for CET delivery. They have expertise and standards of their own to maintain, and their faculty will want to ensure that they are up-to-date with developments in their own fields.
And a whole new vista is opening up in the way in which tertiary institutions are providing for online learning - anywhere and at any stage of life. It does not involve everyone getting a full degree. Some may go for bite-sized modules, some deeper area of knowledge they need at work, or something they want to study purely out of interest.
Private educational institutions (PEIs) too will play a valuable role as we grow our CET landscape. But some re-orientation is going to be required, to ensure that PEIs' programmes are robust, industry-relevant, and beneficial to the people who take their courses. Last year, we had about half of the total private degree enrolment taking business degree programmes. An oversupply of degrees in any one field is never ideal. The market has begun to differentiate between degrees that carry their full worth in knowledge and skills, and those that do not.
A re-orientation in the PEI industry will help it make a positive contribution, by adding diversity and helping working adults in particular, to obtain deeper skills in niche areas or to obtain degrees later in life. What we have to avoid is the degree mills for people fresh out of school that we've seen in many countries. That route will do our young a disservice.
The Government will be a key enabler in all these efforts, by providing resource support and helping to coordinate and tighten the linkages between all players.
A meritocracy through life
THERE is a real strength in our culture that remains relevant to the future. We keep looking for better in our children and grandchildren.
I recently met some of the oldest pioneers in my constituency, so that I could thank them for what they had done for Singapore and present them with their Pioneer Generation packages. Many came with their families, because they all took pride in this. One elderly lady had just one thing to say to me. She pointed at each of her grandsons standing behind her: ""He is at NUS, he is at NTU..."" It had deep meaning. She had succeeded in life. That spirit must remain with us - wanting to help the next generation to do better. But we know that the way in which we achieve our aspirations will have to evolve.
The qualifications we obtain in our youthful years are not the final point. They are not irrelevant - they reflect determination and an ability to learn. But we have to look beyond these early qualifications, and recognise that a whole set of skills matter in how well we perform: applying knowledge in real-world situations that keep changing; developing deeper know-how through practice; collaborating as a team and taking the heat together; or the ability to look for opportunity in the face of challenge. That's true about career success in every field and whichever the qualifications we come with - whether degrees or diplomas or ITE certificates.
What we really have to evolve towards is a meritocracy through life. Not a meritocracy based only on what you have achieved at 18 or 24, but a meritocracy through life, where you are assessed on your performance at every stage of your life, regardless of where you graduated from or what you started with. That is a true and richer meritocracy, and we must aim to develop that. And we can, because we have the culture of aspirations, we have the resources and we are going to work together to achieve this.
We must build on our strengths and move with vigour in this next phase of our development, towards an advanced economy and fair society. Where every Singaporean can discover and achieve his or her full potential, everyone can take pride in building deep skills and be valued for their contributions, and every job respected regardless of the uniform you wear.
LEARNING THAT GIVES SATISFACTION
When we have that broader culture of learning, at home or in the community, when people are learning not just for the immediate task or needs of the job, but because it gives satisfaction, it brings a whole new tone that supports lifelong learning by individuals, from young to old.

167,"A country blessed with an abundance of people and geography can afford to look inwards and live in the short term, for a while: A city-state devoid of natural resources, alas, cannot enjoy such luxuries.
",168,NA," Oct 25, 2014
"," Opinion
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
",NA,"   IN CONTEMPLATING Singapore's next 50 years, public intellectual Ho Kwon Ping focused recently on the staying power of the People's Action Party, which has ruled the country uninterruptedly since 1959 and led it to independence in 1965. He sketched three scenarios in which it could lose power: a freak election, a party split, or an anticipated loss to the opposition. These scenarios might appear like conventional wisdom to some, but they would alarm those who wonder what the future might hold that the past has not taught the present.
It is impossible to say what the next half-century might hold in store, but whoever rules Singapore is likely to discover before too long that certain fundamentals need to be preserved to keep it going. Multi-racialism, meritocracy, secularism and incorruptibility in public life are founding ideals which most Singaporeans believe their country should remain committed to, and uphold in word and deed. These are, or have become, almost akin to the country's reason for being.
Less tangible but no less real is Singapore's ability to take the long view. A country blessed with an abundance of people and geography can afford to look inwards and live in the short term, for a while: A city-state devoid of natural resources, alas, cannot enjoy such luxuries.
In an unrelenting struggle for survival, at least two other Singaporean resources are pre-eminent. The reserves are the first. Built up over decades of fiscal frugality, they embody a concrete commitment to future generations. In that context, welfare is not necessarily dangerous, but dependency is. Political populism could transform welfare into dependency by undermining the ethic of self-reliance and collective care for the future. The balance once struck between fiscal prudence and social cohesion cannot but shift to reflect the demands of an economically more diversified society today, but leaving a legacy for the next generation surely must count as the present's contribution to the next 50 years.
Defence is the second resource. Hardly anything could be more misleading than to believe that Singapore will be safe from invasion or subversion because it has been spared till now. It has survived because of the deterrent ability of its armed forces, credible enough to give potential predators long second thoughts. The presence of a citizens' army built through National Service is at the core of that deterrence. The rise of non-state actors that seek to destroy democratic and secular systems through violence is a new type of threat, but the answer to it lies in the long-established need for strong military and psychological defence. Whoever takes charge of Singapore, some realities won't change.

"," Society
","   THE People's Action Party (PAP) has amended its Constitution for the first time in 32 years to reflect its updated goals for a Singapore that has changed significantly in the past few decades.
It has enshrined in its Constitution, its vision for Singapore first spelt out last year: To ensure opportunities for all Singaporeans, build a fair and just society and develop a ""democracy of deeds"", which relies on a strong sense of collective responsibility and community action.
Party chairman Khaw Boon Wan said the changes, approved at the party conference yesterday, reflect these circumstances.
""As our society becomes more diverse, our economy more mature and our political landscape more contested, it is timely to fundamentally review our overall approach,"" he said.
Members had earlier agreed to adopt the updated vision and directions of the party at the PAP convention in December last year.
Yesterday, six new clauses replaced three old ones in the first update of the PAP's objectives in 32 years. It was only the second time since the PAP's formation in 1954 that a section of its Constitution - which sets out its objectives - was updated. The last change was in 1982.
Speaking yesterday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is PAP secretary-general, noted that Singapore has undergone enormous changes since 1982. ""We have progressed and prospered. Our society has changed. Many problems have been solved, but new challenges have arisen. And the PAP has adapted to the times.""
Mr Lee outlined three directions in particular that the PAP wants to take Singapore in.
First, it must be a nation of opportunity, where everyone has a chance to prove himself, and those who do less well will not be left with nothing. To give everyone a good start, the Government has ramped up early childhood education and is adding more pathways for success, said Mr Lee.
Second, Singapore must be a fair and just society. He said the Government is doing more to help the lower income and build better safety nets. Recent initiatives include the new universal health coverage programme MediShield Life and the Silver Support scheme to support low-income elderly workers.
The third goal is to nurture a ""democracy of deeds"". This is where hard work and self-reliance remain core values and people come together as a community to solve problems.
Mr Lee said: ""You can't leave everything to the Government; individuals have to take initiative, organise themselves, pass the hat around, get things done.""
In a closed-door speech to PAP cadre members before the rally yesterday, Mr Khaw, who is National Development Minister, warned members of tensions even as the party seeks to take the country forward.
Possible fault lines can come from issues such as citizenship, sexual orientation and social values. ""On some of these issues, we may well have to respectfully agree to disagree, without pushing to the point of polarisation,"" he said.
Besides updating the objectives, the PAP also raised its annual subscription fees from $4 to $9. It also made minor changes to other parts of its Constitution covering areas such as the frequency of its party conferences.
tohyc@sph.com.sg
Updated party objectivesTo preserve, protect and defend the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Singapore.To safeguard the freedom, and advance the well-being, of Singaporeans through representative and democratic government.To uphold a multiracial and multi-religious society, where people of diverse backgrounds and beliefs live harmoniously together as fellow citizens, and deepen our national identity and commitment to Singapore.To sustain a vibrant economy which creates good jobs and better lives for all, and enables every Singaporean to achieve their full potential.To build a fair and just society, which encourages individual effort and family responsibility, while ensuring community and government support for the vulnerable and less fortunate.To strengthen an open and compassionate meritocracy, with opportunities for Singaporeans to develop skills in diverse fields, active support for those who start off with less, and ladders to success at every stage of life.To develop a democracy of deeds, where citizenship embodies both rights and duties, and nurtures a sense of collective responsibility and community action.To represent and serve all Singaporeans responsively and responsibly, attentive to immediate concerns, focused on long-term challenges and opportunities, and governing with integrity and honesty.

170,"Earlier this month, Ms Cho Hyun Ah, daughter of Korean Air's chief executive, gained notoriety for forcing a head steward to kneel before her to apologise for a stewardess who did not serve nuts in a bowl on a New York-Seoul flight.

"," News
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
",NA,"   When Mr Michael Lee was growing up in authoritarian-ruled South Korea in the 1980s, people did as they were told and kneeling was a common form of punishment for misbehaviour in schools.
Thirty years on, the now-democratic country is one of the world's most wired and technologically advanced nations and K-pop is well known around the world.
Some things, however, do not change. For one thing, hierarchy and respect for authority are still deeply entrenched in the South Korean mindset.
Age and seniority determine how people speak and interact with one another, and employees are expected to follow orders, especially in family-run conglomerates, or chaebols, where the owner's word is as good as a royal decree.
""The average Korean has never experienced a life free of hierarchical roles,"" said Assistant Professor CedarBough Saeji at the department of Korean studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.
""You would need to be very confident to talk back in a situation where you know (it) is culturally not acceptable.""
Mr Lee, 34, a history teacher at the Singapore Korean International School, said observing hierarchy comes naturally to South Koreans, who nod or bow to show respect.
""Saying 'no' is not easy in Korean culture. People are afraid of losing something - such as money, a job, authority or power - when they say 'no', so they will say 'yes' first to meet the expectations of the leader.""
When things go horribly wrong, South Koreans bow deeply to apologise. In extreme cases, kneeling - which dates back to the imperial era under Chinese influence - is required to seek forgiveness.
Earlier this month, Ms Cho Hyun Ah, daughter of Korean Air's chief executive, gained notoriety for forcing a head steward to kneel before her to apologise for a stewardess who did not serve nuts in a bowl on a New York-Seoul flight.
In May, officials of a rural hospital for chronically ill elderly patients went on their knees to apologise for a fire that killed 21. And some contestants of reality show MasterChef Korea have pleaded for a second chance on bended knees.
""Kneeling is an extreme form of bowing, a grandiose gesture that entails throwing away all of one's pride... It can be a show of gratitude or an apology, begging for forgiveness,"" said Dr Kim Min Kyu, senior research fellow and spokesman for the Northeast Asian History Foundation (NAHF).
Being forced to kneel is deemed disgraceful, but in the Korean Air incident, it won head steward Park Chang Jin massive support and sympathy as he was seen to have suffered injustice meted out by Ms Cho, who resigned soon after as the airline's senior vice-president.
Public outrage over her behaviour was testament to how ordinary South Koreans will no longer tolerate abuse of power by chaebols - Ms Cho ordered the taxiing plane to turn back so as to expel Mr Park, causing a delay.
It also highlighted the need for chaebols - they contribute up to 80 per cent of the country's gross domestic product - to reflect on their autocratic management style for future survival.
Ms Cho, 40, and her father have apologised publicly.
The incident was a ""Watergate moment"" that exposed a major problem in South Korean society - a system of hierarchy and deference that has bred tyranny and power harassment, said Ms Kim Bon Young, a former journalist now living in Singapore.
Last year, public anger flared when a newly appointed Posco Energy executive hit a Korean Air stewardess with a magazine for serving him ramen not to his liking. He was fired, partly for tarnishing the conglomerate's image.
""The dynastic policies of chaebols are not popular any more among South Koreans. People want meritocracy now,"" said Ms Kim.
Corporate hierarchy dictates that junior employees stay in the office until the bosses have left, and senior staff are addressed by their designations with honorifics (think Mr Manager or Mr Director) rather than by their surnames.
But with young people becoming more Westernised and an influx of foreigners who dare to speak up, there is hope that change is in place.
""Foreign employees bring a different dynamic to the work environment,"" said Dr Kim of NAHF. ""As the level of exchange increases at the corporate level, I'm sure Korean corporate culture in terms of hierarchy will also evolve.""
A glimmer of hope lies in education, which has become less strict in discipline. Mr Lee said teachers have stopped spanking students, for instance, as it is considered barbaric. There is also greater awareness that students are entitled to human rights, he added.
Parents, too, have questioned if compliance is always necessary, especially in the wake of April's ferry tragedy that left 250 high school students dead. It is believed that many would have survived had they not obeyed the crew's instructions to stay put in their cabins.
But the culture of hierarchy runs deep.
Ms Kim said she hopes South Koreans will gradually shift this mindset once they realise that, after the ""nut rage"" saga, ""the world is laughing at you because you're so backward"".

Today, however, the drumbeats are not as confident as in the 1990s: the rhythm has either slowed down - as in Malaysia and Singapore - or is in disarray, as in Indonesia.
Over the last month, all three parties have held their congresses. Umno and PAP leaders told cadres to persevere or risk losses in the next elections, while Golkar's leaders acknowledge their crisis.
Are dominant parties of the last century doomed to fail in the 21st?
For the first time in its 50-year history, Golkar has become an opposition party. During former president Suharto's New Order administration (1966-1998), Golkar's authority was unmatched by the opposition parties PDI and PPP. Even after Mr Suharto's resignation in 1998, Golkar was somehow able to stay in government through forming coalitions with the winning parties and appointing members to the Cabinet. After this year's legislative and presidential elections, Golkar chose Mr Prabowo Subianto's opposition Red-White coalition.
Its 2014 National Congress was marked by splits between incumbent Aburizal Bakrie's loyalists and Mr Agung Laksono's supporters. Long-term divisions between party veterans Akbar Tanjung and Jusuf Kalla still exist. Now, Mr Akbar and Mr Kalla differ on whether to join President Joko Widodo's government or to stay in opposition.
In contrast, Malaysia's Umno stayed united after the disastrous 2013 elections, though the possibility of splits looms large in the years to come. At this year's Umno General Assembly, Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is Umno president, warned party members to unite and to kick-start the party's renewal process. He urged senior members to give young members a chance to lead the party. The party's deputy president, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, also urged party members to work harder to regain grassroots support, saying: ""...do or be dead!""
However, Datuk Seri Najib's decision to roll back promised reforms, including the retention of the Sedition Act, signalled his pandering to the party's conservatives and ignoring the progressives. One is reminded of Tun Mahathir Mohamad's decision to retain the draconian Act.
Similar alarm bells sounded during the PAP's 60th-anniversary rally. Party secretary-general Lee Hsien Loong warned cadres to treat the next election, due by early 2017, as a national contest. He also cautioned members about possible losses if they did not work hard. Calling the next election ""a deadly serious fight"", Mr Lee also spoke about the possibility of a freak election result that could see the party lose power. The party's desire for renewal was manifest when several members in their 30s - potential candidates for the next election - spoke during the rally.
So far, the PAP has done everything right to avoid Umno's and Golkar's mistakes. However, the party must not leave any room for complacency. First, PAP has given its young members more say in the party's decisions. It has not repeated Golkar's failures, of totally ignoring the renewal process, or Umno's, of leaving the renewal agenda till too late.
Important players during Mr Suharto's New Order administration continue to form Golkar's leadership strata, including Mr Akbar and Mr Bakrie.
Similarly, it remains doubtful whether Umno's ""warlords"" will heed Mr Muhyiddin's call for them to step aside gracefully in order to save the party. Political parties' renewal and regeneration require at least two elections, and not two years.
In Singapore, Mr Lee's decision to place young candidates in the 2011 election appears to have backfired at first glance. Netizens questioned the fielding of Ms Tin Pei Ling - then 27 years old - who was considered lacking in political experience. Still, the decision has allowed the young candidates to make their mark at the grassroots level.
Second, populism is necessary in politics, but does not guarantee election success. PAP politicians have been actively posting selfies on social media, telling the public of their outreach. However, as Umno members will tell them, repeated selfies, Facebook and Twitter updates and ""I Love PM"" campaigns do not automatically translate into votes. Thus, the PAP must not rely too much on such populist moves. Instead, it must be bold enough to take decisions which are necessary for the country and communicate them effectively.
Lastly, the PAP needs to be daring enough to break from its past, including its past ideology. Political ideologies have to be made relevant to the political realities of the day.
Umno's inability to reinvent itself and move away from racial and religious politics proved costly in the previous elections, and, judging from the recent Umno assembly, this does not look set to change.
The PAP has taken tentative steps to strike out on a new path. For the first time in 32 years, it has amended the party's Constitution, calling for a ""compassionate meritocracy"" and ""democracy of deeds"". The party has pledged more help for those in the lower-income group and the pioneer generation.
The party would be wise to continue to refresh its ideology, and to allow current leaders to state their disagreements with their predecessors in a respectful manner.

172,"Whatever the problem - and the Chinese face some massive, intractable problems that sometimes seem almost primitive to my Singaporean eyes - there is a solid confidence in the country's path, its fundamental system and its inevitable global dominance.
",173," Rachel Chang In Beijing
"," Dec 28, 2014
"," Think
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Air pollution; Middle age; Middle class
","   It was a surprise twist to a familiar conversation.
Over lunch with a Chinese acquaintance a few months ago, we cycled meanderingly though the usual topics educated Beijingers like to cover: air pollution, politics, the social graces of the population, or the lack thereof.
I forwarded my theory that the air pollution problem in Beijing would improve faster than expected, as such is the nature of governance systems with few other stakeholders. Things get done quickly, and Beijing has shown there is little economic, political, social or human cost it considers too high for a priority of the central government's.
He was sceptical, and argued that the lack of private profit opportunities would slow down change. But then, concluding amiably, he said: ""Only one thing is for sure. Life will get better.""
It was a cap not just to our discussion on air pollution, but to everything else we had covered and more - a succinct existential statement that conjured less of an empirical truth than a spiritual one.
It is - I have come to believe over 10 intense months of reporting in China - a statement of national significance, summing up a collective mood of buoyancy and resurgence.
My lunch partner's attitude is so crystallising not because he is as far from a victim of Beijing's propaganda and information control as can be found among locals, which he is.
It is because he is a middle-class, middle-aged man. And for four years as a political reporter in Singapore before my Beijing stint, I had never come across a middle-class, middle-aged Singaporean man expressing anything akin to optimism, not to mention the earnest, uninflected belief that ""life will get better"".
Whatever the problem - and the Chinese face some massive, intractable problems that sometimes seem almost primitive to my Singaporean eyes - there is a solid confidence in the country's path, its fundamental system and its inevitable global dominance.
This showed up consistently in almost all the stories I reported this year. It was there in the way the agonised relatives of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 passengers called Malaysia, to its ambassador's face, ""a small, backward country"", and appealed to the Chinese central government to step in.
It was there when I interviewed a young woman who had fled to the United States at the urging of her father, an environmental activist who had been imprisoned and ill-treated for years.
She said she had only recently learnt about ""Tank Man"", that iconic figure of resistance standing in the way of a line of tanks on June 4, 1989, and marvelled at all that Chinese people were kept from knowing. In the next breath, she told me she wanted to return soon to China, ""a great country and my home"".
It was there when I spoke to Chinese of all ages, profiles and income levels on topics such as kindergarten poisonings, Internet control and rural reform.
Expecting indignation, frustration and anger, so easily expressed in Singapore, I often encountered equanimity and a steadiness that is borne not just from having experienced hard times, but also from expecting better ones.
Patriotism and belonging are complex matters. But what I have seen and felt in Beijing this year is what it is like to live among people in the sweet spot of national development, where reality keeps outstripping expectations, leaders take on messianic auras and the production-possibility frontier seemingly never stands still.
In this national moment, the uncomfortable aspects - the lack of civil and political rights, the arbitrary political governance, racial or economic inequality - are just pulls and tugs on an indifferent momentum.
This, I think, was where the United States was in the 1950s and 1960s, and where Singapore was in the 1980s.
But my generation of Singaporeans are coming of age in the slowing curve of the Law of Diminishing Returns.
The challenges we face, from high property prices to under-employment and retirement inadequacy, are compounded by the knowledge that we missed out on that bit when life just kept getting better.
Our national condition has lately been far from a sense of resurgence and unlimited potential, defaulting instead to a deflating and weary uncertainty.
Despite its enduring backwardness and reprehensible human rights record, China looks ahead to its best days; we seem to always be casting our eyes to the past.
It is by no means just Singapore. In Hong Kong, where I spent a week reporting during the pro-democracy protests in October, the subtext of every interview I conducted was the same: Life is getting worse, and the only solution we see is political change.
Why now, when Hong Kongers have not had democracy in 150 years?
The answer is a complex one that I am not qualified to answer unequivocally. But I think that economic challenges play a bigger role than the identity of the ""authority"" - London or Beijing - that lords over Hong Kong.
I do not think it is a coincidence that political change is also occurring at a rapid pace, by Singaporean standards, in the republic.
When it seems like what has worked before is no longer working, the agitation for change creeps beyond the economic to nip at the fundamental scaffolding of a society.
This is happening across developed societies in the world, from Europe and the US to parts of Asia. No doubt, China will arrive here one day too.
But as I prepare to leave Beijing, I keep thinking about how I am departing a massive, backward country that nonetheless feels exciting and, somehow, uplifting - back to a small, advanced and affluent country that finds itself in an anxious, melancholic state.
As our golden jubilee approaches, the ruling party will emphasise how far we have come; its loudest critics will focus on how its - and Singapore's - best days are over.
I think the truth for most moderate Singaporeans is somewhere in between. Pride at how much we have achieved - with a clear-eyed acknowledgment that we are at a crossroads, and in need of a new vision for the next 50 years.
To me, the challenge Singapore is facing now, at this stage of its development, is a bigger one than China's. It is easy to skip along when economic growth powers ahead.
What is required of us now is digging deep for correction and re-invention, learning not just to add, but also to subtract. It is perhaps here that we discover the fundamental character of Singapore society and whether cohesion truly exists - not just in a time of abundant growth, but in leanness and fractiousness.
I think there is already a new vision being forged, and it looks something like this: one with greater social protection that avoids the rent-seeking, morally hazardous policies of Europe; one with leaders who inspire and empathise; one with a brave acknowledgement of entrenched racial and income privileges that masquerade as meritocracy; one with a more open and creative culture whose strength comes from bearing without breaking the weight of political, social and cultural differences, not from pretending those differences do not exist.
Some might think that the comparison between China, in all its hugeness, and tiny Singapore is a naive one. But boldness is not a function of size, neither is exceptionalism.
We defied the odds for 50 years. Now, for the hard work.

173,"Since 2015 is now upon us, I will use this column to share with readers my three wishes for the New Year. [...]I fear that Singapore is in very grave danger of becoming a market society.
",174," Koh, Tommy
"," Jan 3, 2015
"," Opinion
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," New year; Students
","   IT IS customary to make three wishes for the New Year. Since 2015 is now upon us, I will use this column to share with readers my three wishes for the New Year.
First Wish
I WISH Singapore a very happy golden anniversary. I wish that Singapore will continue to enjoy peace and stability, prosperity with equity, unity with tolerance, safety with vibrancy and freedom with responsibility.
I wish that Singaporeans will continue to believe in and practise our core values of hard work, integrity, meritocracy, compassion, racial and religious harmony, gender equality, freedom from corruption and open economy and open minds.
At a recent forum, a friend from India described Singapore as a case where a government and a people have succeeded in creating something out of nothing. It is not exactly ""nothing"" because we do have three assets: a strategic location, a natural harbour and an intelligent and hard-working people. However, our success story is like a miracle.
Our per capita income is one of the highest in the world. Our people enjoy full employment as well as access to good housing, health care, schools, transport and a healthy environment. Our city grows more beautiful with each passing year.
Singapore is, however, not perfect. There are areas in which we can and should do better. I am disturbed by the inequality in Singapore. We have one of the highest Gini coefficients in the world. I am unhappy that many of our children are growing up in poverty. About a third of our students go to school with no pocket money to buy lunch.
As a trustee of two education trusts, I am reminded each year of the large number of needy students in our schools and tertiary institutions. I was shocked when the president of one of our universities told us recently that 60 per cent of his students need financial assistance.
At the other end of the spectrum, I am worried about the growing number of the elderly poor. Many of them are in poor health and have inadequate savings. Many of them live in loneliness, having no family or been abandoned by family and relatives.
I would like to see Singapore grow in cultural and political maturity. A culturally mature people accept diversity and welcome different points of view. A politically mature society is one in which the vanquished are gracious in their defeat and the victors are magnanimous in their victory.
I hope that Singaporeans would be less obsessed with money and less materialistic.
My mentor, Mr S. Rajaratnam, once said that Singaporeans were in danger of becoming a people who knew the price of everything and the value of nothing.
We did not heed his warning. As a result, I fear that Singapore is in very grave danger of becoming a market society.
Second Wish
ASEAN will be 48 years old this year. Asean has transformed South-east Asia from a cauldron of conflict into a region of peace and prosperity. It is by far the most successful regional organisation in the developing world. I wish Asean great success in the new year.
Asean is the sixth-largest economy in the world. Its ambition is to integrate the 10 economies into a single economy by the end of 2015. The consensus is that the project is 80 per cent complete. Under Malaysia's chairmanship, Asean will attempt to summon the necessary political will to overcome the vested interests and get the job done. Much will depend on the attitude of Indonesia. I hope that President Joko Widodo will back the Asean Economic Community.
All the great powers have a stake in South-east Asia. Instead of trying to keep them out, Asean has wisely invited all of them to join us in building a peaceful and prosperous region. The competition for influence between the United States and China has grown stronger. Relations between China and Japan are tense and burdened by history and nationalism. The 1962 border conflict between China and India continues to cast a shadow over their bilateral relations. There is a huge deficit of trust between and among the great powers.
In this context, Asean has been able to play a positive role. It is the convener and facilitator of the region's forums and institutions, such as, the Asean Regional Forum, Asean Plus Three and the East Asia Summit. This is Asean's indispensable contribution to regional peace. There is no other country or group of countries which can play this role.
What about the future? The future is uncertain because some Asean countries appear to be taking sides in the rivalry between the great powers. Asean is only useful to the region if it remains united, independent and neutral. Only such an Asean can continue to play the central role in regional institutions. I hope that the fiasco in Phnom Penh, in 2012, when the Asean foreign ministers failed to adopt a joint communique will never happen again. In 2015, under Malaysia's chairmanship, I am confident that Asean will remain united, independent and neutral.
Third Wish
MY THIRD wish is for peace in Asia and the Asia-Pacific. What are the threats to peace in our region?
One potential threat to peace is the disagreement between China and Japan over Diaoyu/Senkaku. There are two competing narratives about who has sovereignty over these islands.
Since the former Democratic Party of Japan government nationalised these islands, bilateral relations between Beijing and Tokyo have been on a downward spiral. Until the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Beijing, in November, the leaders of the two countries had not met for more than two years. Following the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the region can heave a sigh of relief. Let us hope that wisdom will prevail and the two neighbours will focus on cooperation rather than conflict. We should see a gradual improvement in the relations between them in 2015.
Another potential threat to peace is the rivalry between China and the United States. Although the two countries engage each other in regular dialogue, at various levels, there is an enormous deficit of trust between them. For this reason, and because of their historical and cultural differences, they do not understand each other and misread each other's intentions.
For example, the Chinese interpret US President Barack Obama's pivot to Asia or rebalancing to Asia as a disguised form of containment. The Chinese attribute their problems with their neighbours to US machinations. The US, on the other hand, suspects that the Chinese agenda is to reduce US influence and leadership in the short term, and to oust them from the region in the long term. The Americans perceive China's activities as an attempt to create a Chinese sphere of influence and to impose Pax Sinica on her neighbours.
Asean's vision is that the region should be open to all but dominated by none. Asean wants our regional architecture to be open and inclusive. Asean refuses to take sides and wants to be friends with all the major powers. Through its forums and free trade initiatives, Asean wants to create a region which is at peace, economically prosperous and socially just.

",175,NA," Jan 17, 2015
"," Forum Letters
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Foreign labor
","   I COULD not agree more with Mr Raymond Koh Bock Swi (""Keys to integrating in S'pore""; Monday).
Singapore is a democratic and modern country. It has long had a socio-political system that advocates meritocracy, open and fair competition, integrity, racial harmony and inclusiveness.
This system has proven to be the right one, as seen in Singapore's success over the past half-century.
Based on our core values, we need to identify, motivate and nurture our limited human resources, which include foreign talent.
We should create a conducive environment and level playing field for foreigners to develop their skills, so they can make significant and unreserved contributions to our nation. We should do our best to integrate them, regardless of where they come from.
Nevertheless, any country that wishes to excel cannot afford to over-rely on foreign talent.
Nations have to strike a healthy balance in their use of human resources. This applies to the appointment of talent to top posts in both the public and private sectors.
In this instance, Singapore cannot be an exception.

","   Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wears pink on the advice of his TV producer, takes photographs with his iPhone and a compact camera, likes home-cooked food best and his favourite Malay dishes are asam pedas and ondeh-ondeh.
Like many Singaporeans, he struggles to balance work and leisure, but gets in a workout every morning, has started learning Pilates and sleeps six to seven hours a night.
In an alternate world, he would have liked to be a teacher or lecturer.
These were some personal nuggets he shared in a live 45-minute Facebook chat yesterday from the social media giant's office in Cecil Street.
He said in a Facebook post in the evening: ""I had a hard time keeping up with all the questions coming in, but it was an interesting and successful engagement.""
Mr Lee had invited questions at 11.30am, and started answering them 15 minutes later.
By noon, more than 500 questions had flooded in. By the time the session ended at 12.30pm, there were more than 1,600. He managed to respond to just about 30, including several on policy issues in the news recently, like transport and Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings.
Some 363,500 people saw Mr Lee's chat, Facebook said yesterday.
There are 3.4 million active Facebook users in Singapore.
Transport was a hot topic, with over 100 questions on everything from petrol prices to the fare increases announced last week. (See other report.)
Mr Farouk Yusoff asked about his money in the CPF and the Minimum Sum Scheme, saying: ""Dear PM Lee, why can I not use my CPF the way I want to? I want to spend it on my family while (I'm) still alive.""
Mr Lee replied that the CPF savings are just the basic amount to take care of everyone in old age. ""The Minimum Sum is not a lot. Every society has some arrangement like that, and ours is the CPF.""
One participant asked if the upcoming MediShield Life scheme to provide health insurance coverage for all might be a drain on Singapore and result in cutbacks in other areas.
Mr Lee said: ""This will be an issue if we are not careful. The Government does not have unlimited money, so if we spend more on health care we will have less to spend elsewhere, or must raise taxes to pay for the spending. We must get the right balance.""
Mr Avin Look told Mr Lee that his retired parents, who need regular follow-ups at polyclinics and specialist centres, say they pay a lot for non-standard prescribed medications because there are no generic ones in the market.
He wanted the Pioneer Generation benefits to be extended to such medicines as well, especially for the elderly.
Mr Lee replied that there are a lot of non-standard medicines like vitamin pills. ""So we have to be careful. But if the doctor thinks the non-standard item is essential, and your parents can't afford it, we have a scheme to subsidise them. Where do your parents live? Perhaps I can ask their MP to help them?""
In response to a query by Mr Allen Yu on immigration, he said Singapore would stay open to immigrants, even as he noted that some businesses found it hard to get workers due to recent limits. ""We have set our immigration policy for now, but will review it after a few years.""
Mr Lee ended the chat by uploading a 30-second video, saying he enjoyed the session.
""I'm sorry I couldn't answer all of the questions you have asked, but thank you for participating,"" he said. ""I will do this again one day. I hope you'll be there again. Next time, I'll try hard to get to more questions.""
Singapore Kindness Movement general secretary William Wan, who was among the netizens posing questions online, told The Sunday Times later that although some of those taking part were not serious, there was ""quite a bit of courtesy and respect"".
The general conversation online can be quite nasty, he said, but added: ""In this case, I'd like to think that people still have
respect for the PM.""
yanliang@sph.com.sg
ON LIGHTER MATTERS:
Lim Jialiang: Why do you keep wearing pink shirts? I like pink too! Let's go to Pink Dot this year!
PM Lee: My TV producer tells me to do that!
Michael Gressick: Your photos are great! What kind of camera do you use? If it is your phone, any touch-up or editing with a mobile app?
PM Lee: iPhone, and a compact camera (especially at night). I use Lightroom to edit, and also Lightzone, which is free but very good.
Farisa Ann (in Malay): What are your favourite Malay dishes?
PM Lee: Asam pedas and ondeh-ondeh!
Inez Wee: Do you prefer traditional coffee or European coffee like latte, cappuccino or espresso?
PM Lee: I don't usually drink coffee, but once in a while I try whatever brew is being offered (yesterday at the Launchpad @ one-north, I had a cup of kopi-si)
Christine Aw: If you were not the PM, what would you want to be?
PM Lee: A teacher or lecturer. It is fun to interact with young people.
Shyam Meghji: I see that you wear Jawbone (a wristband that tracks activity) all the time. May I know how many steps you take in a day and your average hours of sleep?
PM Lee: I sleep six to seven hours a day, and walk on average 7,000 to 8,000 steps. Once in a while I do more than 10,000 steps, and the app sings and dances!
Wei Hann Loo: Dear PM Lee, given your hectic work schedule, how do you balance your work with family and personal life?
PM Lee: Always a struggle, like everyone else. But I exercise every morning, and try to take a walk with my wife on weekends. I am also just starting to learn something new - Pilates!
ON MINISTER CHAN CHUN SING JOINING NTUC:
Ramesh Subbaraman: You have consented to post Minister Chan Chun Sing to NTUC full time from April. Which areas of work in NTUC and tripartism do you hope to see him building on in the years ahead? What's most critical for Singapore when it comes to worker issues?
PM Lee: You should ask Chun Sing that question! Certainly worker upgrading is important, so that our people can do better jobs. So is working with employers and the Government, to cope with the rapid changes in our economy. We talk about restructuring just as a concept, but for a worker whose job is restructured it can be a very painful and difficult thing.
ON SOCIAL GRACES:
William Wan: What is your view on our evolution as a gracious society? In what ways are we making progress and how can we continue to make progress?
PM Lee: We have made progress, but must work harder. For example, in some MRT stations (like Bishan) commuters queue up to get into the carriages. We should do that in all our stations. I know the Singapore Kindness Movement is doing good work. I will post about it on FB soon, so that more Singaporeans learn about what you are doing! (Mr Wan is general secretary of the kindness group).
ON HIRING FOREIGN WORKERS:
Jeff Wu: I run a small business with my girlfriend and we are having a very hard time finding Singaporeans willing to work entry-level jobs... Easing restrictions on the foreign worker quota would allow us to grow and thrive.
PM Lee: Jeff, many SMEs have experienced the same problem as you. We have tightened on foreign workers, but we have not shut them off. Some people wanted us to stop foreign workers altogether! We have to continue to be tight, but we are watching carefully to make sure we don't overdo things. This is one issue DPM Tharman (Shanmugaratnam) is studying.
ON TRANSPORT COSTS:
Alanna Si Jia Tan: Why is it that our transportation costs keep on increasing? Can't the Government take back shares within the transportation system such that the prices don't increase every year, and work with the privatised operation? The price of fuel drops but our rates increase again. Hong Kong's MTR has dropped their transport fees to give back to the society. What about us? Can we stop experiencing fare hikes?
PM Lee: This is a difficult problem everywhere. Nobody likes to pay more for train and bus rides. Yet it costs money to run the trains and buses, and to improve the service standards. It is not true that SBS Transit earns huge profits. In fact in recent years their bus operations have not been making money. The Government subsidises public transport heavily - we are spending billions every year building MRT lines, and also spending almost a billion on the (bus services enhancement programme) BSEP. But commuters too have to pay a fair share.
This year fuel prices have dropped. According to the formula, fares should go down too. But we have half an adjustment left over from last year, so overall fares have to go up a bit. Hope you will understand.
ON HDB FLATS FOR SINGLES:
Atiqah Jamal: Will you build more HDB flats for singles? Will you allow singles younger than 35 to own a flat?
PM Lee: We are indeed building more HDB flats, and singles can now apply for them. But I don't think we will reduce the age below 35. It is not so old!
ON A WOMAN DPM:
David Teh (in Mandarin): When will Singapore have a woman Deputy Prime Minister?
PM Lee: Now that we have female ministers, of course it is possible to have a female Deputy Prime Minister! We recognise meritocracy, and don't make a distinction between male and female.

","   SINGAPORE'S ability to remain relevant depends on the country being an extraordinary success, said veteran diplomat Bilahari Kausikan at a forum yesterday.
The reason, he added, is that Singapore is small and in Southeast Asia - two fundamental vulnerabilities the country must always remember.
In his paper on the sovereignty of small states, he said the bedrock of relevance is success and ""success must be defined first of all in economic terms"".
Although this goes against the view in some circles that individuals have other worthier goals in life beyond economics, Mr Kausikan said the country as a whole does not have the luxury of taking such a path.
""A world of sovereign states is in fact a rat race, and often a vicious one, in which the weak go to the wall. There can be no opting out for a sovereign state,"" said the Ambassador-at-Large and policy adviser of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the one-day forum organised by the Institute of Policy Studies.
The forum, with about 900 participants who include academics and officials, discussed the choices Singapore made in becoming an independent city-state and surviving as one.
Mr Kausikan, who was speaking during a panel discussion, said if Singapore was not successful, it risked being outclassed by its larger neighbours who have natural resources that it lacked.
""A small state cannot be just ordinarily successful. If we were no different from our neighbourhood, why should anyone want to deal with us rather than our larger neighbours who, moreover, are well endowed with natural resources?
""To be relevant, we have to be extraordinary,"" he added.
What is more, Singapore differs from the rest of South-east Asia in terms of its fundamental political principles and ethnic composition, he said.
It is a multiracial meritocracy. Also, it is ""a Chinese-majority country, with neighbours whose own Chinese populations are a less than fully welcome minority, and whose attitudes towards their own Chinese populations are too often projected upon us"", he noted.
""A Chinese-majority multiracial meritocracy that has been extraordinarily successful compared to its neighbours is often taken as an implicit criticism of differently organised systems,"" he said.
He added that this reality is here to stay: ""The intensity of such attitudes waxes and wanes... but these complexities are never going to go away, and we ignore or deny them only at peril of compromising our sovereignty.
""Being extraordinary does not make us loved, but it is the price we must pay for survival and autonomy.""
National University of Singapore historian Tan Tai Yong, who moderated the morning discussion, said Singaporeans should also keep the country's history and geography in perspective.
Singapore had been part of larger political entities for most of its 700-year history, he said.
Even today, Singapore's existence as an independent city-state makes it a rarity in the world, he added, noting that only Monaco and the Vatican City have a similar political status.

","   I HAVE known Tan Sri Kadir Mohamad, the former KSU (the equivalent of our permanent secretary) of Wisma Putra, for more than 30 years. We first met in 1984 when he was the deputy chief of mission at the Malaysian Embassy in Washington, DC and I was a newly minted first secretary at our embassy.
In the subsequent decades our paths often crossed - the world of South-east Asian diplomacy is not large and Malaysia is our closest neighbour - and on occasion I worked with him in Asean and on some bilateral matters. So when I heard that he had written a book on Malaysia-Singapore relations, I hastened to procure a copy.
The content was as I expected: a very journeyman-like effort. There were no significant errors of fact on bilateral issues that I could detect. Mr Kadir is nothing if not a consummate professional, and contrary to popular belief, good diplomats of every country generally tell the truth and stick to the facts, although there is no obligation to always tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
In any case, all the most important facts have long been placed in the public domain, mainly by Singapore in answers to parliamentary questions or by the release of documents on water talks more than a decade ago. A reader expecting dramatic new revelations will be disappointed.
Mr Kadir's interpretations of the facts are of course different from the interpretations that I or other Singapore diplomats would have placed on the same facts. But that is only to be expected, and I am not inclined to quibble with him.
A different interpretation cannot change the most important fact of all: On almost every bilateral issue the book deals with - water, Pedra Blanca, the bridge and land reclamation - the outcome was not one that Malaysia had set out to achieve.
Diplomats try to promote their countries' interests. So it is entirely understandable that in the twilight of his career, a distinguished Malaysian diplomat would want to place his version of events on the record and vent a little. It would be churlish to deny him even this satisfaction.
I will only take issue with his conclusion, encapsulated in the title of his book and the thread running through it, that it has been ""Fifty Years Of Contentions"". Of course, Malaysian and Singapore interests often clashed. Relations between neighbours are always more complicated than relations between distant countries. But the interests of our countries have at least as often coincided.
Diplomacy is not, or at least ought not to be, a zero-sum game. Nor should any one aspect of any relationship be allowed to colour the entire relationship.
Although we contended over bilateral matters, Malaysia and Singapore have simultaneously worked together very well on other issues, for example as we did in Asean and the United Nations during the decade-long struggle in the 1980s - which coincided with some tense episodes in bilateral relations - to prevent a fait accompli in Vietnamese-occupied Cambodia. We still cooperate closely in Asean.
And even when the outcome of bilateral contentions was in Singapore's favour, Malaysian interests were not irrevocably hurt. The 2010 agreement on the implementation of the 1990 Points of Agreement on railway land was beneficial to both countries. Malaysia still buys cheap processed water from Singapore.
Mr Kadir's failure to give sufficient recognition to the cooperative aspect of bilateral relations is, I think, due to the over-emphasis he places on what he describes as Mr Lee Kuan Yew's ""baggage full of bitterness and a heart filled with anger"" over Separation. He describes his book as ""...the story of how one man dictated the form and substance of relations...""
Separation was of course a traumatic event for both countries that did indeed shape and set in motion the essential dynamic of Malaysia-Singapore relations. But not in the way Mr Kadir thinks it did.
He places far too much emphasis on the personal element. It is undeniable that Mr Lee was a dominant personality in Singapore politics and policymaking for many years. But I suspect that in trying to understand Singapore, Mr Kadir looked in a Malaysian mirror and saw Dr Mahathir Mohamad.
Both were dominant personalities in the government and politics of their respective countries but not in entirely the same way.
Far more than Dr Mahathir, Mr Lee worked within and respected the Cabinet system. Mr Lee was acutely aware that any agreement he reached with Malaysia had to outlast his tenure in political office and even his lifetime and therefore sought collective agreement.
By contrast, even after he retired as prime minister, Dr Mahathir attempted to influence the way his successors dealt with Singapore on bilateral issues when he did not agree with them. Many Malaysians certainly believe he tries to influence Malaysian domestic politics and policies to this day.
And the metaphor of ""baggage"" used by Mr Kadir and others is a singularly inappropriate - and simplistic - way to try and understand the complex dynamic of bilateral relations set in motion by Separation. ""Baggage"" connotes something that is carried by an individual or a group of individuals and which can be jettisoned or changed if necessary. The implication is that if this does not occur, it is only because those individuals are unwilling to do so or have been prevented from doing so. And Mr Kadir argues, or at least strongly implies, that this was what in fact Mr Lee did.
But the reason for Separation, or rather the reason why, as Mr Kadir bluntly and perhaps less euphemistically argues in his first chapter, ""it was necessary to expel Singapore"" goes far beyond individual personalities.
Singapore is organised on the basis of multiracial meritocracy. Malaysia is organised on the principle, politely described in Article 153 of its Constitution as ""the special position of the Malays"", but more popularly and politically potently understood as ""Ketuanan Melayu"".
Time has eased the sharp edges of Separation, and time will certainly ease them further. But it is difficult to conceive of either Singapore or Malaysia discarding their respective fundamental organising principles. They are embedded in our societies and political systems, not by the will or whim of any individual, however powerful, but by the collective choice of the majority in both countries.
There are of course Singaporeans who do not agree with the Government and some do not like Mr Lee. Some Singaporeans may well already have only the vaguest of notions of who Mr Lee is and what he has done. But I have yet to meet any serious-minded Singaporean who really wants to abandon our fundamental organising principle and adopt something akin to the Malaysian system.
Nor can I imagine Article 153 of the Malaysian Constitution ever being repealed. We may have been once one country, but are now and for evermore two countries. The existential tension between two countries organised on fundamentally irreconcilable political principles that defines the dynamic of Malaysia-Singapore relations is not going to go away and so must be managed and is being managed.
Once this is understood, a balanced and holistic view of Malaysia-Singapore relations becomes possible. It is a relationship based, like every other interstate relationship throughout history, on national interests, some of which will converge and some of which will diverge.
The complications in Malaysia-Singapore relations are the inevitable ones of proximity and an entangled history. They have some special characteristics, but that is in general not particularly unusual between neighbours anywhere. Every close relationship has its own special characteristics.
It is the purpose of diplomacy to broaden the area of convergence between national interests whenever possible and manage the tensions when interests diverge. That Singapore and Malaysian diplomats - Mr Kadir included - have succeeded in doing so at least as often as we have failed should not be overlooked.
Even if Mr Kadir is right that ""the bitterness and anger towards Malaysian leaders that engulfed Lee Kuan Yew on 9 August 1965 ... remains with him until this day"" - and I think Mr Kadir is profoundly mistaken, entirely misreads Mr Lee, and may well be unconsciously projecting some of his own attitudes onto him - it did not prevent Mr Lee from concluding what was, until the 2010 railway land agreement, the most important Malaysia-Singapore agreement: The 1990 Linggiu Dam agreement.
In his speech at the launch of Mr Kadir's book, former prime minister Abdullah Badawi cut to the core when he said Malaysia cannot blame Singapore entirely for bilateral problems, but ""... must also look at ourselves in the mirror"". Good advice.

","   I READ with concern the report on the three international schools expanding to meet the demand from Singaporeans (""Home-grown global schools in demand""; yesterday).
Singapore's education system has been built on the bedrock of meritocracy: Regardless of social background, students would have access to the best schools as long as they meet the grade. More importantly, wealthier students in this system would not be able to ""pay"" their way into the best schools.
It is very worrying that the top schools in Singapore have now spun off private arms which essentially pre-select only those who can afford it.
Such a parallel private school system for wealthy Singaporeans runs counter to the fundamental meritocratic principles upon which Singapore was founded.
With increasing income inequality, society will become stratified, as wealthier parents are able to afford an advantage for their children.

","   WHAT is your age? Your race? Neither question would seem out of place in an opinion poll in Singapore.
But try this: Are you working, middle or upper class?
The question might seem unusual because, for a long time, the concept of class has been taboo in Singapore, intuitively at odds with the idea of a meritocratic society where people can advance by dint of hard work.
But class is a defining division in society here, argues National University of Singapore (NUS) sociologist Tan Ern Ser. The class a person falls into shapes his attitudes and choices, Associate Professor Tan says in a new study titled ""Class and Social Orientations"". It is scheduled to be published in the next quarter.
Prof Tan based his findings on a 2011 survey of 2,700 Singaporeans, who were asked for their views on a range of issues, such as factors for success and politics.
Results showed the working, middle and upper classes tended to have distinct attitudes, but it was harder to discern trends across races and age groups.
By class, Prof Tan means income as well as the socioeconomic group someone thinks they are part of. By and large, there is a big overlap - most middle-income people think they are part of the middle class, for instance.
While class distinctions are not new, they have come into sharper focus in recent years amid greater worries about income inequality.
Even as the Government has boosted help for the lower-income to narrow the divergence between the haves and the have-nots, the income gap still crept up slightly last year, according to the annual Key Household Income Trends survey released this week.
""Class plays a big role in shaping how people think,"" says Prof Tan, who heads the Institute of Policy Studies' Social Lab.
He adds: ""In many ways, class can explain differences in how Singaporeans perceive their career prospects, how satisfied they are with their lives, and how much they can influence policymaking in Singapore.""
The ingredients for success
FOR starters, all classes are still confident that meritocracy works in Singapore, but there may be signs that social mobility is slowing for the lower and middle classes.
The respondents, aged 15 to 74, were asked to rank six factors they thought are needed for success.
The results, from most to least important, were: education, ability, hard work, connections, luck and a rich family background.
But the survey also picked up an interesting trend suggesting that classes are becoming somewhat entrenched: If your father is university-educated, you are more likely to be as well.
The finding was based on information that respondents aged 25 and older gave about their education level and that of their fathers.
Out of the university-educated fathers, 63 per cent had children with degrees.
But out of the fathers with secondary-school qualifications, only 37 per cent had children who made it to university. And of the dads with primary or lower education, just 12 per cent had children with degrees.
The figures tell the story that while all classes have chances to improve their lot in life, ""as much as we talk about meritocracy, background still matters. The class you come from does influence your destination"", says Prof Tan.
The survey also asked people what they believed they needed to achieve ""success"".
Those in the upper class - households that earn $8,000 or more a month - are more likely to believe that having connections and a rich family are important.
But those in the working class - households making up to $4,000 a month - tend to believe more in luck as an ingredient for success.
Says Prof Tan: ""Having a degree is not enough. Social capital matters, and knowing people is helpful. I'm sure there are a lot of graduates coming out, with a degree but no connections, so they don't get an internship and they don't get their first job.""
To help those in the working class who have neither a rich-family background nor connections, NUS sociologist Vincent Chua suggests promoting relations between classes as actively as relations between ethnic groups.
Such connections create chances for people from different classes to share resources with each other, adds Dr Chua, who studies elite school networks here.
Current efforts at levelling the playing field at the early stages in kindergarten are commendable, he says. For instance, the Ministry of Education has set up its own kindergartens in the heartland to provide quality education at affordable rates to the lower- and middle-income groups.
The Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme also subsidises the pre-school fees of children from low-income homes.
""But there is more work to be done. While every school can be a good school, the quality of resources is simply not the same in terms of networks, school histories and exposure,"" says Dr Chua.
Getting involved in politics
THE upper and middle classes felt more politically alienated than their working-class counterparts, with those earning $8,000 per household or more a month being the most dissatisfied.
Prof Tan estimates that half of Singaporeans are in the middle and upper class.
The study defined such alienation as the gap between people's desire to take part in the political process, and the opportunities they think they have to do so.
This suggests that the upper and middle classes want to participate much more than they currently do in politics, but feel they cannot. ""These are the groups to reach out to,"" says Prof Tan.
Political parties must show that the views of these groups matter, says political watcher and Singapore Management University law associate professor Eugene Tan. ""They do not like to be talked down to. They want to be spoken with as equals,"" he says.
One way parties can win over the upper class, who are unlikely to worry about bread-and-butter issues, is by addressing their views on ""post-material"" concerns, such as national identity, social justice and environmental protection. But parties must be genuine, as ""'window-dressing engagement' is going to result in more alienation and cynicism"", warns Prof Eugene Tan, a former Nominated MP.
It may also be harder for the ruling People's Action Party in particular to win over politically alienated voters, since ""the political system is very much dominated by the ruling party and these people feel somewhat alienated from it"", he adds.
By and large, options to participate in the political process abound, he says. For example, people can write to office-holders or the newspapers, blog, join a civil society group, or help out at Meet-the-People sessions.
But on the part of the middle and upper classes, they should not expect preferential treatment in the process of political participation, as the views of others have to be taken into account as well, Prof Tan adds.
Taking care of the family
CLASSES also support their families for different reasons.
Broadly speaking, more top earners tend to look after their parents or have children out of love, while more lower-income earners appear to do so out of social obligation.
About 68 per cent of top earners say that they financially support their parents out of love, compared to 45 per cent of those in the lowest income tier.
The other two reasons - which more lower earners cited - thrown up in the study were repaying parents for raising them, and the expectation that children should support their parents financially.
Similarly, 75 per cent of people in the top income tier said that having someone to love was their main motivation for raising children. Only 35 per cent of low-income respondents said the same.
But social obligations are not a reliable basis for such transfers between generations, argues Prof Tan Ern Ser. He cites data showing that seniors who do not have enough to live on also tend to have poor relationships with their children, who may themselves be poor as well.
""People who need the most support may turn out to be the least likely to get it,"" he says.
This is why experts argue that policymakers should also look to strengthening family relations, while continuing to boost retirement adequacy through programmes like the upcoming Silver Support scheme, which will pay a bonus to needy seniors without enough savings or family support.
Ms Anita Fam, a council member of Families For Life, a non-profit organisation that promotes resilient families, says the survey results point to a need to help working- and middle-class families in supporting their children and their ageing parents.
On one level, this involves more community-based support like eldercare facilities for families who want their ageing parents to live with them, but are unable to look after them in the day.
On another level, families could do with emotional support and encouragement to strengthen familial bonds, reckons Ms Fam.
Families For Life, for example, comes up with opportunities and ideas for families to spend meaningful time together, such as organising picnics, she says.
NUS sociologist Paulin Straughan calls for more flexible work arrangements, so that parents feel free to spend time with their children without fear that their careers will suffer.
And Prof Tan Ern Ser suggests public campaigns that emphasise love, to encourage family members to support each other: ""When love prevails, filial piety becomes a by-product of love.""
Sharing the pie with whom?
WHEN it comes to social support, most Singaporeans expect that the working class and the middle class should get some help from the Government.
About 70 per cent of respondents believed that middle-income people should qualify for government subsidies. In addition, some 28 per cent believed middle-income people should get more cash transfers. However, both these ideas received more support among the middle class than the working and upper classes.
This expectation of the middle class reflects a higher demand for the Government to support their aspirations and reduce their anxieties, says Prof Tan.
Subsidies to help the middle class with the cost of living are actually already in place, says Nanyang Technological University economist Walter Theseira.
For example, public housing is priced at a discount, and investing in public transport infrastructure most benefits the middle class.
But as for entitlements for the middle class such as cash transfers, economists say that Singapore should be careful of treading this path.
Supporting a large middle class with permanent entitlements is not financially sustainable, as taxes on the top 20 per cent will have to be ""unbearably high"", says Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin.
Sharing the fiscal windfall with the middle class is more justifiable in boom years, but these exceptional years are becoming less frequent, he adds.
""The Government will have to guard against over-promising on entitlements for the broader middle class, especially when demographic pressures will intensify in the coming years,"" says Dr Chua.
Identifying with class
THE upshot of all this is that class divides may matter more than we think. ""If Singaporeans begin to feel that they're stuck in life, then class will be an issue,"" says Prof Straughan.
""If people feel they will never move up in life, no matter how hard they work, then they will begin to identify with people in the same class, rather than with larger society,"" she says.
""When people feel that there are others like them - 'it's not just me, everybody else suffering the same' - then they are more likely to be vocal and push for action,"" she explains. At the same time, practices within classes become institutionalised.
This is how personal positions on issues solidify around class lines, especially for members of the working class.
But Singapore is not at this stage, says Dr Theseira.
""Class is not unimportant, but it's not something that we've inherited for a very long time,"" he says, compared to the ""landed gentry"" class in Britain, which has been around for centuries.
In Singapore, classes are much less entrenched as social mobility was fairly rapid in the 1960s to 1980s, and many families made their fortunes only in the last one or two generations, he notes.
Therefore, individuals - of all classes - can still turn things around for themselves.
""Class means something different when you have mobility and opportunities to change your fortunes. As long as Singapore continues to have that, class should be less indicative of who you are deep down as a person,"" he says.

","   SINGAPOREANS aged 25 and above will get $500 from next year and more top-ups in future to offset the cost of courses.
The grant is part of the Government's push for workers to develop the skills and mastery needed to take Singapore's economy to the next level.
New study awards and subsidies will also be rolled out while employers and schools will be roped in to help students discover their interests early on, through structured internships.
These moves will cost the state around $1 billion a year, up from the $600 million a year spent now on continuing education schemes.
This investment in training will ensure that Singapore stays competitive, said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam yesterday.
Cultivating a strong culture of lifelong learning will also empower Singaporeans to develop themselves and move up.
""We must become a meritocracy of skills, not a hierarchy of grades earned early in life,"" said Mr Tharman. ""A society where people keep learning and pushing their potential and are valued for their contributions at each stage of their life.""
To drive these plans forward, the Government has launched the SkillsFuture initiative, which encompasses subsidies, study awards and training programmes.
A key feature is the SkillsFuture Credit account for all Singaporeans. The initial $500 grant and top-ups will go to this account, which can be used for a broad range of courses offered by government training agencies.
Mr Tharman stressed that Singaporeans should not rush to use their credits as they will not expire and can be used throughout their lives.
While the SkillsFuture Credit is aimed at helping Singaporeans in general upgrade their skills, targeted schemes will be introduced for specific groups of workers.
Workers aged 40 and above making mid-career switches will get enhanced subsidies that cover at least 90 per cent of the fees of training and education courses offered by the Ministry of Education and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency.
Those who want to develop specialised skills that are needed to support growing sectors will be offered study awards and fellowships. From this year, study awards will be introduced and increased eventually to 2,000 annually to help specialist workers.
Another 100 fellowships a year will be given out from next year to support education and training programmes.
These are funded by employers, the National Trades Union Congress, the public and the Government.
But Mr Tharman said incentives and new training schemes alone will not transform Singapore into a society which values skills. The mindsets of workers and employers must change too.
""We have to view the education that we get when we are young as but the starting point of a journey of personal learning and self-renewal throughout our lives,"" he said.
""Whichever the job, we must want to master what we do, and gain satisfaction from it.""
Employers must also do their part to help workers reach their full potential.
The Government is also pushing for more collaboration between training institutions, unions, trade associations and employers to chart future skills demand and plan for them.
While changing Singapore's social and economic culture will take time, it is important that the process starts now.
""We can only get to where we want in the long term by taking steps now, moving ahead relentlessly and never thinking that the status quo will get us to a better place,"" he said.

181,"Another big change is in wages. Since the 1960s, the average pay of a lower-income worker has risen by more than five times, and that of a median-income worker by six.

","   A MEASURE of any government Budget is the extent to which it positions a nation for the future, rather than merely plugging gaps in the present or, worse, making up for past mistakes.
The two clearly future-focused parts of Budget 2015 are SkillsFuture, to help workers gain expertise and mastery, and new moves to spur small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to innovate and internationalise.
The same cannot be said for the Central Provident Fund changes. Although welcome, they effectively restore contribution rates for older workers and salary ceilings to what they were before controversial cuts in 2003 that have eaten into people's retirement savings.
But first, SkillsFuture.
It ""marks a major new phase of investment in our people"", said Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam. It is a vision to transform Singapore from ""a hierarchy of grades earned early in life"" to a ""meritocracy of skills"". And it puts the skilled worker front and centre, which is apt for a nation whose only resource has always been its people.
Mr Tharman shared an anecdote to show how far Singapore workers have come, a story centred on Jalan Tukang in Jurong, so named as tukang is Malay for skilled worker. It used to be home to the Swan Socks factory, founded with Japanese investment, opened by former deputy prime minister Goh Keng Swee in 1964 and one of the first to offer significant employment for women.
Today, Swan Socks is no more. In its place are Tukang Innovation Park and MedTech One, a dedicated facility for the fast-growing medical technology industry.
Another big change is in wages. Since the 1960s, the average pay of a lower-income worker has risen by more than five times, and that of a median-income worker by six. Where Singapore used to lag behind other Asian economies, its median wage is now higher than that of Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan and only 10 per cent lower than that in Japan.
But workers here and worldwide now face a brave new world where jobs are constantly reshaped by technology, and ""no one can honestly tell what they will be doing a decade or two after leaving school"".
Singapore workers must be prepared to learn and adapt at every stage of their lives. The Government will help them with deposits and regular top-ups to their SkillsFuture Credit accounts, starting with $500 for every Singaporean aged 25 and older. The aim is to enable ""every individual to decide on his or her own learning journey: when to go for fresh infusions of skills or knowledge, and whether it should be in specialised professional training, acquiring soft skills or developing a new interest"", Mr Tharman said.
Also in the pipeline are professional career counselling and internships for students, enhanced education and training subsidies for mid-career workers, and SkillsFuture Study Awards and Fellowships.
They form an exciting vision to empower workers to chart their own way forward. The estimated cost: $1 billion a year on continuing education and training from now until 2020, up from $600 million a year for the last five years.
Success, however, hinges on how well the plans are executed, and many questions hang over how the vision will be translated into reality. Singaporeans, too, will have to step up to the challenge of lifelong learning.
The efforts of workers have to be complemented by those of enterprises. The bar for them has been raised, from value adding - which may have earned them a good living in the past - to the next frontier of value creating.
The Government will stay the course on economic restructuring, even though its productivity drive has so far produced dismal results in non-export sectors. Mr Tharman appealed for yet more time, saying ""the business transformations that underpin a major shift in productivity will take time, and it also takes time for the market to restructure, with adopters of new ideas and technologies gaining share at the expense of those who stand still"".
Budget 2015 sharpens support for SMEs that innovate, by providing grants, R&D investments and a pilot venture debt risk-sharing programme to help high-growth enterprises secure financing. To succeed, these will have to yield better results than previous rounds of productivity incentives.
On the second big theme of strengthening social security, CPF changes took centre stage. The big criticism here is that several changes announced yesterday simply reverse what some consider to be ill-judged policy decisions of the past. These include significant cuts to contribution rates of workers aged 50 and above - which many resented and found unfair - and the lowering of the CPF salary ceiling from $6,000 to $4,500. Both took place in 2003, in the wake of the Sept 11, 2001 attacks and the Sars outbreak, which caused unemployment to spike.
What accounts for this course correction? Well, the employment rate among older workers has risen, as Mr Tharman noted, from 64.4 per cent in June 2004 to 71.4 per cent in June last year, an improvement he linked to schemes such as the Special Employment Credit introduced post-2003.
Still, as any financial planner knows, time is of the essence in building up one's nest egg and the CPF cuts cost thousands of workers over a decade in lost savings.
Yesterday's announcement that the CPF Board will pay an extra 1 per cent on the first $30,000 in the accounts of members aged 55 and older, will be a significant boost to those with lower balances. Lower-income seniors with insufficient CPF savings will also benefit from a new Silver Support Bonus that tops up their retirement income every quarter.
In this age of austerity, what is worth celebrating is that Singapore still has enough in its coffers to make big investments for the future - including $26 billion on public transport infrastructure over the next five years - and still balance its Budget.
But spending has outpaced revenue and continues to rise. The country would be in deficit if not for the returns on past savings known as the reserves. Overall spending is projected to hit 19 per cent to 19.5 per cent of gross domestic product on average over the next five years, 1 per cent more than the revenues of today. To bolster fiscal resources, the returns from Temasek Holdings' investments will be included in the Net Investment Returns framework, and the top personal income tax rate will rise from 2017.
Both these revenue measures together are expected to provide for increased spending needs ""till the end of this decade"". The need to spend and invest judiciously will grow in the future.

The ideal location should be nearest the Causeway for easier immigration and Customs control. But it should also connect to Singapore's MRT system for easy connectivity.

","   THERE is consensus that certain aspects of Singapore's Budget indicate a leftward shift politically.
This hinges on the announcement of several things such as a SkillsFuture plan that facilitates workers upgrading their skills, and a Silver Support Scheme which provides cash payouts to Singapore's poorest elderly.
Another key announcement is a plan to reduce income inequality further by increasing taxes on the richest people from 20 per cent to 22 per cent from 2017. (This falls short of what could be the case, for such taxes on the wealthy could almost reach 50 per cent as it is elsewhere. But that's just a personal view, and may be asking for too much, too soon.)
The Budget announcements are much needed, but they do not make Singapore a centre-left state. If anything, it brings the country from centre-right closer towards the centre.
But we should take note of the emphasis by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam that the Budget not only tempers social inequality and also tries to lessen the rich-poor gap, but focuses on social mobility in providing assistance for people to further their potential and earning power. Thus, to frame the Budget as one that should be noted primarily for which political direction it is leaning, is to miss the significance of the announcements.
The introduction of a social safety net which comes in the form of a basic income for some of the poorest in our society marks a morphing from state pragmatism to one that embraces a more ethical dimension into economic planning. Similarly, the SkillsFuture initiative signifies a much needed development from an academic results-oriented meritocracy to the recognition of skills and actual abilities and the need to nurture these.
The Budget announcements should be correctly seen as they have been framed by the Finance Minister: as a shift towards a collective national responsibility for each and every citizen. A change towards a responsible collective mindset for Singapore is crucial. It is not a shift away from self-reliance, but is an acknowledgement that some of us need more help than others and that we should be accountable to one another through socio-economic responsibility. It is in this context that Nominated MP Chia Yong Yong's remarks on Central Provident Fund withdrawals should be understood. Her courageous viewpoint against growing calls for greater flexibility in the withdrawal of the CPF is hardly populist and it has earned her online vilification and misunderstanding. But the point she raised is germane as to how much state intervention is desired by citizens and what personal and overall societal responsibility means.
Strong state intervention in social matters is unlikely in the near future as post-Independence Singapore does not have a far-left tradition. While some may want spending to approximate that of free-spending socialist governments elsewhere, the reality is that Singapore has a constitutional requirement to maintain a balanced budget over a five-year term of government.
It is heartening to see that within the constraints set by prudent fiscal rules, the need for more social spending is increasingly framed as the ""right"" thing to do, and not as an expedient or economically productive thing to do. For example, appeals to the rich to give more to charity and to allow themselves to be taxed more, are made from an ethical viewpoint where each of us is encouraged to take collective responsibility for the whole. The focus is less on what each person can get out of the system, and more on what each can contribute for the betterment of the commonweal.
Collective responsibility cuts both ways. It may entail higher taxes on the wealthy. But it would also put the onus on the rest of us to be responsible in spending, and to ensure that enhanced social spending should be complemented by ensuring, for instance, that CPF withdrawals are used for what they are intended for: retirement funding, not a cash bonus for discretionary expenses.
If we expect a heightened sense of responsibility from the wealthy in being willing to pay higher taxes in future, we must be willing to balance this by maintaining a sense of self-reliance and responsible consumption for ourselves. If this can be realised, then we do not need to wonder how far left we have traversed but look to strengthening as much as possible shared social responsibility as a national vision. This would be the right path for Singapore as it continues its journey into the 21st century.

","   A promised review of the Population White Paper is due before 2020 but in terms of fallout, it need not be deja vu.
IT HAS been two years since the Government released the Population White Paper. Singaporeans would remember the anxiety and angst its projections provoked.
It is understandable to want to avoid revisiting the population debate, especially in the year Singapore celebrates its Golden Jubilee. But this is also a year to ask questions on the country's future, the kind of society that Singaporeans want, and how the city-state can remain a place that citizens are proud to call home.
These questions should drive population policies, which have significant impact on Singaporeans' way of life and quality of life.
In the parliamentary debate in February 2013, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong indicated that the Population White Paper will be reviewed nearer to 2020. This means there are less than five years left to conduct studies or implement and evaluate initiatives to inform the review. And to engage the public.
The review of the White Paper is critical because population policies have many consequences. So, it is timely to reflect on some questions.
How has the Government responded to the reactions to the White Paper? What could have been done better in public communication, and how can it be improved? Can Singapore review its population challenges constructively, in order to tackle them effectively?
Adaptive responses
THE strong negative public emotions experienced and expressed since the release of the Population White Paper did yield much good.
First, the demographic challenges were made clearer in policy deliberations and public discourse.
Second, many deeper issues were raised. Examples include sustainable economic models, urban planning, manpower management, fair employment practices, social mobility, and social cohesion.
Overall, the Government responded swiftly and adaptively to the public reactions and the deeper issues. There were investments in improving infrastructure, economic restructuring, tightening of foreigner inflow, and steps to assist more Singaporeans and raise social mobility.
It is easy to label these responses as populist because of the large expenditures involved.
Indeed, it would have been populist had the policy responses been simply pandering to prevailing public sentiments without regard to their quality and sustainability.
But the citizen-centric actions were also principled - directed at the pain points but guided by meritocracy, fairness, accountability and pragmatism.
For example, the inflow of foreign manpower was tightened by slowing the growth rather than turning off the tap. Housing supply was dramatically ramped up, but housing policies were adapted in stages to calibrate the impact on demand and property prices.
The Fair Consideration Framework ensures citizens are aware of job vacancies and signals the importance of fair employment practices. It does not mandate hiring Singaporeans in ways that go against meritocracy. University places for Singaporeans were increased, but scholarships for foreign students were not done away with.
Rather than labelling them as populist, it is fairer to see post-Population White Paper initiatives as sustained and sustainable principled efforts to develop the Singaporean core.
But it is probably fair to say that the strong reactions to the White Paper had fuelled the urgency and creativity underlying many citizen-centric policies.
Strategic communications
INADEQUATE public communications contributed to part of the negative reactions to the White Paper.
The Government has acknowledged that communications should have begun much earlier - to engage Singaporeans on the demographic challenges. And the importance of Singapore staying open could have been discussed more effectively.
But there is also the issue of strategic communications. This is not about using the right words or framing issues in simple language. It involves judgments on how to integrate public discussions and policy announcements.
Take, for example, the announcement of the Land Use Plan, two days after the release of the Population White Paper.
There were many ideas in the Land Use Plan on optimising land use to support a range of population sizes and ensure a high quality of life. These could have generated discussions on how Singapore can be highly liveable, as both a city and a country. Such discussions did not occur. The debate was fixated at the 6.9 million population figure in the White Paper.
Negative reactions came fast and furious. Several ministers took pains to explain that 6.9 million was the upper limit of a range of population projections by 2030 needed for planning infrastructure, and not a target to achieve.
But confusion continued in public debates. Are the population figures hypothetical situations, plausible possibilities, best- versus worst-case scenarios, planning parameters or population targets? And what do all these terms mean?
Releasing the White Paper prior to the Land Use Plan resulted in a negative outcome. For the public and even Members of Parliament debating the White Paper, the unexpected population projection numbers evoked more than a negative reaction. The numbers activated what behavioural scientists call a prevention focus.
In prevention focus, one's thoughts and feelings are focused on preventing adverse consequences, such as those that easily come to mind when thinking of a large and rapid population growth.
The public attention was fixated on the negative outcomes of population growth. No attention was given to the ideas and opportunities for a good quality of life from optimal land use.
A strategic approach would have, prior to releasing a Population White Paper, presented a draft general development plan for public discussion on land use and liveability.
The plan would focus on ways to ensure a good quality of life in high-density living. This would allow various ideas on land use to receive a fair hearing in terms of constraints, opportunities, innovations and implications.
At the same time, the country's demographic challenges, including issues of local-foreigner relations, could have been raised and honestly discussed at the then ongoing National Conversation.
The Population White Paper would be formulated and refined based on inputs from the public discussions on land use and demographic challenges. The release of the White Paper would occur after the National Conversation exercise, rightly so as an outcome of discussions among Singaporeans.
Such a strategic approach would be respectful of the National Conversation exercise, which was to discuss the kind of society that Singaporeans want and reflect on shared core values such as meritocracy, respect for diversity, and social harmony.
It would also be aligned with citizen-centricity in population priorities. This is the idea that Singaporeans' interests, including their concerns and aspirations, should be the driver of population policy, and not the population numbers.
Challenges, opportunities
IN ADDITION to public communication, policy content can be improved. For example, more attention should be given to the quality of the foreigner inflow, not just the quantity. And too much attention may have been given to the old-age support ratio.
It is important to treat ageing as an asset and not just a liability, with seniors able and willing to contribute economically and socially well beyond the arbitrary cut-off age of 65 years old that represents dependency.
Individuals need to adapt to the environment as they age. But jobs, organisations, urban planning and policies also need to adapt to seniors and the changing population profile. When there is two-way adaptation to changes, ageing can paradoxically increase economic capital and social capital.
So, ageing is part of demographic challenges, but also part of demographic opportunities. The term ""ageing problem"" should be replaced by the term ""ageing issues"".
Moving forward, major changes to population policies will have wide-ranging effects on people and society. Which is why the review of the Population White Paper needs to be honest and genuine, taken seriously, and proceed constructively.
This applies to all parties - politicians, academics, public intellectuals, civil society activists, and anyone advocating a position. No one party has a monopoly on wisdom. And in the light of clear contrary evidence, one should have the intellectual honesty and political courage to revise his position.
Singapore's population policies are not inherently flawed. Many economic and social fundamentals in population matters have been taken care of. But policies can certainly be improved to yield more good.
If a whole-of-society approach is adopted, Singaporeans can be confident that population challenges can be tackled. They will have hope that their goals and aspirations can be achieved, and be optimistic that the future will be better. Resilience develops when they recover from adversity and adapt to changes. This positivity mindset among Singaporeans will build psychological capital in Singapore.
When the Population White Paper is reviewed, the debate should not be deja vu for Singaporeans. It must not be driven by political correctness or populist concerns. Everyone gains from paying attention to policy content, public communication and psychological capital.

","   WITH the death of former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore has lost her most precious son; and the world, a truly outstanding leader.
It would be appropriate to honour this great man with the naming of public institutions, buildings, foundations, and so on, after him.
I suggest renaming Changi Airport the Lee Kuan Yew (or LKY) International Airport.
With this renaming, millions of visitors each year can see for themselves what our founding father achieved for Singapore.
One of his greatest contributions was to have initiated, led and evolved a unique system of governance based on integrity, meritocracy, pragmatism, commitment, consistency, perseverance, secularism, multiracialism, order and law, plus a self-renewal mechanism that ensures continuous quality leadership and economic success.
Mr Lee is widely respected as ""the strategist's strategist, the leader's leader and the mentor's mentor"".
Every Singaporean and resident, whatever his age, status in society, or political inclination, can honour and show respect and love for Mr Lee by letting the Lee Kuan Yew spirit live through him.
Let us teach our children and future generations to practise the principles he adopted, including lifelong learning, in leading the nation and in his life.
As for leaders among us, it would be worthwhile to practise his three most important ""helicopter qualities"": powers of analysis; logical grasp of facts; and concentrating on the basic points, and extracting the principles.
And, as he put it: ""You must be able to soar above reality and say, 'This is also possible' - a sense of imagination.""
With current and future generations of Singaporeans leading lives with the Lee Kuan Yew spirit in them, the tenacity and vision of Mr Lee will come alive, as he himself said in 1965: ""I am calculating in terms of the next generation; in terms of the next 100 years; in terms of eternity; and believe you me, for the next thousand years, we will be here.""
I thank Mr Lee for soaring above reality and outperforming a seemingly impossible goal, and transforming Singapore into the miracle nation it is today.

'FATHER' TO A CANADIAN, TOO
I am Canadian but I am crying too, over the death of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He was my father too, because my wife was healed and my children were conceived in this wonderful city of Singapore - a city created through his lifetime of work and vision. He is my role model and my hero, a man of wisdom and kindness. He will be missed.

KEY DATES AS PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
Singapore has lost its founding father, and the world a great man. Mr Lee Kuan Yew sacrificed so much for our country, and we are filled with unimaginable grief. We should set aside March 23 (the date of his death), and Sept 16 (the date of his birth) as public holidays to honour him.
- Siow Tian Rui
STAND UP FOR WHAT HE STOOD FOR
Singaporeans have awakened to a Singapore without Mr Lee Kuan Yew. It is indeed the end of an era. As a Singaporean from a minority ethnic group, I am indebted to our senior statesman for giving everyone a place under the sun. It is now also time for all Singaporeans to stand up for what Mr Lee stood for all throughout his political career - meritocracy, multiracialism and the rule of law.

PERMANENT REMINDERS OF MR LEE'S CONTRIBUTIONS
As we mourn the death of a great leader, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, I appeal to the Government to consider, first, having a bronze bust of Mr Lee placed at a prominent location at Parliament House for public viewing, and, second, having his image printed on our currency notes.
These will permanently remind all Singaporeans of the man who shaped Singapore to what it is today.

STORY OF A MAN THAT BEARS RETELLING
My son, who is 1-1/2, and unborn daughter will grow up in a Singapore without Mr Lee Kuan Yew. They will not know and remember him as I have. But I want them to. I want them to remember Mr Lee not because of his great achievements, but for the principles he stood for: honesty and being upright, hard work, perseverance and sacrifice. I will tell them his story so they will grow up practising these principles and tell it to their own children.

","   SINGAPORE'S current generation of leaders urged Singaporeans to honour Mr Lee Kuan Yew by keeping the country united, and successful.
Building on what Mr Lee and his team put in place - especially upholding the values of multiracialism, meritocracy, incorruptibility and bold policymaking - would be the best way to keep his legacy alive, they said.
""Everything that is Lee Kuan Yew is what will hold us well for the future. Especially the way he kept looking to the future, looking for new opportunities, spotting problems before they arrive, preparing Singaporeans well,"" said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.
""That is what we've got to keep doing. That is the way we honour Mr Lee's legacy.""
Mr Tharman was speaking to reporters after attending Mr Lee's private family wake yesterday at Sri Temasek, the Prime Minister's official residence.
Cabinet ministers and MPs were among the 1,200 people in attendance.
Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim said Mr Lee ""went out of his way"" to apply the two principles of meritocracy and multiracialism to all communities in Singapore.
""We have to continue that story... if not, we have nowhere else to go,"" said Dr Yaacob. ""That is the thing that we must learn from him and we want to keep that alive, especially for the younger generation. Because without that, it is going to be a difficult journey for us.""
Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said: ""This is the time for Singaporeans to come together, united, in mourning... But I hope also, united in our collective determination to further his legacy of building a more dynamic and prosperous Singapore.""
When most of Singapore's current leaders entered politics, Mr Lee was already well into his 70s.
But they described his probing presence and sharp questioning as having shaped and inspired them as politicians and policymakers.
""I had many debates with him about Islam and Muslims in Singapore,"" recalled Dr Yaacob. ""Many occasions, he would call me in the middle of the night to clarify something on Islam and Muslims. And I would have to discuss and debate with him, and sometimes he would change his view.""
Noting that this is a mark of a great man, he added: ""He understood what needed to be done and if he understood that the other point of view was better, he is prepared to cede the ground...He just wanted to find the best solution. We learnt a lot from him.""
Law and Foreign Minister K. Shanmugam said: ""Whether it was policy, whether it was the ability to strategically see the long term, whether it was legal analysis, he was on top of it all.""
He added: ""It was wonderful to work with him. You had to be honest and if you didn't know, you had to tell him you didn't know. He appreciated the honesty. But he always expected you to have done your homework.""
Said Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, holding back tears: ""Mr Lee was like a father to all of us. Today's Singapore was his life's work and a gift to all of us.""

",191,NA," Mar 24, 2015

"," The Straits Times; Singapore
",NA,"   LEE KUAN YEW was many things to Singaporeans: father figure, visionary, social disciplinarian and sage.
He was the man who played the decisive role in the creation of Singapore as the people know it today. ""One day, this will be a metropolis. Never fear!"" he once declared. The people believed in him, gave him and the nation's other founding fathers their support, and together they built modern Singapore.
He was astute enough to have surrounded himself with men of conviction who shared his vision. The original team of Goh Keng Swee, Toh Chin Chye, S. Rajaratnam, Lim Kim San, Hon Sui Sen and E.W. Barker were all titans in their own right.
But as the skipper, Mr Lee gained much of the credit for the successes that were to come. He was the doer-in-chief who outlined the plans, crystallised thoughts, marshalled the talents, swayed the voters, and got things done. Singaporeans owe more than they can imagine to Mr Lee and his group of stout-hearted patriots.
He has died at the advanced age of 91, having soldiered on right to the end. He had seemed sad and somewhat withdrawn after the death of his wife, a soulmate and confidante he was devoted to. But for the better part of his post-leadership years - after giving up the prime ministership when he was at the peak of his powers - he had the satisfaction of seeing the results of a lifetime of dedication and toil. He has gone out a man fulfilled, confident in the knowledge that Singapore as an idea he crafted can endure.
Tears will still be shed at the death of a remarkable achiever and a patriot, but he would certainly not be impressed if Singaporeans became mawkish on his behalf. He was not a sentimental man, only one who was passionate about his belief in Singapore.
The Singapore of today, standing 10 feet tall despite its slight base, is a monument to Mr Lee's daring, his leadership and his capacity for self-belief. It was he who made Singapore known to the world as a byword for sensible, pragmatic governance.
What he was not was a dreamer. He was not one for grandiose speeches, elegant theories or overly intellectual discourse. His guiding philosophy, as he said often, was simply to do ""what works"". By almost every Singaporean's reckoning, his legacy will be this: the Singapore he led in building will endure after him.
In moments of musing, he used to say this was not yet a nation. The roots were as yet shallow, the moorings not quite firm. He was an exacting man, always worrying about the possible perils and pitfalls ahead, and seeking ways to avoid them. The values he left behind - meritocracy, racial and religious tolerance, integrity in public life, respect for the rule of law - will help secure Singapore's longevity.
Some of the self-proclaimed ""knuckle-duster"" methods he used to clear obstacles in his path and to counter critics - methods he said he had learnt through life-and-death struggles with communist and communalist opponents who did not believe in Queensberry rules - might be judged by some as harsh. They left even some of his admirers cold. Rightly or wrongly, he always acted in the firm belief that the fledgling nation's cause needed protecting from those whose agendas he was convinced would harm Singapore.
This tough-minded approach helped him to deliver results and improved the people's lives, thereby winning their support, respect and trust. But by the 1980s, changing times required a different approach, which he recognised and urged on his younger colleagues. His successors will have to keep pace with this evolving political landscape if they are to enjoy the same high levels of esteem and support that the people had for the first-generation PAP Government led by Mr Lee.
That there is a Singapore - secure, successful and always seeking new ways to stay relevant in an unforgiving, changing world - is Mr Lee's legacy. He would often assert that Singapore was no ordinary country. To overcome the odds and survive, this city-state and disparate society had to be ""special"", even ""extraordinary"".
Singaporeans can pay him no more fitting tribute than to strive to ensure it stays that way.

",NA,"   SCHOOLS that Mr Lee Kuan Yew once attended mourned his death with special assemblies yesterday.
In the school halls of Raffles Institution (RI) and Telok Kurau Primary School, Mr Lee's alma maters, the principals shared their thoughts on Singapore's first Prime Minister.
Telok Kurau Primary's principal, Ms Charis Wong, credited Mr Lee for Singapore's transformation into a global city in decades. Addressing hundreds of pupils, she added: ""He was a loving husband to his wife and a loving father too.""
Since yesterday, the pupils have been penning condolence messages on heart-shaped cards.
They also folded flowers, which will be collected into bouquets.
These will be presented by staff and student representatives when they pay their last respects at Parliament House later this week.
Library resources and reading materials on Mr Lee will be used as part of lessons this week.
""Our pupils have always known Mr Lee as one of our alumni and are proud to be in a school where Mr Lee was once a student,"" Ms Wong said.
Mr Lee enrolled in the school in 1930. It still keeps an old class attendance book with the words ""Lee Harry"" in its heritage room.
Mr Lee was not only a statesman. Policies he mooted made an impact on Ms Wong's life.
Choking back tears, she said: ""I didn't grow up in a well-to-do family, but Singapore's system of meritocracy gave me opportunities and brought me to where I am today.""
At RI, which Mr Lee attended from 1936 to 1940, students remembered him as a man of conviction, who always had the country's best interests at heart.
Rafflesian Arif Jabbar, 15, said: ""Not all his policies were popular, but whatever he did, he believed (in it). He had the best intentions for Singapore at heart.
""It's his determination that I will remember him for.""
Said RI principal Chan Poh Meng: ""He dedicated his life to building a cohesive society where Singaporeans can pursue justice, peace, progress and equality.
""He was a leader and among the core group of founding fathers who were pivotal in charting the course of our nation's history.
""His passing is a deep loss to all of us.""
All schools flew the national flag at half-mast across the island yesterday.
They also observed a minute's silence for Mr Lee.

","   FROM Washington to Canberra, the world mourned the death of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, described as one of ""the greatest leaders"" of our times, a ""lion among leaders"" and an ""inspiration"" to Asians.
""Lee Kuan Yew was a legendary figure in Asia, widely respected for his strong leadership and statesmanship,"" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon said in a statement, leading the reaction of world leaders.
""As Singapore marks its 50th anniversary of independence this year, its founding father will be remembered as one of the most inspiring Asian leaders.""
Leaders in the world's most powerful nation also expressed grief at Mr Lee's death, with past and present US presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama issuing condolence notes.
""He was a true giant of history who will be remembered for generations to come as the father of modern Singapore and as one of the great strategists of Asian affairs,"" Mr Obama said in tribute, as he expressed resounding appreciation for the Singapore statesman whose voice continued to be heard long after he stepped down as Prime Minister in 1990.
""Our discussions during my trip to Singapore in 2009 were hugely important in helping me formulate our policy of rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific,"" he said.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank also joined in saluting the departed Singapore leader, who famously took his nation from Third World to First World during his lifetime.
""He was a visionary statesman whose uncompromising stand for meritocracy, efficiency and education transformed Singapore into one of the most prosperous nations in the world,"" IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said in Washington.
The World Bank praised Mr Lee for transforming Singapore.
""He tackled corruption relentlessly and held public servants to the highest standards,"" said the World Bank's chief executive officer, Mr Jim Yong Kim. ""More importantly, he showed that economic development could provide opportunities and improve the lives of a country's citizens.""
Mr Lee, who was the last surviving of the Asian titans who brought independence from European colonial rule to their nations, was also one of the five founding leaders of Asean, along with those from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.
Yesterday, South-east Asian leaders stood as one to express appreciation for a personality whose vision and diplomacy helped provide stability for a region that emerged as a growth model for the world during his time.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, whose nation is Asean's largest by area and economic size, described Mr Lee as a close friend of Indonesia and said he would travel to the Republic for Mr Lee's funeral.
""As a leader and a great statesman who loved his people, he was also one of the most influential politicians in Asia,"" Mr Joko told reporters in Tokyo, where he is on a bilateral visit.
In Malaysia, Prime Minister Najib Razak wrote on Facebook that ""founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew's achievements were great, and his legacy is assured"".
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Johor Sultan's coronation later, he said Mr Lee had the ability to contribute concrete ideas in various fields.
Datuk Seri Najib said he did not think Mr Lee's death would impact bilateral ties because current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is committed to strengthening the bilateral relationship.
Thailand's royal family and leaders also sent their condolences yesterday. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha will be in Singapore for Mr Lee's funeral on Sunday.
Much of the region's early prosperity is often linked to investments from Japan in the 1970s and 1980s.
Called the ""flying geese model"", this had Japan as lead goose, with newly industrialising South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore close behind, followed by the developing economies of Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.
Yesterday, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Mr Lee, who is ""revered all over the world"", played a key role not only in achieving Singapore's remarkable economic growth and prosperity but also in securing the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and the world.
Mr Lee was ""one of the greatest leaders of modern times that Asia has ever produced"", he said.
In China and India, Asia's big tectonic plates where Mr Lee was familiar to every leader in their modern history, the tributes were fulsome as well.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said Mr Lee had been widely respected by the international community as a strategist and statesman and called him ""founder, pioneer and promoter of China-Singapore relations"".
In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the tributes to the Singaporean figure.
""A far-sighted statesman and a lion among leaders, Mr Lee Kuan Yew's life teaches valuable lessons to everyone,"" tweeted Mr Modi, who uses the social media site for most of his public pronouncements.

RESPECT OF FILIPINOS
""An era has passed, one upon which Singaporeans can look back on with deep pride and a sense of accomplishment. Throughout his long life, as Prime Minister and Senior Minister, Mr Lee demonstrated an unswerving devotion to his country, turning it into a statement that would be an exemplar of efficient, modern and honest governance. The development of Singapore has earned it the respect of nations and peoples, including the tens of thousands of Filipinos who work there and visit the country.""

DETERMINATION TO SUCCEED
""Lee Kuan Yew's courage, determination, commitment, character and ability made him a formidable leader who held the respect of Singaporeans and the international community alike. His loss will be deeply felt by his family and the people of Singapore. I had the honour of meeting Mr Lee in 2007 during his last official visit to New Zealand. He was well-known for his insights and foresight but what struck me most was his unwavering determination to see Singapore succeed.""

A FRIEND TO BRITAIN
""He was always a friend to Britain, if sometimes a critical one, and many British prime ministers benefited from his wise advice, including me.""
- British Prime Minister David Cameron
BIG INFLUENCE IN ASIA
""There can be few examples in history of such an outstandingly successful nation created so completely by the vision, will and leadership of a single individual.
""But his achievement extended far beyond Singapore itself. He was a key architect of Asean, and through that made a central contribution to the emergence of South-east Asia as a model to the world of effective regional cooperation and integration. No one did more than Lee to make our nearer region as stable and harmonious as it is today.
""But perhaps even more importantly, Lee had a profound impact on the wider Asian region through his remarkable influence on China. He understood, perhaps before anyone else outside China, and perhaps even before Deng Xiaoping himself, just what China could achieve if it found a way to harness market economics and an open trading and investment regime.""

","   A MAN who kept his promises, played a key role in making Singapore clean and green and was a loving husband.
Some 1,300 pupils from Telok Kurau Primary, aged seven to 12, were taught about Mr Lee Kuan Yew's legacy during an hour-long slide show yesterday.
Teachers from the school - Mr Lee's alma mater - impressed upon pupils the influence of the former Prime Minister.
They recounted, for instance, how he delivered on his bold promises - such as in 1961, when a fire swept through Bukit Ho Swee and he promised distraught residents new flats to live in within nine months. Together with his team, he made it happen.
""He was a man of his word,"" said Madam Marliana Rashid, 32, national education coordinator at the school, who delivered the slide show on Mr Lee's life.
Pupils were also told how Mr Lee played a key role in all aspects of the country's development, from housing to economics to defence policies.
Principals at schools across the nation delivered speeches about Singapore's founding father at assemblies yesterday, drawing on a note Education Minister Heng Swee Keat had posted on Facebook.
Mrs Charis Wong, principal of Telok Kurau Primary, said: ""People often say Lee Kuan Yew has four children. The fourth was Singapore and he was always speaking about her, thinking about her.""
The pupils read out tributes to Mr Lee that they had written on heart-shaped cards. Others folded origami flowers, which will be gathered into bouquets and delivered to Parliament House when the school community pay their last respects there.
On Sunday, Primary Six pupil Lim Yu Li, 12, wanted to travel to Singapore General Hospital to place a card at the well-wishers' corner, but her uncle's car broke down en route. ""I just want to thank Mr Lee - he did not give up on the dream of Singapore,"" she said.
At Raffles Institution, Mr Lee's other alma mater, the mood was sombre. ""I am grateful to Mr Lee for emphasising meritocracy... so that we all have the chance to make a living for ourselves,"" RI student Rachel Koh, 17, said.
Mr Lee studied at RI from 1936 to 1940, but was never quite the model student, with his ""mischievous, playful streak"". As a student, he was always a late riser, ""an owl, more than a lark"", he wrote in his memoirs. When he was late for a third time in a term in 1938, then-headmaster D.W. McLeod gave him ""three of the best with his trousers on"", Mr Lee added.
Student Isaac Leong, 17, felt such anecdotes made Mr Lee, the politician and towering statesman, more relatable. ""Still, it takes a special person to achieve what he did,"" he said.
At Crest Secondary, which specialises in the Normal (Technical) curriculum, 14-year-old Daniel Ismadir said: ""He and his team cleaned up the Singapore River, Without him, we would not have the clean and green city that we do now.""
Flags in all schools are flying at half-mast. Many also observed a minute of silence yesterday.

","   THE political system former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew built during his time was a British parliamentary system in form but truly a Confucian order in substance.
In Confucian ideals, the benevolent leader (emperor) is wise and compassionate and possesses the mandate of heaven (overwhelming popular vote).
The people are highly respectful of their leaders, single-minded in their common purpose and deeply loyal to their nation.
The state is administered by an efficient and educated class of mandarins based on meritocracy and incorruptibility.
There is a merchant class that is prosperous and a peasant class, which is harmonious.
Peace and order (lack of chaos) are the foundation of prosperity and progress.
These were ideals for ancient China, and proven in modern Singapore.
Viewed through Western media and its prescribed ""universal"" moral standards of governance, Mr Lee and his system have often been unfairly portrayed as oppressive, dictatorial and draconian.
In the East, this is wise, compassionate but strict leadership in the best of Confucian traditions.
In an imperfect world of compromises, many of us with Asian roots would value peace and security above freedom of speech and freedom of the press; economic empowerment before political liberation; and country, community and family before self.
Stop judging Singapore and our founding father by Western ideals (of liberal democracy, absolute freedom of speech, and so on) and you will start to appreciate what we really are and the archetypical benevolent leader that Mr Lee truly was.
As Mr Lee once said, he is answerable to no one, except the then two million lives at stake under his watch.
He did not seek to be popular or loved, but merely to serve his comrades to the best of his ability and up to his last breath.
A loving father who cared enough to be strict with his children, so we may grow up to be hard-working and disciplined, well conditioned to succeed and in harmony.
He knew that unlike large countries, we had no endowments to depend on and would, by default, starve to death if we did not have the will, unity and ability to succeed.
Tough love from a caring father - that is the founding father of Singapore that I know, love and revere for eternity.

"," Opinion
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
",NA,"   AMONG the reflections on the death of Singapore's founding Prime Minister is an ""end of an era"" theme that posits both that there will never be another Lee Kuan Yew and that leaders of his ilk are unlikely to be seen again.
All these are unique: Mr Lee's extraordinary personal attributes, the circumstances that shaped his character and beliefs, and his lifetime achievement - great in and of itself and also because of the odds stacked against him - and his abiding devotion to his singular cause: Singapore.
Mr Lee remained at the helm for 31 years, which is rare in a democratic polity. Even after stepping down, ""he put every waking moment into making Singapore successful"", as Education Minister Heng Swee Keat noted.
Singaporeans would hope that the single-minded pursuit of public service as a lifelong calling, and the laser-like focus on what is in the best, long-term interest of Singapore, which Mr Lee
exemplified, will remain alive in Singapore, across the political spectrum, for a long time to come.
Unswerving commitment to fundamental principles and a willingness to stay on track over the long haul are all the more relevant in a modern polity, given that attention spans, news and electoral cycles all seem to be getting shorter these days. After all, countries are likely to face setbacks from time to time - for example, when the economic cycles beyond our control work against us or events conspire to turn the public mood, with longer-term issues being set aside for more immediate concerns.
Mr Lee never flinched from tackling heart and mind issues - reflected in the ideological struggle against the communists, conflict of foundational principles during the days of merger with Malaysia, and bid to ensure ""everybody will have his place: equal; language, culture, religion"", as he put it 50 years ago. His convictions ran through his veins.
Some have questioned the present relevance of ""conviction politicians"" in an age of shifting attitudes and swing voters, swayed by sound bites and social media. Of course, leadership styles everywhere are bound to change with the times to suit the make-up and mood of the people. Besides, as Mr Lee himself often asserted, ""policies are not meant to be cast in stone"".
Yet, whatever may come, many would hope that Singapore always stays firm in its convictions and beliefs in the founding ideals that Mr Lee championed and lived by: multiracialism, meritocracy, good governance, zero tolerance for corruption, a belief in education, hard work, discipline and self-reliance. While the job of governing Singapore will no doubt grow more complex, and even contentious, in the years to come, most would agree that fractious politics leading to political paralysis would be ruinous for the nation.

",NA,"   PROFESSOR Kishore Mahbubani's comment on the challenge for Singapore has provided some perspectives on what has made this country what it is today (""S'pore's challenge: 'Be confident while being paranoid'""; March 17).
However, it is fundamentally our national culture that has brought Singapore to where it is now, and our future will again depend on whether, as a country and people, we will continue to embrace it.
Our national culture was forged by the first generation of leaders.
By force of personality, former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was able to influence his team of able people and the population to share a culture of upholding the values of meritocracy, racial and religious harmony, diligence, thrift and innovation.
This national culture characterised Singapore, and the resulting shared values, beliefs and principles, and behaviour of the Government and population enabled the country to overcome various crises of growth and survival, and steered Singapore to where it stands today.
My hope for Singapore is that this national culture will prevail, now that Mr Lee is no longer with us, as it would give the nation a better chance of survival in the future.

","   AT A South Asian diaspora convention in Singapore in 2011, when Mr Lee Kuan Yew was asked if he could replicate Singapore's success in India, he laughed out loud, but his answer was clear: No.
""No single person can change India,"" he responded. ""If you compare with China, 90 per cent speak one language. It is a much easier country to lead than India. India consists of many different nation groups and dialects.""
He had many observations about India, some flattering and several not so flattering.
He called India a ""nation of unfulfilled greatness"" with its potential ""lain fallow, under-used"".
India's complex caste system was an ""enemy of meritocracy"", he said. The potential of the country was bogged down by a bureaucracy ""wrapped in a colonial mindset"".
In one interview, he said India was ""not a real country"" but ""32 separate nations"".
Yet, even for Indians who did not agree with many of his views on India, he represented how a strong leader could make a difference to a nation.
Said Dr Sanjaya Baru, who served as media adviser to former Indian premier Manmohan Singh and later taught at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy: ""I think most middle-class Indians who visited Singapore would envy Singapore's success and would wish India had a leader like him.
""The fact is that, in the past, Lee Kuan Yew did have a high regard for India and did reach out to India. I think, towards the end, he had become quite critical.
""I think all of us admired the kind of energy that he sustained in leadership and created something unique. But you can't do it anywhere else except Singapore. In that sense, it is unique.""
Strategic affairs analyst C. Uday Bhaskar, who as a young naval officer visited Singapore often in the 1970s, said he was struck by the transformation he saw in the nation under Mr Lee.
""He will be remembered as the great architect of Singapore. It is very impressive what he has done, though he has been accused of ruling with an iron fist. But he was able to infuse an identity of Singapore in spite of a very complex ethnic diversity,"" said Mr Bhaskar.
He feels that the way Mr Lee navigated through complex relationships with neighbours such as Malaysia and other countries in Asean also holds a lesson for India.
India operates in a difficult neighbourhood, and it has gone to war thrice with Pakistan and once with China.
""There is a certain amount of pragmatism and how to maximise fairly difficult geopolitical and geostrategic circumstances,"" said Mr Bhaskar.
Mr Lee knew India quite well. He first visited the country in 1959 for a conference of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ). As Prime Minister of independent Singapore, he visited six times. He returned in 2005 to deliver the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Lecture in New Delhi and for later visits.
As early as in 1966, he suggested during a visit that India should take a leadership role in South-east Asia. He even proposed that India and Japan should start a regional economic cooperation accord. He knew many Indian leaders personally and most of its prime ministers, from India's first Premier Jawaharlal Nehru to Dr Manmohan Singh.
In later years, Mr Lee also became somewhat of a mentor to various Indian leaders.
Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Nehru's great-grandson, spent a week in Singapore at Mr Lee's invitation and had meetings with him.
Dr Baru revealed that, at one meeting between Mr Lee and Dr Singh, the latter sought advice on how to handle the Chinese leadership.
Many saw Mr Lee's contribution in recognising early that India could play a role in South-east Asia and as a counterweight to China.
Some even liked his plain speaking about India, seeing that as a desire for India to do better.
""Lee Kuan Yew was candid about India in his own characteristic way, and hoped we would rise to our real potential. Some of his views regarding our nationhood might be disagreed with but, overall, his heart was in India, and he genuinely wanted us to achieve our real potential,"" said Mr Tarun Vijay, an MP of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
India's current Prime Minister, Mr Narendra Modi, who will attend Mr Lee's funeral on Sunday, is known to be an admirer of Mr Lee and Singapore's model of development.
In the past year, Mr Modi has focused on areas such as cleanliness, promoting manufacturing and reducing red tape - issues that Mr Lee had highlighted over the years.

","   Dignitaries singled out Singapore's corruption-free society, education system and the Government's succession planning for praise yesterday, saying these were the legacies of founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
They were speaking to reporters at Parliament House, after paying their respects to Mr Lee yesterday, the last day of the lying in state.
Mr Lee, 91, died last Monday at the Singapore General Hospital, after 47 days in intensive care.
Yesterday, former Indonesian general Prabowo Subianto said Mr Lee had left behind a country that would thrive even without him.
""His greatest legacy... was creating a system that had succeeded in creating a meritocracy, and in grooming two, three generations of good leaders. So that's his great legacy, and Singapore will thrive with what he had achieved,"" he said.
Mr Prabowo was replying to questions from Indonesian journalists, who had asked if Singapore would survive without Mr Lee.
He was also asked about Singapore-Indonesia relations.
He said he was confident nothing would change. He and the other Indonesian leaders were all acquainted with the current generation of Singapore leaders so ""there's nothing to worry about"".
He added: ""I admire Mr Lee Kuan Yew and I think he was a great leader of South-east Asia. He was a good friend of Indonesia, he was a tough leader, and I think that we have a lot to learn from his leadership style and from his thinking.""
Afghanistan's Deputy Foreign Minister Hekmat Karzai, who was also at Parliament House, said: ""A country like Afghanistan which has gone through so much conflict and (faces) a lot of the problems... there are so many lessons Afghanistan can take from his vision, his ideas.""
Quoting from Mr Lee's books, he said Singapore's first Prime Minister had brought Singapore from Third World to First in 50 years, and Afghanistan could try to ""reach similar success"", through learning from Singapore's and Mr Lee's experiences.
The most important lesson for him, he said, is the need to stamp out corruption.
""He created a society, a country, that is corruption-free. And corruption is a problem that is a major issue for the people and the government, and... the mechanism that he established, the initiative that he embarked on, is something we can truly benefit from,"" he added.
National University of Singapore president Tan Chorh Chuan, who was part of a vigil group at Mr Lee's lying in state yesterday, paid tribute to his contributions to education and talent development.
Mr Lee believed that every student should be given a chance to develop to his full potential, including the personal aspect, he said.
""Over time he's spoken about character, resilience, ability to overcome. It's shaped the thinking and culture of our educational institutions,"" Professor Tan said.
Other dignitaries who paid their respects were former US president Bill Clinton, former US national security adviser Tom Donilon, former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, former US ambassador to Singapore Steven Green, former Taiwanese leader Hau Pei-tsun, former Malaysian finance minister Daim Zainuddin, Bhutanese King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, Philippines Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario and Philippines Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima, and former Indonesian coordinating minister for People's Welfare Agung Laksono.
The list also includes Mr Jack Ma, head of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, Professor Pieter Winsemius and Mrs Aeyelts Averink Winsemius - children of the late Dr Albert Winsemius who was economic adviser to Singapore for about 20 years.

","   Growing up, Mr Tan Tong Hai and his five siblings lived in a one-room rental flat in Redhill with their parents.
The home was bare, furnished with just a table and some chairs. They could not afford a TV set.
A typical meal was rice with black soya sauce. His clothes and school books were hand-me- downs from a neighbour or his brother.
The 1960s was a tumultuous period in Singapore history, with a weak economy, very high unemployment and widespread poverty.
Mr Tan remembers his mother, an illiterate, regularly exhorting her six children: ""Study hard and be successful. Don't let people look down on you.""
Now aged 51, he is the chief executive of StarHub. His home? A landed property in the high-end Holland Road area.
Mr Tan credits his success story to the ""solid foundation"" provided by Singapore's education system.
""I was one of the beneficiaries of the system, which lifted me from poverty to where I am today,"" he said.
The emphasis the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew placed on education is legendary as the Government saw it as pivotal in creating a quality workforce to grow the country's economy and improve people's lives.
Mr Tan's parents sent all their six children to Tiong Bahru Primary School.
Though school fees were ""affordable"", he said, his late father's earnings as a cabby were not enough to buy new school textbooks, uniforms and shoes for all his children.
At the start of every school year, he had to borrow money.
""For the rest of the year, my father would slog to pay the debt, only to start the process all over again in January the following year.""
In 1976, Mr Tan started Secondary 1 in Gan Eng Seng School because ""I could use my older brother's uniform and books"".
He did well and got into Hwa Chong Junior College.
With government bursaries and scholarships available for bright children from low-income families, ""I was even more motivated to study hard"", he said.
Like many in his generation, he could also turn to community groups, unions and business organisations for study grants.
Mr Tan received his first scholarship in 1980, when he was in his first year at Hwa Chong.
It came from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
He subsequently received financial aid every year until he completed his four-year electrical engineering degree at the National University of Singapore.
His first job was at multinational IBM, as a software engineer, and with his first pay, he helped his parents buy an HDB flat in Bishan in 1989. The entire family moved into the four-room flat.
It has since been sold and his mother, now 80, lives with one of his siblings.
Mr Tan credits his achievements to Singapore's meritocratic education system.
He wants his 19-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son to enter a local university - just as he did - though fees are no longer an issue.

","   They expected him to fail. But 50 years later, while we remember the man Harry Lee Kuan Yew, who transformed Singapore from a British colonial outpost into a prosperous, global city-state, we must not overlook some of his key lessons in leadership.
After separation from Malaysia, the future of Singapore looked bleak. Mr Lee inherited a toxic mix of racial unrest, an unemployment rate of 30 per cent, domestic instability and economic uncertainty. Singapore could have followed the path of some of its neighbours: increasing nationalist rhetoric, racial division, economic instability, communist insurgency and continued unrest. Mr Lee could have followed the path of Mr Sukarno, Mr Ferdinand Marcos or even Mr Ngo Dinh Diem.
Mr Lee concluded otherwise.
He fundamentally understood that people are everything. Long before the era of corporate strategists, new-age gurus, or smooth-talking politicos, he saw that the development of the people of Singapore - its core natural resource - was the key to long-term economic growth, social development and national prosperity.
It helped that Singapore was located in one of the key global maritime choke points, but its long-term ability to seize such opportunities rested on the skills of its labour force and ambition of its nascent middle class. Mr Lee and his ministers carried it out by following three general principles.
See people, not racial groups
Mr Lee respected racial identity but would not be intimidated by it. He acknowledged race as a dimension of one's identity but sought to secure Singapore's national identity as a multiracial society. He combated racism by addressing access to education, employment and social integration as key planks in building a cohesive nation composed of multiple races, ethnicities and religions. The commitment to meritocracy and a commitment to addressing the underlying economic and social challenges remain as consistent parts of Singapore's approach towards maintaining a cohesive society.
Invest in people, not axioms
Mr Lee based his entire economic development plan on a simple question: Does it work? If something worked, it was continued or improved upon. If something failed, it was scrapped and a new idea was employed. As such, he invested in infrastructure and national institutions, ranging from building Changi International Airport and the world's largest container port to establishing the Biopolis and Fusionopolis parks, and the research hubs at the National University of Singapore.
In turn, Singapore maintained itself as a free port city while running one of the most highly successful publicly owned airlines in the world. Home ownership soared and led to the stability of Singapore's middle class through the sale of public housing to new families. Corruption was met head-on through a combination of tough penalties and highly competitive salaries for the civil service.
Government and corporate scholarships cemented a growing, well-educated middle class. Mr Lee was neither a neo-liberal nor a socialist; he was a pragmatist. He embraced ideas to the extent that such ideas yielded positive results.
Lead people from the front, don't follow them from behind
Mr Lee was fundamentally shaped by the brutality of the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. For Mr Lee, politics was about ensuring the survival of his country - his home and family - in an uncertain world. Simply put: You adapt or become irrelevant.
He chose his battles wisely, but once chosen, he broke his opponents before they could break him. He ordered mass arrests to combat a nascent communist insurgency. He established universal military training for all males after independence. And he pursued tough and invasive policies in transforming the personal habits of his own people in order to transform Singapore into a ""First World nation in a Third World region"".
Even in his final years, he tackled controversial subjects such as family planning, immigration and population growth.
The final chapter on Mr Lee Kuan Yew's legacy will remain unwritten for some time. It is complex and controversial.
But whatever it may be, the fact remains that his leadership has significantly and substantially improved the lives of the people of Singapore and, along the way, inspired other national leaders to do the same for their own people. And that is a legacy worth remembering.

","   PRIME Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday called on Singaporeans to continue Mr Lee Kuan Yew's life's work by making this island nation a great metropolis that reflects the ideals of their founding prime minister.
In a 40-minute eulogy, delivered in English, Mandarin and Malay, he spoke of the late Mr Lee's commitment to multiracialism, equality, meritocracy, integrity and rule of law; celebrated his ferocious fighting spirit and described his decades-long effort to prepare Singapore to continue beyond him.
Not only had he systematically identified and groomed a team of successors, but he also continued writing books into his 90s so that a new generation could learn from his experience, and understand what their security, prosperity and future depended on. ""His biggest worry was that younger Singaporeans would lose the instinct for what made Singapore tick,"" PM Lee said.
He cited three recent books, the first on bilingualism, the second entitled Hard Truths and a third - One Man's View Of The World. The first two were launched in 2011 and the third in 2013.
PM Lee spoke of a man who fought and laboured tirelessly for his beliefs and the country he loved. In the 1960s, he battled communists and communalists, putting his own life on the line. Later, he fought for Singapore's survival after separation from Malaysia and when the British forces withdrew, taking 150,000 jobs with them.
""Just weeks after Separation, he boldly declared that '10 years from now, this will be a metropolis. Never fear!' And indeed he made it happen. He instilled discipline and order - ensuring that in Singapore, every problem gets fixed,"" PM Lee said.
He also enabled his economic team of Old Guard ministers Goh Keng Swee, Hon Sui Sen and Lim Kim San to design and carry out their plans to attract investments and grow the economy. ""As he said, ""I settled the political conditions so that tough policies... could be executed.""
PM Lee added that ""because people knew that he cared for them and not for himself, and because he had faith that Singaporeans would work with him to achieve great things, Mr Lee won the trust and confidence of Singaporeans"".
In both his eulogy at the state funeral service in the University Cultural Centre (UCC), and later at a private ceremony for family and friends at Mandai Crematorium, PM Lee shared personal memories of his father, including a conversation they had years ago over a golf game in which the elder Mr Lee told his oldest child to take care of his mother and younger brother and sister should anything happen to him.
Their father, he said, had already plunged deep into politics when the children arrived so their mother brought them up. ""But Pa set the tone, tracked our progress and made the big decisions. He sent us to a Chinese school; he started us on Malay lessons with Cikgu Amin; he encouraged Yang and me to take up SAF Scholarships, to serve the nation.""
His father was there when he learnt to ride a bicycle, helped take care of his young children when his first wife died, and worried about his nutrition when he was undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma.
His father's death ""will leave a big hole"" in the hearts of family and friends, ""but his values, his love, and his words - these will stay with us, inspire us and live on in us for a long, long time"".
As for Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew intended nothing less than to see that it ""will be here a thousand years from now"". With him gone, it is the duty of those who remain to continue his life's work, PM Lee said.
He ended his eulogy with this rallying call to Singaporeans: ""We come together to pledge ourselves to continue building this exceptional country. Let us shape this island nation into one of the great cities in the world reflecting the ideals he stood for, realising the dreams he inspired and worthy of the people who have made Singapore our home and nation.""

","   I DISAGREE with the call to scale back or tone down our SG50 celebrations on account of the death of former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew (""Rethink SG50 celebrations"" by Mr Tang Fook Meng; last Thursday).
Given the outpouring of grief and gratitude from Singaporeans and foreigners alike, there is even more reason to celebrate SG50 and the life and legacy of our founder and father of modern Singapore, with vigour and purpose.
Events of the past week spoke volumes of Mr Lee as modern Singapore's architect and guardian.
We should, therefore, take every opportunity to share his teachings, values and principles; and strengthen the systems that he and his colleagues have built for Singapore.
His legacy must live on and be instilled in future generations of Singaporeans.
What better way is there than to take advantage of the SG50 celebrations to kick-start various national education platforms?
This is a great opportunity to not just honour our pioneer generation leaders but also to educate our young on the selfless fighting spirit, the never-say-die attitude and can-do spirit, to overcome all odds in the pursuit of happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation, regardless of race, language and religion.
It is also a golden opportunity to promote to the region and the West our values and principles of self-sufficiency and reliance, racial and religious harmony, meritocracy and incorruptibility.

SOME people question whether the younger generation understands the achievements of former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and the anguish the older generation faced.
As someone born in the 1990s, I find it hard to comprehend the gravity of the revolutionary impact Mr Lee had on Singapore.
But I waited in queue with my father to pay my respects at Parliament House anyway. The wait was surprisingly smooth and orderly, with the help of volunteers from all walks of life.
Everyone looked after one another, sheltering strangers with umbrellas and distributing tissue paper, food and drinks.
I remember an army officer going down the line thanking everyone for waiting. A girl called back: ""Thank you for serving!"" The officer stopped and replied: ""Don't thank me, it's all for Lee Kuan Yew.""
I was heartened that everyone came together and stood in solidarity for a great leader.
The volunteers, who included young people, came out to ensure everyone's safety, and to serve graciously.
Seeing it all made me particularly proud to be a Singaporean.

Uphold values to ensure survival
THE best way we can honour former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew is to strive for the continual improvement of Singapore, and not to allow our country to become stagnant in the face of an uncertain future.
Let us, youth, contemplate what we can do to contribute to Singapore.
Let us uphold Mr Lee's core values of multiracialism and meritocracy in our everyday lives.
As we strive for individual excellence, we must also not forget to stay united as a nation, for only then can our nation grow stronger, not in numbers, but in spirit.

Read up on history to appreciate change
OLDER Singaporeans have first-hand experience of the challenges Singapore faced and how former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew overcame them and brought about immense change.
But without the benefit of experience, the younger generation cannot fully appreciate the hardships our forefathers went through.
Hence, young people should read up on the history of Singapore or Mr Lee's biography. They must know that what we have today will not last unless we sustain it.
Singapore's success did not come about by chance. It was due to the commitment of Mr Lee and his team. I hope Mr Lee's legacy will be preserved for years to come.

Have regular shows on founding fathers
I LEARNT a lot about former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and the challenges he faced during the pre- and post-independence years, through the recent radio and television broadcasts of his speeches.
Life was hard, and yet, Mr Lee and his team had the vision to build Singapore into the safe, green and vibrant country that we live in today.
His dauntless leadership, dynamic personality and love for his country and fellow men are an inspiration to young Singaporeans.
It would be good to have regular broadcasts about the works of our founding fathers.
This will remind Singaporeans about the struggles and hardships they went through, and that we cannot take peace and harmony for granted.

Room for students to develop other talents
I AM glad to know that some schools here have launched programmes which combine students' interests and studies (""Fly paper planes in class? It's schoolwork""; March 14).
It is great that schools are trying to lessen the emphasis on results.
Students nowadays face great peer pressure and the expectation of society to excel in studies.
As students try to meet these expectations, we often neglect our interests and hobbies.
Many of my classmates wanted to pursue dreams, such as being artists and actors, but were forced to face the ""reality"" that they would not be successful in these areas.
Students should be given equal opportunity and support to develop their non-academic talents, instead of being restricted.
I urge our educational system to work towards finding a balance between academic results and developing interests and talents in other areas.

","   The worst riots in Singapore happened 161 years ago. They were between Hokkien and Teochew groups and killed 600 people. Such dialect wars seem unthinkable today due to concerted efforts to rein in the tribal instinct. Racial and tribal harmony need vigilance to maintain.
IN MY last column, ""Miracle on Waterloo Street"" (Feb 21), I described our religious harmony as one of Singapore's greatest achievements of the past 50 years. In this column, I want to highlight another great achievement: our racial and tribal harmony. I want also to say that they are part of the legacy of our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
Racism and tribalism are two of the world's evils. Discrimination against persons on the basis of their race has ancient roots. It had led to many human tragedies, such as slavery and the Holocaust. Although racial discrimination has been repudiated by the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other instruments of international law, it still exists in many parts of the world.
In recent months, in the United States, several unarmed black men and boys had been killed by police officers. The US Justice Department has accused the police in Ferguson, Missouri, of racism.
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Selma civil rights march in Alabama, President Barack Obama observed: ""This nation's long racial history still casts its long shadow upon us. We know the march is not yet over, the race is not yet won.""
I can't help thinking that some of the Obama haters are racists who reject him because of the colour of his skin and not his policies.
Tribalism is as ancient as racism. Discrimination against persons based on their tribe is practised universally but has a special virulence in Africa. The hatred between the Hutus and Tutsis led to a genocide in Rwanda and Burundi. Kenya was nearly torn apart by the rivalry between the Kikuyus and the Luos.
Worst riots in Singapore's history
I SHALL use the word ""tribe"" in the Singapore context to refer to the intra-ethnic groups, for example, the Chinese clans.
Relations between the clans are so good today most readers will be shocked to learn the worst riots in Singapore's history were between the Hokkiens and Teochews. They occurred in 1854, lasted 10 days and killed 600 people.
Singapore's population consists of people of many races and tribes. Seventy-six per cent are Chinese. However, the Chinese come from different clans and dialect groups. A further 14 per cent are Malays.
Apart from the orang Melayu, they include the Javanese, Sundanese, Minang, Boyanese, Acehnese, Bataks, Bugis, etc. Seven per cent are Indians. The Indians comprise Tamils, Malayalees, Bengalis, Sikhs, Punjabis, Gujaratis, Sindhis, etc.
The remaining 3 per cent of the population consists of Eurasians, Jews, Arabs, Armenians and many others. The population of Singapore is therefore one of the most diverse in the world.
Maintaining unity and harmony
IN 1965, newly independent Singapore was faced with the enormous challenge of uniting this microcosm of humanity into one nation and maintaining peace and harmony among the different races and tribes.
The prospects were not promising because a year earlier, on July 21, 1964, during the celebration of Prophet Muhammad's birthday, an incident turned into a riot between the Malays and the Chinese.
Twenty-three people were killed and 454 were injured. Later that year, on Sept 2, another riot occurred. This one killed 13 people and injured 106 others. These two racial riots of 1964 were seared into the collective memories of Singaporeans who were determined to prevent their recurrence. What are the most important steps which Singapore has taken to secure racial and tribal harmony?Equal protection and non-discrimination
First, Singapore has used its Constitution and legal system to prohibit racial discrimination and to ensure that all persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law. No one in Singapore has any doubt that the law in the books is the law in practice.Presidential Council for Minority Rights
Second, the rights of minorities are protected by the Presidential Council for Minority Rights. The council has the power to scrutinise all proposed legislation in order to ensure that it does not discriminate against the members of any minority.
The council has been criticised for not having issued any adverse report to date. I think we should be pleased because there has been no need for it to do so.Ethnic quotas
Third, the State has taken a proactive and interventionist policy on encouraging citizens of different races to live together and not in racial ghettos.
Since 1989, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) has implemented a policy to ensure that the population in each block and each neighbourhood of public housing estates is made up of Chinese, Malays, Indians and others in the same ratios as in the general population.
Since 85 per cent of Singaporeans live in HDB housing, this means that a whole generation of Singaporeans has grown up living next door or in close proximity to neighbours of different races. HDB is therefore not just a developer and landlord. It has also played a significant role in nation-building.National service
Fourth, I believe that national service has played a very important role in nation-building. In Singapore, national service is compulsory and universal. All young men have to spend two years in national service. The experience of training and living together with comrades of different races in their platoons, sections and companies is a life-changing experience.
When they complete their training, they not only feel more patriotic but also more bonded as fellow Singaporeans. NS has probably contributed more than any other experience to the rapid evolution of our common identity as Singaporeans and to mutual understanding between Singaporeans of different races.Racial Harmony Day
Fifth, the first racial riot of 1964 was on July 21. Each year, students in all our schools celebrate Racial Harmony Day on July 21. We also have formed inter-racial confidence circles and harmony circles to promote inter-racial understanding and reduce mistrust, especially between Malays and non-Malays. Due to these initiatives, Singapore has developed a strong cultural norm in favour of such understanding. This is why the public reacted so strongly to Ms Amy Cheong when she made a pejorative comment about Malay weddings.Meritocracy
Sixth, the meritocratic system in Singapore is the best assurance to minorities that they compete with the majority on equal terms. A Malaysian friend once asked me why there were so many Indians in high places in Singapore. My answer was that they were there on merit and it was proof that Singapore is not a racist country.
We live in a troubled world. Racism and tribalism continue to bedevil many countries. We are very fortunate that we have enjoyed 50 years of racial and tribal peace and harmony.
We must treasure this precious achievement.

","   The outpouring of grief and depth of emotion shown by Singaporeans following the death of Mr Lee Kuan Yew in the early hours of March 23 was unprecedented. Insight looks back on the week in which Singaporeans mourned their founding prime minister.
IT WAS a scene replicated across many parts of Singapore the morning after news broke that the country's first prime minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, had died at 3.18am on Monday, March 23, at the age of 91.
In homes, offices, MRT platforms and bus terminals - almost any place where a television set, radio, smartphone or computer terminal was turned on to a news channel or website - people were gripped by what they heard.
Some bowed their heads in sorrow. Others buried their face in their hands in anguish or disbelief, or offered a silent prayer.
Yet others sat still for several moments, stunned, making sense of the moment they knew was inevitable, yet somehow hoped would not happen.
Concern over Mr Lee's health had become a major talking point in recent months. He had not been seen at a public event since the 60th anniversary celebration of the founding of the People's Action Party in November.
Confirmation of his condition came only in late February, just after Chinese New Year: He had been warded in the intensive care unit of the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) with severe pneumonia since Feb 5.
Regular updates on his condition from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) gave rise to hope, worry, then dread.
On March 17, the PMO said Mr Lee's condition had worsened due to an infection, 40 days after he was admitted to the hospital. Brief daily statements followed for the next five days, each time saying he had weakened further.
Singaporeans from across the island began turning up at SGH to offer prayers and good wishes, to stand vigil, to will him on.
The hospital eventually designated a special area for them. So large were the number of people, get-well cards and flowers for the man that few knew in person, but who all said had made a significant difference to their lives - from the homes and opportunities they had, to the stability, economic security and brighter future their children now have.
A tent was eventually put up outside to shelter the gifts, cards and flowers, and the area it covered was expanded a day later.
In their messages of support, well-wishers shared a common sentiment: gratitude, whether for help given personally or in shaping the country they live in.
Mr Patrick Ang, 41, who has cerebral palsy and uses a motorised wheelchair, and sells Singapore Sweep tickets, left a card.
He wrote to Mr Lee for help after he was robbed in his Bukit Merah rental flat three years ago. Mr Lee helped him move to a new rental flat in Clementi.
Deliveryman Zuraimi Abdul Karim, 55, dropped by with his sister to offer a silent prayer: ""A whole generation knows the hardship he faced building Singapore. He's a great man to us.""
Tanjong Pagar Community Club, at the heart of the constituency that Mr Lee represented for almost 60 years since he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1955, also set aside space for cards and flowers.
Even though Mr Lee stepped down as prime minister in 1990, he was still an influential member of Cabinet as senior minister, and then as minister mentor, until 2011. After that he remained an MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC.
The crowds at SGH and Tanjong Pagar grew over the weekend of March 21 and 22, when hundreds flocked to the community club, many unable to hold back tears.
They remembered growing up when the area was filthy and dilapidated, and recalled how Mr Lee had more than delivered on his promises to improve their conditions.
Then came the dreaded news in the small hours of the morning of March 23. As the nation awoke to find that Mr Lee had died, many tuned in to television and radio broadcasts and live streaming online as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, visibly tired, told them: ""The first of our founding fathers is no more.""
Flags would be at half-mast, there would be a seven-day mourning period, a state funeral service. The details came thick and fast, planned with an efficiency that Mr Lee had made into a Singapore hallmark.
By the time Mr Lee's body returned to the Istana grounds shortly after noon on Monday, hundreds had gathered outside its main gates to bid farewell.
The casket was laid to rest in Sri Temasek, the official residence of the prime minister, for a private wake for family members and close friends.
Six, then 10 community tribute centres were opened across the island for the public to pen messages and pay their respects, and 18 in all were open a day later.
Over the week that followed, some 1.2 million visited these centres to leave notes of thanks in Chinese, Malay, Tamil and English. They brought artwork and craftwork, soft toys, pictures.
Some highlighted their gratitude for the policies that brought the country from Third to First World status; improved their housing; provided education and jobs. Minorities especially singled out Mr Lee's commitment to multiracialism and meritocracy. Many others said Mr Lee and the progress he brought to the country made them proud to be Singaporean.
""It is a bond that goes beyond policies,"" Senior Minister of State Indranee Rajah said in Tanjong Pagar of the affection for Mr Lee.
""He gave this nation pride.""
Lining up in the sun
THE strength of that bond was evident in the crowds that lined the streets to see Mr Lee's casket make its way on March 25 from the Istana to Parliament House, where he would lie in state.
The route was packed, some having arrived at sunrise that day. Amid the throng, a man held a plastic miniature Singapore flag aloft, and that, too, was at half-mast.
Inside Sri Temasek, officers draped the State flag over the casket, the crescent and stars lying over the head and close to the heart of Mr Lee, before carrying and laying it on a gun carriage.
As the procession made the 2km journey along Orchard Road, Bras Basah and North Bridge Road, queues were quiet, respectful. And as it reached Parliament House, there were some who cheered, applauded, and called out: ""Lee Kuan Yew! Lee Kuan Yew! Lee Kuan Yew! Lee Kuan Yew!""
By noon on Wednesday, the line of people converging at Parliament's gates had grown impossibly long: stretching along the banks of the Singapore River that he vowed to - and did - clean up, and the queues snaked to Hong Lim Green, Battery Road and Coleman Street.
Thousands braved the sweltering heat, waiting patiently in line for over eight hours to file past Mr Lee's casket, even if it was just for a few seconds.
Among them was housewife Jenn Lee, 54, who grew up in Tanjong Pagar and remembers Mr Lee as her MP: ""He transformed this from a shipping port into a big city, and I wanted to show my gratitude and express how blessed we are to have had him lead us.""
The queues were a scene never before seen in Singapore. So overwhelming was the public's response that the State Funeral Organising Committee chose to extend visiting hours not once, but twice - from the originally scheduled 10am to 8pm, first to midnight, and then round the clock until Saturday evening.
""When we planned this one week of national mourning, we of course expected a tremendous outpouring of emotions,"" National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said on March 26.
""But the reality exceeded our expectations.""
Organisers had, by then, implemented a more organised queue system, with the Padang as the starting point - including a separate line for those who were older or had special needs. Like many public-spirited businesses and individuals had done previously, bottles of water and umbrellas were made available to those in line.
Inside Parliament House, ushers encouraged visitors to move along quickly - though individuals still made the effort to bow; some knelt, waved, saluted.
And many wept.
Try as the organisers did to discourage the public from joining the queues when waiting times were at their longest - eight, nine, 10 hours - and to head for community tribute centres instead, the crowds kept on coming.
Transport officials chipped in, working with SMRT and SBS Transit to extend train and feeder bus services past normal hours to operate round the clock.
PM Lee and several ministers visited those waiting in line to thank them for coming and for being patient. Those waiting, in turn, urged them, PM Lee in particular, to take care of themselves.
""Singaporeans aren't given to outward displays of emotion. We have a reputation for being diligent, task-oriented and focused on our work,"" Mr Walter Lim, who runs marketing agency Cooler Insights, wrote.
But, somehow, this reserve crumbled over the week, he added of the overwhelming outpouring of sentiment.
The queues grew longer on Thursday, when a special session of Parliament was held. There were few dry eyes in the Chamber. The most poignant reminder of Mr Lee's absence was a spray of white flowers placed on his empty seat in the House.
Outside Parliament, tributes came from community and religious groups, which held memorials and special services to honour Mr Lee and his contributions.
Political scientist Bilveer Singh of the National University of Singapore, who joined the queue at the Padang on Thursday night with his wife and waited seven hours, tells Insight: ""You felt there was a nation out there.""
Recalling how volunteers handed out apples and drinks, and strangers shared snacks and stories, he added: ""We were all united. And we were all crying, we were in tears, especially when we saw the hearse.""
Even the military guards who stood ramrod straight as they kept vigil by the casket struggled to fight back tears, which others dabbed away for them.
By Friday, the volume of people swelled even further. With the work-week behind them and a weekend ahead, many felt it would be all right to tough it out. Besides, with the cut-off for the queue scheduled for Saturday night, many took the plunge to stand in line.
But with an eye on the increasing numbers, and safety, organisers closed entry to the queue late on Friday night till the congestion cleared. The lines reopened early on Saturday morning. Yet when the 8pm queue cut-off time came around on Saturday, many were left disappointed.
By the time the last visitor left Parliament House at around midnight, some 455,000 people had paid their last respects in person.
Whichever way you look at it, the numbers are astonishing, said political scientist Lam Peng Er of the East Asian Institute.
The figure of 1.7 million visitors who were at the lying in state and community tribute sites translates into one in two Singaporeans turning up to pay their respects.
Dr Lam's explanation for the turnout: ""For most Singaporeans, their lives were intertwined with his."" Many, in person or through their parents, knew what life was like when Mr Lee took office in 1959 and the tremendous change Singapore has since witnessed.
Standing in the rain
AND Singaporeans were prepared to do it all again on Sunday - in driving rain as the skies opened up as Mr Lee's casket left Parliament House shortly after noon for the procession to the funeral service at the University Cultural Centre in Kent Ridge.
For a handful of those waiting for the funeral procession outside City Hall and across the Padang, the torrential rain brought back memories of the 1968 National Day Parade, also at the Padang, when a downpour drenched all those who were taking part.
But the parade carried on, and as Mr Lee said at a National Day dinner at the Tanjong Pagar community centre a few days after that parade: ""All those who watched Friday's Parade could take heart from the display of discipline and determination in the face of heavy rain and high winds.""
He added: ""This is what makes Singapore take shape: the growing confidence of the younger generation that has got the gumption, the guts and the gusto to carve a future for themselves in Southeast Asia.""
Waiting to wave Mr Lee off at Queensway on Sunday was Ms Wan Fatt Ngai, 64, who was a student cadet at the Padang in 1968.
""We were all wet, rooted to the ground, but nobody moved. It was so cold,"" she recalled, adding that she remembered Mr Lee being fiery and inspiring.
""It didn't mean anything to me then. It was only later as I looked around at the changes to the country - the houses, the clean river - that I realised the impact this man had on our country.
""It seems fitting that we are sending him off in the rain,"" she added.
Many who braved the downpour on Sunday, 47 years on, were students just like Ms Wan was. Others also lined the streets along virtually every stretch of the 15.4km-long route to Kent Ridge.
In all, an estimated 100,000 lined the streets. Many gathered from early morning, and others joined in from nearby churches, mosques and temples, or their homes along the route.
Wherever they stood in line, many said they were grateful for the opportunities that Mr Lee and his team opened up for them and their children. And so they designed placards, gave out flowers and cheered his name as the cortege made its way down rain-slicked roads.
After the procession passed, many headed home or to community and tribute centres to watch the funeral service. The 10 eulogies celebrated Mr Lee's dedication to his family and work, his devotion to the country, and his determination to make life better for his fellow Singaporeans.
And when the civil defence sirens sounded at around 4.30pm, many nationwide rose to join in a minute of silence, a final honour for Mr Lee.
Trains stopped at stations with their doors open, as did buses, and staff and passengers at Changi Airport.
The moment of silence over, in unison Singaporeans recited the pledge and sang the National Anthem - with sadness, but also with a realisation that it was now up to them all to take the nation that Mr Lee bequeathed to them higher, further along.
A new Singapore spirit?
THE sense of loss and grief over the week-long period of national mourning reignited what many Singaporeans feel they have lost in recent years: a sense of national cohesion and what held them together as one people.
And on this one occasion, political and ideological differences were set aside. Those who were previously content to sit back and allow critics and angry voices to dominate social media and the online space, came out to express their views.
As Mr Walter Lim noted, whether people loved or loathed Mr Lee, his death appears to have sparked something.
""For the first time in like, forever, the silent majority have made their feelings felt everywhere - online and off-line. We are not emotionless and passionless. We care and we show it when the occasion calls for it,"" he wrote.
""This peaceful revolt is exhibited in how many new voices have emerged. For the longest time, Singapore's online community was known to be anti-government, antagonistic and attention-seeking. With the passing of Mr Lee, a new movement amongst the moderates has emerged.""
But Mr Lim feels Mr Lee's death also reunified Singaporeans, who might ordinarily be preoccupied with other concerns.
Singapore High Commissioner to Australia Burhan Gafoor said at a memorial to Mr Lee in Perth on April 1: ""What began as a week of national mourning became a week of national bonding. On the streets of Singapore, there was a palpable sense of unity, a sense of community and a distinct feeling of pride in being Singaporean.""
And as Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen noted in a Facebook post, Mr Lee's death had ""galvanised Singaporeans here and all over into a stronger nation ... So many world leaders I met after the funeral service said that Mr Lee's passing was sorrowful; the way Singaporeans behaved in mourning him was admirable; and that Mr Lee would be proud of this.""
Dr Lam tells Insight that the events of the past week spoke much to citizens and to outsiders about the resilience of Singaporeans as a people.
""They showed that ordinary people could stand in line when they are motivated and driven by conviction. If you are an investor, you might think you've picked the right place, where people may grumble, but when it comes to the crunch, they can rough it out,"" he said.
""It also sent a signal to our neighbours and friends: our country is small but it is special. It is more than just high-rise buildings or a financial centre. People are quite tough and can pull together. In a way, it was a cathartic coming of age - you could say it was Mr Lee Kuan Yew's last great service to the country.""
When Singapore marks its 50th anniversary of independence in August, there will be more than a tinge of sadness that Mr Lee is not there to celebrate with the nation.
But if the scenes from the seven days from March 23 to 29 are anything to go by, then there is hope for a real and renewed commitment to cherish that sense of togetherness and to collectively keep it going into the future.
It is the least that the people and the country can do to repay and honour the man who gave his all to rally and hold Singaporeans together in the first place.

"," Emotions; Leadership
","   The unprecedented display of emotion after Mr Lee Kuan Yew's death was because people respected Mr Lee as a man of principle, whose leadership made their lives better, even if they disagreed with some of his policies.
THE period of national mourning for Mr Lee Kuan Yew will remain vivid in the memory of Singaporeans for many years to come.
For seven days, Singaporeans experienced what I called ""nationally shared emotions"".
It was a collective grief, accompanied by a deep sense of gratitude to a great man who devoted his adult life to building a city-state that Singaporeans can be proud to call home.
As a behavioural scientist, I was constantly asked over the last two weeks to explain the psychology underlying Singaporeans' public display of emotions.
Singaporeans are now returning to the normalcy of their daily lives. It is time to take stock of Singaporeans' recent collective experiences. And it would be irresponsible to not address the question of a post-Lee Kuan Yew Singapore.
Personal experiences, shared beliefs
MANY Singaporeans grew up with Mr Lee as their iconic leader.
They heard his hard-hitting speeches and experienced his commanding presence even if it was only through watching the television. They have shared beliefs that he was the primary person responsible for transforming Singapore.
But why are younger people - who have not known Mr Lee as their prime minister - also intensively moved?
It is true that they learnt in school that he is the founding father of modern Singapore. But they have also heard about the real experiences of older people or others who know about Mr Lee. And they grew up listening to stories about the rare combination of leadership abilities and values embodied in the man.
In other words, Mr Lee has been Singapore's national leader, who has been revered or talked about among Singaporeans for over 50 years. His influence and impact on Singapore and the lives of Singaporeans has been long and lasting.
And when Singaporeans look at their country, many are likely to agree that, overall, the positives outweigh the negatives.
Psychology of public reactions
DID Singaporeans simply feel obliged to acknowledge that Mr Lee was primarily responsible for the country's improved material conditions? Research on psychological commitment has shown that people can be motivated to do something when there is a sense of obligation.
By itself, commitment based on obligation - as in feeling duty-bound to do something - can explain behaviours reflecting determination and perseverance, such as queueing for many hours to pay last respects to Mr Lee. But it cannot explain the visible grief and public display of emotions.
Complaints of inconvenience, which should occur to some degree if people feel that they have to, even when they do not want to, were conspicuously absent.
Moreover, volunteering and looking out for each other were in abundance. To understand public reactions, we need to go beyond commitment based on obligation to include commitment based on emotion. Emotional commitment is about motivation based on ""want to"".
When people are emotionally committed, they experience a strong feeling of attachment and sense of belonging. They feel like ""part of the family"". Studies have shown that emotional commitment is often accompanied by a display of emotions. It also leads to ""citizenship"" behaviours, such as putting up with inconveniences, pro-social behaviours, taking initiatives to improve a situation, and volunteering.
But given Mr Lee's strict enforcement of obedience to authority at the expense of personal freedom, or an authoritarian approach, can we still say that people are rooted to him through emotional commitment?
In fact, there is no inconsistency. It turns out that emotional commitment can be developed over time through positive personal experiences and beliefs based on perceptions of principled treatment.
First, Singaporeans have personally enjoyed many positives in their life experiences that are attributable to Mr Lee's efforts and decisions. For example, in addition to living in a vibrant metropolis, Singaporeans enjoy a safe and secure country and a harmonious society that emphasises multiracialism.
Despite the usual complaints of stress and strain, Singaporeans have personally experienced a place that is highly liveable, for themselves and their family.
Second, in addition to being a pragmatic leader, Mr Lee has been widely perceived as a man of principle.
While there may not be a consensus on the desirability of all his principles, many that he zealously safeguard have benefited Singaporeans though the building of a fair and just society.
Singaporeans from all social backgrounds have been able to excel and be rewarded under a meritocratic system based on performance rather than one's connections.
People have also experienced fairness and justice from a government with zero tolerance for corruption. And many would describe Singapore as a land of opportunity, where self-reliance can lead to achievements of goals.
Mr Lee is seen as a man who practised what he preached, said what he meant, and meant what he said.
So, beyond his intellect, there was a deep respect and trust for Mr Lee's character. Note that this is not about his personality or rationale for specific policies. Singaporeans may disagree strongly with some policies advocated by Mr Lee or dislike some of his personality traits. But they appreciate the values that he painstakingly cultivated, and the principles that he unwaveringly upheld for Singapore.
Singaporeans' shared values include integrity, fairness and social harmony, and guiding principles such as the rule of law, accountability and people-centricity. For over 50 years, Mr Lee translated these values and principles into Singapore's collective narratives and convictions. And so, today, Singaporeans hold strongly to their beliefs in meritocracy, multiracialism, incorruptibility and self-reliance.
For Singaporeans, Mr Lee's death activated the realisation that the generally good life that they and their children have been enjoying did not come easily. Neither did it come automatically. It came about because of Mr Lee and the team of pioneers he led.
The recounting of past events and Mr Lee's past speeches in the media played a role in this mental activation.
But it was not the primary reason for the public's reactions. People could have responded the way they did only if they have existing strong beliefs, trust and respect for Mr Lee.
And real experiences of positive well-being living in Singapore. These beliefs and experiences have, over time, developed into a commitment that is based on both obligation and emotion.
It is noteworthy, though, that none of the above tells us anything directly about whether Singaporeans are happy or unhappy with the government of the day or prevailing policies.
What's next?
THE national mourning has also turned out to be a period of reflection. It is likely that Mr Lee will remain an inspiration for many Singaporeans moving forward.
But how do we imagine a Singapore without Mr Lee Kuan Yew?
There are good reasons to be confident that a post-Lee Kuan Yew Singapore will continue to thrive. Precisely because of what Mr Lee has done in building up Singapore and putting it on the map, the world now knows of the Singapore brand - Singapore is a choice place to invest in and partner with.
And this is more than just its strategic location, excellent infrastructure and global connectivity. Backed by its solid record - including the past two decades when Mr Lee was no longer in charge - it is a nation of trustworthy people who can and will deliver what is promised.
In my view, this is Mr Lee's greatest legacy. He has put in place institutions and values that ensure Singapore will continue to survive without depending on any one individual. Singaporeans can be optimistic about the future of Singapore without Mr Lee.
But Singapore's continued success is not a given or guaranteed. The country needs capable and trustworthy leaders who are citizen-centric with a global outlook. Leaders who ensure that the fundamentals of economics and foreign relations are well taken care of.
The country also needs communities who will speak up and step up to address those issues that the Government cannot tackle alone, or those that are better resolved without government intervention. This builds social capital.
And the country needs individual citizens who would uphold shared values and guiding principles.
This should translate into how people think, feel and act. But it also includes the conscious efforts to transmit values and principles to the next generation.
Singapore has the foundations for us to be confident that we can make things happen. As individuals, there is hope to achieve our goals and aspirations. Singaporeans can be optimistic about the progress and future of our society.
And when we recover from adversity and adapt to changes, we become more resilient, individually and nationally.
This psychological capital, together with economic and social capital, will see us through.

"," Think
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Books; Autobiographies
","   Soon after The Singapore Story, the first of the two-part memoirs of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, was published in 1998, a copy landed on my desk in the Straits Times newsroom.
I had not expected it. It was from Mr Lee, and was signed by him. He penned a simple message that seemed characteristic of him: ""To Warren Fernandez, With my thanks for the attention to detail and to the broad shape of the book to make it reading friendly.""
It was a kind reward for our efforts. I was one of several journalists roped in to assist him with the editing of his manuscript. This followed on from an earlier book on him that my colleagues and I had written, titled Lee Kuan Yew: The Man And His Ideas.
Admittedly, as a young journalist then barely out of my 20s, being asked to critique the work of the country's founding father seemed a daunting task. So, when the opportunity arose, I asked him with some trepidation exactly what he was expecting us to do, and why he was taking such great pains with his book.
He answered matter-of-factly: ""I want it to be read. No use if I write it and people don't read it. I want them to read it, especially the young, and understand how we got here.""
This recollection came to me last Sunday when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong recounted how Mr Lee had been relentless in his efforts to secure Singapore's future, including writing book after book in his final years.
""His biggest worry was that younger Singaporeans would lose the instinct for what made Singapore tick. This was why he continued writing books into his 90s,"" said PM Lee in his eulogy to his father at the University Cultural Centre.
""Why did he do this? So that a new generation of Singaporeans could learn from his experience, and understand what their security, prosperity, and future depended on.""
Indeed, Mr Lee seemed determined to give his memoirs his best shot. He was assiduous in seeking out and responding to our critiques. Initially, I had wondered if he would really be open to our suggestions. But I soon discovered that each time we sent him our views, a revised version would come back in a flash.
""Is this better? Does it work now?"" he would ask.
We replied: Could we have more details? More personal anecdotes? More context to help explain the point being made, and guide the reader along?
Again the revisions would come, with a similar response: ""Does this work?""
Back and forth it went, version after version, so many that we sometimes found it hard to keep track of all of them. Mr Lee never seemed to tire of the process. And so over time, the caricature of the man as a fearsome leader, who brooked no dissent and was impervious to others' opinions, became less and less real to me.
So, you might ask, just what was Mr Lee so worried about that he felt a need to put all these thoughts to paper? Was it a concern that younger Singaporeans might not support his ruling People's Action Party as strongly as their parents had?
Obviously as a political leader, he must have wanted his party to continue to win support, but his concerns seemed to go much further. I came to this conclusion gradually as I pondered his responses to questions we posed him on various occasions. He would say often that his primary concern was not just the support for, or survival of, the PAP, but for whoever could deliver good government in the interests of the people of Singapore.
""Do people have good jobs? Do they get the education to prepare for those jobs? Can they afford to buy their own home? How will they defend those homes? How will they provide for their children? These are the issues that cut to the bone,"" I recall him saying, in words to that effect.
Beyond these were even deeper issues which he seemed especially concerned that younger Singaporeans grasped - not just intellectually but also instinctively - namely, just how unlikely a nation Singapore is, how deep the emotive pulls of race and religion can be, or how these latent forces can be so easily roused and whipped into a frenzy for political effect.
And how vulnerable a little red dot like Singapore was, and remains - even though, or perhaps especially as, it has prospered over the years - in a world where the positions of seemingly friendly countries could ebb and flow, and change without much warning.
So, as I watched last Sunday's solemn ceremonies to send Mr Lee to his rest, I could not help but wonder what he would have made of all that unexpected outpouring of grief.
To what effect, he might have asked, or just how does this help Singapore?
Clearly, many Singaporeans were deeply saddened by Mr Lee's passing. Many of us had hoped that he would hold out until August at least, to join in the 50th anniversary celebrations, especially the parade at the Padang, where he had made so many momentous proclamations. Indeed, it would have been fitting for him to be there. You can just imagine the cheers and applause that would have greeted him, judging by the response he received at past parades.
Perhaps that might have pleased Mr Lee. Yet, I can't help but suspect that he would have wanted more than just some fleeting feel-good moment on Aug 9.
Rather, he might have been more heartened by how his passing served to galvanise the country, including the young, into remembering some of the ideals he stood for, the no-holds-barred battles he fought, the tough-minded decisions he took, and yes, also the fallout that some of these entailed.
In a way, the events of the emotional week of mourning did more to focus minds on the real significance of SG50 than anything else so far. That was Mr Lee's parting gift to Singapore. Since he could not rise from his grave to fix problems he spotted, as he once proclaimed he would, he at least managed in death to rally his people around, just one last time, as he had so often done in life.
These sombre thoughts were running through my mind as the National Anthem sounded, and I watched on television the crowd in the hall, and outside, singing Majulah Singapura and reciting the Singapore Pledge.
How many of us know what it all means, or even how the anthem and pledge had come about, I wondered. I confess I had to look it up to be sure. I was reminded for my pains that the anthem many call the Mari Kita was actually composed in 1958 as a song for use by the City Council at public events. A shortened version was later adopted as a state anthem when Singapore gained self-government in 1959, and later became the National Anthem of our independent Republic in 1965.
It had deliberately been written in simple Malay to make it easy to remember, and expressed well the yearning for a ""new spirit"" of unity, amid the bitter divisions of race and religion in this disparate society. This would ultimately give rise to a new state founded on the principles of racial equality and meritocracy.
Go ahead, play the tune in your mind: Mari kita (come let us all), rakyat Singapura (people of Singapore) sama-sama menuju (proceed together towards) bahagia (happiness); cita-cita kita yang mulia (may our noble aspirations bring) berjaya Singapura (Singapore success). Marilah kita bersatu (come let us all unite), dengan semangat yang baru (in a new spirit), semua kita berseru (as together we proclaim), Majulah Singapura (Onwards Singapore), Majulah Singapura.
The same goes for the pledge, as MPs recalled recently how Mr Lee had once rushed to the House to speak after he read a newspaper report which led him to feel he had to make clear to all that the lofty ideals expressed in the pledge were noble aspirations to be strived for, but which would not be made reality simply by repeated assertion.
That, I figure, is what Mr Lee worried about. He wanted us to not just know the words and mouth them, or buy his books and not reflect on them. He wanted us to realise just how much work it would take to live up to the ideals, safeguard what had been built, and secure our future.
For unless we did, the words and books, the anthem and pledge, the battles fought and won, the global metropolis built from mudflats, would simply not endure. And that, as Mr Lee was wont to say, would be that.

"," Success; Attitudes; Trust
","   GIC group president and former civil service head Lim Siong Guan spoke on honour, wealth, leadership and Mr Lee Kuan Yew's legacy at a Business Times conference last Tuesday. Here are edited excerpts of his speech.
OFTEN when visitors come to Singapore, they are briefed on the Housing Board, the Central Provident Fund, the Urban Redevelopment Authority, the education system, the health system and so on.
While these are critical factors, I believe there is a deeper cultural reason to explain Singapore's success since independence.
The explanation lies in an ability to trust Singapore, where promises are kept, the rule of law is maintained, justice is assured, intellectual property rights are protected, meritocracy is practised and government policies are consistent and predictable.
Singapore offers integrity, incorruptibility, reliability, quality and trustworthiness, keeping promises even though it may involve lots of hard work and overcoming unexpected difficulties.
""Trust"" and ""trustworthy"" are the key words.
Trust is the lifeblood that determines the quality of relationships that undergird every community and society.
And honour is the foundation of trust, where the people, businesses and government deliver on their word of honour.
Singapore's success in the last 50 years is the result of human imagination and hard work, as well as the courage to be different and unique, founded on honour, integrity and trust that the people of Singapore will do what is good and right for themselves, their families and their society.
It is a matter of ""enlightened self-interest"", where honour makes good sense for life, living and livelihood.
This still has to be the blueprint for the continued success and survival of Singapore.
As we look into the future, we can also expect an increasing desire by citizens to speak out on a widening array of national issues, and to be able to act on their own initiatives but with government support or, at least, tolerance if not approbation.
In order to maintain peace, harmony and stability even in such times of debate, there must be a national consensus that all things are done with a view to enhance the well-being of the nation for the generations to come.
To achieve this, there must be a strong vein of honour and mutual respect between individuals even when there may be sharp differences in views.
Attitudes towards wealth
IN THE early years, Singapore was poor, and the life attitude of both the people and the Government was that of a ""poor man"" - life is uncertain, earn what you can, save what you can, spend on what you need, we never know what tomorrow will bring, so be prepared and save for the rainy day.
So Singapore was at Point A of the Grid - country is poor, and life attitude of the people is that of a poor man.
With the passage of time, Singapore became rich. But many people still perceive the Government as having the attitude of the ""poor man"".
So the people reckon Singapore is at Point B of the Grid, though some people have said that, in fairness, the Government is not at Point B but at some point between B and C.
However, what the people are wondering is, if we are really rich, shouldn't we be at Point C of the Grid - country is rich and the Government provides for the people - for a life attitude of that of a rich man?
And that, to my mind, is the fundamental reason for much of the angst between the people and the Government: The people reckon we should be at Point C, while the Government is perceived as sticking to Point B.
The Government, understandably, has the particular concern that if Singapore is at Point C, it could be setting itself up to fall into Point D of the Grid, where the country is in fact poor, but the Government provides for the people as though they are rich.
The interesting question is: Are there countries at Point D of the Grid?
Many observers reckon there are indeed many countries at Point D, starting with Greece as the obvious case, and then the United States, Europe and Japan, where people have been used to having their governments adopt policies and provide benefits like a ""rich man"", but in fact these governments no longer have the revenues to support such policies, so they borrow to be able to continue to extend the benefits to the people and have huge sums of unfunded liabilities.
The ""poverty"" of these governments is often ""invisible"" because of their ""pay-as-you-go"" pension schemes, social security schemes and medical support schemes, where the pension and benefits for the retirees are paid for by collections from the working population, a formula under threat as the working populations dwindle with low birth rates and immigration, while the retiree populations balloon with increased life expectancies arising from advances in medicine and healthcare.
The interesting question is: Can Singapore recover from Point D, should it fall from Point C to Point D?
Because if Singapore can recover from Point D to Point C, rather than inexorably go from Point D to Point A, perhaps the risk of getting to Point C may be worth taking. Singapore had made it from Point A to Point B by astute national leadership.
It was leadership making good use of opportunities arising from a confluence of geostrategic factors, whether it was the withdrawal of British military forces east of Suez or the Vietnam War or the Plaza Accord.
The situation is different today, so that the chances of recovering from Point D to go back to Point C rather than Point A are far from assured.
Why risk it?
Perhaps the Government thinks the chances of avoiding Point D are best assured by staying at Point B.
The real discussion that is necessary, in my mind, should be to first recognise the disconnect in a public perception of the Government being at Point B while the public desire is to be at Point C, and to have a good national debate on how to keep staying at Point C if Singapore moves there.
This national debate has to be centred on two questions: What economic policies does Singapore need to keep the wealth level up?
What social policies does Singapore need to keep spending and expectations within sustainable limits?
Young must seek to lead
WE FACE what has been referred to as a Vuca world - a future that is Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous.
It will be impossible to deal with complexity in a reactive mode. Big data is the catchword today, and certainly a lot more benefit and opportunity are waiting to be discovered and mined.
And to the fear that computers will take over the world one day, as computers become smarter and smarter, has come the riposte: Humans must become smarter than the computer, and they can be if they work at it.
While computers may crunch the numbers faster, humans must imagine better.
The way to deal with complexity and ambiguity is for leaders to offer a clear vision, and then figure out how the vision intersects with what parts of the complex world.
We cannot afford to have leaders who lead by crisis, whose approach is reactiveness and whose agenda is simply to do what the people want them to do.
Leaders must be anticipative and able to communicate a worthy future.
They are leaders whose values are clear, whose idea of ""good"" carries the support of the people, whose principles for thought and action are exemplary, who are not arrogant but confident, who are consistent yet flexible, who are steadfast yet adaptable, whose intent is always to be in time for the future while moving country and company to be the best it can be, and whose heart always cares for the people.
As every generation needs its own leaders who understand their generation better and can more instinctively connect with them, the young in Singapore must not eschew leadership but seek it.
Dealing with the Vuca world requires young people who have self-confidence, courage, integrity, wisdom, judgment, energy and imagination.
In any competition, whether it be between countries or companies, energy and imagination always wins.
We must keep developing the next generation of leaders, who have to be competent, committed and confident.
Singapore needs leaders with vigour, spirit and courage. Because leadership is about making things happen, success is never guaranteed and the path is often uncertain.
Stand on the shoulders of giants by learning from our forefathers who have built Singapore into what it is today, but we must seek to exceed them, to chart our own path because our circumstances are different from theirs.
It is not what they did per se that is important, but the spirit and attitude in which they conducted themselves that merit learning.
Their qualities of boldness, uniqueness, pursuit of excellence, unwavering determination, readiness to learn from mistakes and reliability should serve as our compass of values and principles as we sail forth into uncharted waters.
The Lee Kuan Yew spirit
WE MUST not miss the legacy of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. It is not the bustling metropolis that is Singapore, nor is it Singapore's entry into the class of First World economy from Third World.
Mr Lee's legacy is the spirit of courage and imagination, integrity above all else, delivering on promises and being a people of our word.
It is energy and enterprise, determination and dedication, seeking to understand others and accommodate their concerns and perspectives as much as possible, honouring and respecting others for their views even if they may be very different from his.
It is an openness to new ideas and new realities even while sticking with fundamental principles like character and trustworthiness, steadfastness and adaptability, excellence and meritocracy.
What Singapore is today is the evidence of the legacy.

"," Opinion
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Gender
","   THE latest numbers that point to a narrowing of Singapore's gender gap seem encouraging, although the positive picture they paint might be papering over the finer cracks preventing full equality.
At first glance, however, Singaporean women are making promising headway. MasterCard's latest survey on gender equality in Asia, for instance, places Singapore fourth among the 16 Asia-Pacific countries polled.
What's more gratifying, Singapore women largely aced the survey's key yardsticks of education and leadership. Our girls are neck-and-neck with the boys in enrolment at secondary and tertiary levels - the collective point where education offers young adults opportunities to aim for a meaningful foothold in life. In another important measure, men have a four-to-three edge over women.
But once hired, more women remain in regular employment than men.
To cap the cheerful news, Singapore's high ranking in leadership appears to disprove a common perception that women are a subordinate presence in business and politics. Yet there remains that little buzz at the back of one's head insisting that all is not quite with what the numbers are saying.
Perhaps one reason is that statistical advances attest mainly to the improvement in societal infrastructure - systems built on principles of fairness and meritocracy. The cautionary dissonance lies in something less tractable - cultural notions and lingering mindsets.
Perceptions of gender roles, for example, are familiar enough: Women are still expected to work, nurture kids, care for elders, and be homemakers. And despite mum-friendly legislation, anecdotal evidence suggests some employers still try to undermine the intent of the law, suggesting that while society at large is willing, many individuals aren't.
Statistics also bear witness to this cultural intractability. While there are 40 female business owners for every 100 male counterparts, the boardrooms remain an old boys' club where men occupy more than 90 per cent of the seats. As for riches, only two women are among the 50 wealthiest people here, if one were to exclude the heirs of family fortunes. Women politicians may have progressed, but men MPs outnumber the women 84-18; and there is but one woman among 18 full Cabinet ministers.
The need for a Singapore women's hall of fame and the absence of one for the men offers an ironic glimpse of a vestigial cultural bias linked to certain perceptions of gender.
Among the Asia-Pacific nations polled, only New Zealand and the Philippines had more than half as many female as male business and government leaders. There's simply no reason why Singapore cannot be among them.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew was determined to solve it with a country-first approach.
After Singapore's independence, the Singapore Chinese business chamber approached him to ask that he make Chinesethe national language and official medium of instruction.
Mr Lee could have agreed, to gain the support of the 75 per cent of Singaporeans who were Chinese.
But he turned it down for Singapore's competitiveness. He implemented meritocracy, regardless of race.
Malaysia's bumiputera policies have cost the country losses.
Even the bumiputera in Malaysia are questioning why the country should be helping rich bumiputera gain from government contracts.
Malaysia should learn from Singapore to help only the needy, regardless of race.

",NA,"   TODAY, as Mr Lee Kuan Yew's torch passes on to the next generation of leaders under Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, we are hopeful that Singapore is united and well prepared to meet all the challenges going forward.
As a first step, I hope that PM Lee and his cohort will deliver on the promises they made during the 2011 General Election.
They have already fulfilled some promises, but it is an ongoing process to build a more inclusive society with compassion and meritocracy.
We need to hear from Generation Y - those born between 1980 and 1998 - as well as those born after 1998 about education and job availability.
They, too, have their needs and aspirations.
There is also an urgent need to promote small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which can help to create more jobs.
Many SMEs find the going very tough because of a lack of funding.
Some function as outsource arms of big companies, but find their payments held back for months. I hope auditors and the authorities can help to ensure that the big companies pay the SMEs without delay.
On the economic front, we also have to grow our gross domestic product.
There is a growing sense of complacency and of our workforce giving out less but wanting more.
This must not be allowed, and the call for greater productivity must not fall on deaf ears.
Lastly, we can do more to have more women in politics and corporations. Let us uplift our women and pass legislation to fix a quota of, say, one woman to three men.
There are no soft options, nor is there room for failure.
The Government must be all-inclusive and lead us to a more progressive Singapore.

"," Prime ministers
","   THE late Mr Lee Kuan Yew's great vision, uncompromising principles on strong governance, and intolerance towards corruption and inefficiency have contributed to Singapore's rapid growth over the years.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who served as Malaysia's longest-serving prime minister, has also been credited by many for the successes he brought to Malaysia during his reign (""Lee Kuan Yew was 'kiasu', says Mahathir""; Sunday).
Both men have been seen as being authoritarian, ruling their countries with an iron fist. It is clear, however, that Mr Lee demonstrated other important leadership traits and did things very differently from Dr Mahathir; all this explains why till today, Malaysia has been unable to match Singapore's success.
Mr Lee was very clear in setting the strategic direction for Singapore. He wanted a Singapore for Singaporeans. The belief in meritocracy has given every Singaporean an equal chance to be successful, regardless of race, language or religion. Dr Mahathir, on the other hand, promoted a Malaysia for Malays. This prioritised racial redistribution over others has led to the racial problems that have remained unsolved for years.
As a result of giving every Singaporean an equal chance, Mr Lee was able to get a wider pool of talent and place the right person in the right job. This has helped to create not just a strong public administrative body but also a strong private sector which, in turn, helped to attract foreign investments into Singapore.
Malaysia, till today, is still grappling with misgovernance and brain drain.
Mr Lee clearly understood the need to create the right connections and sources to support the successes of the people. Year on year, Singapore has been ranked among the easiest places to do business. The numerous free trade agreements signed with various countries have also opened doors to many untapped opportunities.
Dr Mahathir can maintain that Singapore is successful because it is a smaller country with fewer racial issues and hence, easier to manage.
He must, however, not forget that Singapore has no natural resources and also faces challenges from a multiracial population.
Dr Mahathir was given the authority to run a country with plenty of natural resources and a bigger population, which, presumably, has more talents. Greater successes should be attained. What happened then?
The verdict is out.

","   MALAY and Muslim community leaders yesterday welcomed news of Mr Masagos Zulkifli's promotion to full minister, the first time there are two Malay members of Cabinet.
Mr Masagos, 51, will be sworn in as Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Home Affairs today. He has been Senior Minister of State in both ministries since 2012.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said of his promotion: ""It is the first time we are having two Malay full ministers, which reflects the progress of the Malay community.""
Communications and Information Minister Yaacob Ibrahim, who is also Minister- in-charge of Muslim Affairs, said: ""I am happy that Masagos has been promoted to a full minister.""
Association of Muslim Professionals chairman Azmoon Ahmad said the promotion is further proof that ""Malays can stand tall in this meritocratic nation"".
""It will create impetus for the community and encourage us and give us the confidence that Malays can succeed,"" he added.
Former Nominated MP and political watcher Zulkifli Baharudin said the appointment debunks the long-held idea in some quarters that there could be only one Malay minister. The move shows ""we have moved forward, progress has been made"".
Mr Masagos told The Straits Times that having two Malay full ministers for the first time in the nation's history ""reflects the trust and recognition the Government has on the good progress made by the Malay/Muslim community"".
""However, our value system puts meritocracy above all when appointments are made. That gives us the assurance that appointment is based on merit, not favour,"" he added.
""It's a good system that ensures confidence and respect for whoever is appointed.""
Mr Masagos was chief executive officer of Singtel Global Offices before he entered politics in 2006. He was also a respected community leader, chairing Muslim welfare group Perdaus, and starting its humanitarian offshoot Mercy Relief.
After the 2006 General Election, he was appointed Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Education, and later for Home Affairs as well. In 2010, he was promoted to Minister of State, and the following year, gave up his Education portfolio for Foreign Affairs.
He became Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Home Affairs in August 2012.
Fellow MPs were not surprised at his promotion, citing his diligence and commitment to the job. He has been actively involved in the fight against drugs and extremism, among others. He chairs a multi-agency task force that tackles youth drug abuse, and led a Singapore delegation to the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism in February this year.
His promotion also means there are now two second ministers at Foreign Affairs and Home Affairs.
Mr Hri Kumar Nair, who heads the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Home Affairs and Law, said it was good to have three full ministers for a key portfolio like Home Affairs. He noted Mr Masagos' work in reshaping the rehabilitation systems for prisoners and drug offenders.
Mr Alex Yam, deputy chairman of the GPC for Defence and Foreign Affairs, said as a small country, Singapore placed a lot of emphasis on good relationships with neighbours and partners.
""Mr Masagos has established a wealth of contacts. His role as Second Minister will give additional clout when he negotiates on behalf of Singapore,"" he added.

MERITOCRACY AT WORK
It would seem apparent that the Malay community would celebrate having two full ministers in the Cabinet for the first time, but this is also how Singapore runs on the basis of meritocracy.
That you get the post, and are rewarded for your performance and contributions because of the impact you have made. Not because you are close to a particular person or that you are the son of somebody.
This is important because it gives you the credibility to the people you serve as well as your colleagues. And I'm glad that this is the system that we have.

","   SINGAPORE'S sense of nationhood and unity has never been stronger than in the past weeks when hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans came together to mourn the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, said businessman Ho Kwon Ping yesterday.
But in the next 50 years, post-LKY, the country will be increasingly diverse in ways that run up against rigid expectations of racial and social attitudes.
Singapore's challenge is to embrace this diversity as its strength and as an integral part of itself, said Mr Ho in his fifth and final lecture as the Institute of Policy Studies' (IPS) S R Nathan Fellow.
In his 50-minute address, he examined how this openness and acceptance of Singaporeans who may be different from the mainstream can be a defining characteristic of Singapore's identity.
He said Singapore is ethno-culturally more similar to New York City - where culturally distinct neighbourhoods coexist cheek by jowl - than to the homogeneous cities of Tokyo or Shanghai. ""New Yorkers, for all their amazing diversity, all love their city. Like New Yorkers, Singaporeans must also embrace each other as individuals and not as categories.""
For one thing, the traditional racial categories of ""Chinese, Malay, Indian and Other"" oversimplify Singapore's diversity, he said.
Immigrants or foreign workers from China and India, for example, fall into the Chinese and Indian categories respectively, but hardly identify or interact with Chinese and Indian Singaporeans.
Traditional norms of heterosexuality also do not adequately describe ""people of different LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) affiliations, or alternative family norms such as single or unmarried parents, or same-sex couples"", he said.
Mr Ho suggested abandoning these stereotypes and viewing people as individuals. ""Everyone is unique, everyone is quirky, everyone is rude and kind at different times, and everyone has to simply respect and even appreciate the other's difference.""
In an ensuing hour-long question and answer session, Mr Ho was asked how a diverse society should be organised. He said: ""You cannot change human nature. People find affinity among their own kind... But we should try more consciously to break down barriers to allow people to have more cross-cultural interaction.""
His lecture, attended by about 560 people including civil servants and students, followed four others on Singapore's politics and governance, economy and business, security and sustainability, and demography and family.
Mr Ho also addressed two other social challenges: mitigating divides between different classes of Singaporeans, and having a more collaborative style of governance.
Education reform can help level the playing field and prevent Singapore from ossifying into a static meritocracy with only children from rich families making it to the top. He suggested re-looking the system of priority Primary 1 admissions based on distance from homes, as many elite schools are in wealthy neighbourhoods.
As for having a less paternalistic, more participatory democracy, the Government can involve more civil society activists and citizens in decision-making, and give them information to debate issues.
Closing the event, IPS director Janadas Devan said the next S R Nathan Fellow is Mr Bilahari Kausikan. The Ambassador-at- large will research public policy and governance issues.

ON WHETHER SINGAPORE IS READY FOR A NON-CHINESE PRIME MINISTER
Was America ready for a black president? The jury's out. But I think the fact that America has a black president (for the first time) says a lot for that society...
I actually believe we are ready or will be ready soon. I do not think the Singapore of tomorrow is going to differentiate on the basis of race or colour. They will be, clearly, making differentiations on the basis of views and so on.
However, I'd be also realistic enough to say that if you had two persons of roughly equal calibre and one was Chinese and one was Indian or Malay... you probably have to recognise that there will be racial affinities.
But if a leading party like the PAP were to put up a non-Chinese prime minister, would the country accept?
I think yes.
Would the party lose its power simply because it had a non-Chinese prime minister? I'd honestly believe - and I hope to be naive enough to believe - that if that person was of calibre, we would accept him.
We already have a deputy prime minister who is not Chinese, who is extremely popular. That says something.
RESPONDING TO RESEARCH ASSOCIATE VIGNESH LOUIS NAIDU'S QUESTION ON THE RELEVANCE OF POINTING OUT THAT WITH MR MASAGOS ZULKIFLI'S PROMOTION, THERE ARE NOW TWO MALAY MINISTERS IN CABINET
I do not think it was necessarily bad for the Government to indicate we have now consciously got two Malays in Cabinet.
I think we should blur the CMIO (Chinese, Malay, Indian, Others) categorisation in our own minds and how we define people so that we have more richness of definition of ethnic diversity.
But the danger here, in blurring CMIO, is that it becomes an excuse for a majority race to no longer be cognisant of the fact that minorities have to be very consciously supported in terms of their presence in Cabinet, leadership positions elsewhere and so on.
Because the flip side is to say, race doesn't really matter any more, so does it really matter that we have Malays in Cabinet? No, it does not. Does it matter that we have Malays in Parliament? No, it does not. The fact that they're all Chinese, it's all okay because race doesn't matter any more.
So there's a flipside and a real danger that we must be very clear about.
ON REFORMING THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
We should get rid of the Gifted Education Programme and replace it with a programme that recognises the special needs of every student.
We should create a lot of secondary schools in a geographic area to be a cluster, each encouraged to develop its own area of excellence, (such as in) sports or performing arts.
So students with special needs - we should define special needs as those with special talents and those who have problems like dyslexia or autism - can fulfil their potential.
We should aim to create a system whereby truly we walk the talk and every student who has a potential to be reached - whether it be a talent or a disability - will get that special attention. That's something to be proud of if we can achieve it.

","   Singapore will remain a useful and relevant reference point for China as long as it continues to be a successful and harmonious society that progresses and provides a good quality of life for Singaporeans, said Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.
The Singapore model, embodying principles such as meritocracy, clean governance and self-reliance, is what the Chinese society desires, he added.
""These are the principles which have attracted China to Singapore: that we've been able to create a model in which we have these aspects as well as social harmony and cohesion,"" said Mr Teo, yesterday, commenting on the future of Singapore's ties with China in the post-Lee Kuan Yew era.
Singapore's founding Prime Minister, who pioneered Sino-Singapore ties with late Chinese strongman Deng Xiaoping in the 1970s, died on March 23 at age 91.
A key factor for Singapore's continued success is leadership renewal to ensure new leaders are developed and prepared to take Singapore forward, which is always on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's mind, said Mr Teo, commenting on the Cabinet reshuffle last week.
""The most important thing for any leader is how to make sure we have good strong leadership not just for now but for the future.
""It should be on all Singaporeans' minds too as we're a small country with no resources and only our people to depend on,"" he added.
""There is no reason why we should be successful. Quite a lot of it boils down to our unity and being able to work cohesively to achieve the success that we have.""
Mr Teo was speaking to the Singapore media yesterday as his trip to China, which began last Tuesday, drew to a close.
During his visit, he met top Chinese officials, including Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli and Shanghai party boss Han Zheng, and hosted the fifth China-Singapore Forum on Leadership in central Jinggangshan city.
He also attended the Singapore Day event with some 5,000 Singaporeans in Shanghai.
An example of how the Chinese are keen to learn from Singapore, said Mr Teo, is their reaction to Education Minister Heng Swee Keat's presentation on the 2012 Our Singapore Conversation exercise during a closed-door session at the Jinggangshan forum last Friday.
Mr Heng spoke about how the dialogue fostered communication between the government and the people and also among the people themselves.
He also gave details on how it involved 50,000 people from a broad spectrum, delved deep into issues, and took a long-term perspective by seeking Singaporeans' thoughts on the future.
""What interested the Chinese was how we found a new way of engaging Singaporeans,"" said Mr Teo. ""It wasn't just government-to-people or people-to-government conversation but also a people-to-people conversation in which large numbers of Singaporeans came together to express their views and vision of what they wanted to see in Singapore in the future.""
As both countries mark the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations this year, bilateral cooperation could advance through a proposed government-led project in China's western region and upgrading of the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, he added.

I must confess to some impatience reading such musings on whether Singapore will survive Mr Lee.
The evidence is all around us today. To me, the question is a quarter of a century late.
Mr Lee handed over the prime ministership to Mr Goh Chok Tong in November 1990. He remained in Cabinet, but as he was wont to tell anyone who asked, he was a mere ""data bank"", and later a ""mascot"".
One might contend that while in the Cabinet, he would have held sway over many decisions. At the very least, he might have had veto powers accorded to his years of experience and moral authority.
Even if that were the case, the question of what next after Mr Lee is still four years late because he left the Cabinet after the 2011 election.
In truth, the post-Lee Kuan Yew years for my generation began after 1990. Those born after Independence and who came of age in the 1990s and later have always known a Singapore not led by Mr Lee.
We see the 1990s as Mr Goh Chok Tong's decade, not Mr Lee's.
In like vein, the period after 2004 is defined by the political values of current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his team; PM Lee took over from Mr Goh in August 2004.
The post-LKY years for Singapore thus began after November 1990. The 25 years since have seen an intense reinvention of values of the founding generation led by the senior Mr Lee. Many of the Big Ideas of Mr Lee have been quietly taken apart, and put together in totally new ways.
Let me just cite three.
The first is the move from an ""every man for himself"" society to an inclusive society.
The first PM Lee, bred in the crucible of the Japanese Occupation and the bitter struggle against communalists, communists and colonialists, was very much an advocate of rugged individualism. Each man - and his family - must stand on his own two feet. Welfare is a bad word. Only the indigent get state assistance.
PM Goh's mantra was for a kinder, gentler Singapore. As he pledged in his swearing-in speech, he would aim ""to build a nation of character and grace where people live lives of dignity and fulfilment, and care for one another"".
The current PM Lee, a pivotal member of Mr Goh's team through the 1990s, carried on in that trajectory. He made ""an inclusive society"" the hallmark of his regime.
At first, some thought it was about opening up avenues for the disabled and those with special needs. By now, it has been extended to the elderly (helping them stay employable); to single parents (who can now buy subsidised Housing Board flats); and even to political opponents (no more back-of- the queue treatment for opposition constituencies when it comes to estate upgrading).
Mr Lee Kuan Yew's rugged individual has become a caring citizen looking out for those less rugged than himself.
The second big change post-LKY has been in tempering the relentlessly competitive meritocratic system into one that Deputy PM Tharman Shanmugaratnam termed ""compassionate meritocracy"".
Meritocracy will remain a key lodestar in Singapore. But compassionate meritocracy means not slotting people into rigid academic and socio-economic classes based on their exam results.
Mr Lee had a tendency to ask people their grades; and he famously compared two candidates' O-level exam results (the one who did worse - Mr Chiam See Tong - won the election). He also had an unabashedly Darwinian view of life, believing some people are born smarter than others and if you were a dud, well, only God could help you, he couldn't.
Singapore has moved beyond those values, with an education system that provides many pathways to success, including for the less academically inclined.
The third big shift post-LKY is in the state as provider of last resort, to the state as co-provider when times are bad.
Mr Lee ran a government that intruded into the bathroom (Flush the toilets!), and the bedroom (Stop at two! And later, Have two or more if you can afford it!), but when it came to state handouts or welfare assistance, he favoured a decidedly minimalist government.
The modest Public Assistance allowance was virtually the only form of welfare right into the 1990s, reserved for those too sick or too old to work (often both) and without family support.
Today's Singapore has a thick social safety net to catch those who fall. From ComCare to Workfare, to the Pioneer Generation Package, to ever increasing subsidies for healthcare, childcare, eldercare and home-based care, the Government has been rolling out programme after programme. These days, the middle income and even those with incomes up to the top one-third qualify for various subsidies.
What's remarkable is that the broadening of the welfare state happened while Mr Lee was very much alive; indeed some of it while he was still in the Cabinet. Workfare, for example, began as a pilot project in 2006.
The shift is from viewing government assistance as ""handouts"" (long a dirty word in Singapore) to viewing it as giving people a ""hand up"" when they are down.
To be sure, some of Mr Lee's old ideas look more outdated than others, such as his way of tackling political opponents. But even here, his successors have adapted his methods - from using a bulldozer to using a microscope to scrutinise arguments, as PM Lee once said.
As long as Singapore's leaders and people continue to review guiding principles and policies, discarding those that don't work and updating those that do, the country should retain its solid footing.
Those who speak as if Singapore's success was built by one man do not do the country and its people justice.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew was a key torchbearer, but he was not the only one. Today's citizens and leaders all helped bring Singapore to where it is today. And we are the ones who will carry the torches forward.

","   DECISIONS on how best to honour founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew should not be rushed into so soon after his death, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in Parliament yesterday.
On suggestions to rename Changi Airport after the late Mr Lee or put his image on the local currency, PM Lee said these ideas are good but should not be enacted too hastily.
""We should allow some time to pass, consider the ideas carefully and make calm, considered decisions which will stand the test of time,"" he said. ""Let us take time to consider the best way to honour his memory, in a way that is in keeping with his ideals.""
He reminded the House that Mr Lee disdained monuments and personality cults: ""It was not monuments but ideals that were his chief concern, the ideals upon which he built Singapore: multiracialism, equality, meritocracy, integrity and the rule of law.""
Three MPs had tabled questions for yesterday's parliamentary sitting on ways to honour Mr Lee, who died on March 23.
For now, PM Lee has asked Esplanade chairman Lee Tzu Yang to head a committee to conceptualise a Founders' Memorial that honours not just Mr Lee but also his core team. They included Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr S. Rajaratnam, Mr Othman Wok, Mr Hon Sui Sen and Mr Lim Kim San. Mr Lee was always conscious he did not act alone, but was ""first among equals"" of a multiracial team that complemented one another and trusted one another implicitly, said PM Lee.
The idea of a Founders' Memorial, perhaps coupled with an exhibition gallery to educate future generations, was one Mr Lee himself saw value in, he added.
Last night, Mr Lee Tzu Yang said he was ""honoured and at the same time slightly daunted by this project"".
The former chairman of Shell Companies in Singapore is forming a committee to represent segments of society. He said it will ""consult widely"" in studying and recommending concepts to honour the founding fathers' legacy while inspiring present and future generations.
PM Lee made clear that there was value in suggested moves to honour Mr Lee. Monuments and memorials can be ""a form to focus the mind on abstract ideals, to generate the emotions and to bond people"", he said.
PM Lee, voice breaking with emotion, recalled how different choirsperformed the song Home when Mr Lee's casket lay in state. Nearly half a million people queued for hours to pay respects.
""You need these symbols, these physical things - but (ones) that are full of meaning and not empty, that's what we're looking for,"" said PM Lee.
He pointed to how national memorials in other countries, such as the United States' 9/11 memorial or the one honouring President Franklin D. Roosevelt, took decades to take shape.
The passing of generations is needed for the person's ""historical trace"" to become clear, PM Lee said. ""(It) emerges in sharper focus and we know, if you're only going to do one thing, what is it which you want to do? And then we do that.""
He said whatever is done to honour Mr Lee must be relevant to future generations as well.
PM Lee noted the debate in the US over whether to portray Roosevelt in his wheelchair. Roosevelt hid his disability when he was alive, but attitudes have changed over the decades.
""So for us to think we can settle this within the next few months or few years, I think that is being presumptuous,"" he said.
""If we try to do that, we'd make decisions which, even if we didn't regret it, our children would regret it. And I don't think we should do that.""
He reminded the House: ""We are not canonising a person, we are honouring a human being.""

","   In the wake of Mr Lee Kuan Yew's death, a committee will be convened to conceptualise a memorial to Mr Lee and Singapore's other founding fathers. It will be no easy task.
WHEN epochal leaders die, countries turn to memorials to keep their legacies alive. These grand works of architecture and design then become spiritual centres for a mourning nation, reminders of the values upon which it was built.
Be it the contemplative Abraham Lincoln gazing out onto an American nation ""conceived in liberty"", or the candle in New Delhi that burns unceasingly for Mahatma Gandhi's ideals of peace and non-violence, the most beloved memorials around the world are seen as the better angels of a nation's nature.
In the wake of founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's death on March 23, a clamour has emerged for a public marker to keep alive his life and legacy, both for the Singaporeans who laboured with him in the trenches of nation-building, and the later generations who were born blithe into the fruits of their hard work.
This week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the appointment of Esplanade chairman Lee Tzu Yang to head a committee to conceptualise a Founders' Memorial. It will honour not just the late Mr Lee, but also others in his core team.
But coming up with a concept that resonates with all Singaporeans will be arduous. Public support for the idea is likely to be the only point of unanimity in the journey towards its realisation, as architects, heritage experts and political watchers tell Insight.
If past experience - both here and elsewhere- is any indication, everything from the location and the design to the politics of the memorial will come under intense public debate.
For instance, the iconic Lincoln memorial in Washington DC was erected 57 years after Abraham Lincoln's death - after decades of objection to its location, then a backwater swamp, and its Grecian-style columns, which some saw as unpatriotic.
Expectations for Singapore's proposed Founders' Memorial are high, even before Mr Lee Tzu Yang has assembled his committee. Tampines GRC MP Irene Ng, who wrote a biography of founding Deputy Prime Minister S. Rajaratnam, says: ""For centuries to come, this memorial should be viewed as a symbol for who we are as a people.""
Design dilemmas
BUT it may be an impossible task to please everyone. The where, what and who of memorials have always bitterly divided their publics.
In Singapore, some have already cast their vote for locations to house the Founders' Memorial, such as Marina Bay - the game-changing plot of reclaimed land Mr Lee Kuan Yew had envisioned since the 1980s - or his lifelong ward of Tanjong Pagar.
Others, like architect Chang Yong Ter, feel that Mr Lee's home at 38, Oxley Road is the most fitting site for the memorial - despite Mr Lee's desire to have the house demolished, rather than have it become a ""shabby"" relic.
The modestly furnished pre-war bungalow was the site of many a decision that determined Singapore's very existence, including the formation of the People's Action Party.
""Preserving it would let future generations have a sense of how (Mr Lee) had lived simply despite his extraordinary vision for Singapore,"" says Mr Chang, the principal architect of CHANG Architects. ""Even if the house is demolished, keeping 38, Oxley Road as a monument (site) has more value socially and economically than if it were to become just another condominium site.""
But that location would constrain the size of the memorial. A sprawling space like a park to ""trace the making of a nation (and) capture its trials and tribulations"" has already received the public endorsement of Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.
A related idea to rename the Gardens by the Bay after Mr Lee, most recently advocated by journalism don Cherian George, has received the backing of Gardens chief executive Tan Wee Kiat.
Some experts like the idea of a park because the memorial can then be added to or evolved through the generations, unlike a more static creation of Mr Lee and his colleagues in statue form.
Indeed, a successful memorial is one that brings to life - and keeps alive - a person's ideals and work, says architect Randy Chan of Zarch Collaboratives, citing the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden in the Botanic Gardens, which Mr Chan worked on.
Mr Ballas, a Jewish-Singaporean philanthropist, valued nature and education. The Children's Garden, the first of its kind in Asia, embodies those beliefs in a way that continues to be meaningful to new generations.
But the manifold contributions of Mr Lee and his team defy easy categorisation. They, too, prized nature and envisioned Singapore as a Garden City, but were equally renowned for their governing principles of meritocracy, multiracialism and non-corruptibility.
PM Lee summed up this difficulty in Parliament on Monday, in his response to MP Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar GRC), who had argued that renaming Changi Airport after Mr Lee would be a fitting reminder of how his expensive but farsighted decision to relocate the airport from Paya Lebar showed his determination to take on short-term pain for long-term gain over others' objections.
As PM Lee put it, the late Mr Lee ""had a lot to do with (so) many things (that) if we want to name things after him, there's no shortage of things which are suited"".
As individuals, each of Singapore's founding fathers was also multi-faceted. Mr Lee, for instance, was a tough-as-nails leader who did not shy from the use of methods like detention without trial against opponents. But he was also a devoted and loving husband of 63 years - a softer side of him that touched many Singaporeans.
Emphasising one aspect over another in a memorial is a sure way to court controversy.
In the United States, a bitter battle has been running since 2006 over the memorial for former president Dwight D. Eisenhower, who died in 1969. The memorial's architect, Mr Frank Gehry, inspired by Mr Eisenhower's writings about his ""barefoot boyhood"" full of dreams in Middle America, had planned for a statue of Mr Eisenhower as a boy to take prominence in the structure.
Mr Eisenhower's grandchildren, however, were indignant that such a statue should take centre stage in a memorial for a man who went on to become a fearsome five-star army general and respected president.
""I am not sure if Mr Lee or the founders could be reduced to a central element,"" said Dr Chang Jiat Hwee, an assistant architecture professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
For this reason, he and other observers prefer a more abstract rendering of the founders' ideals. ""A literal statue or sculpture is seldom as evocative or rich,"" he says.
As an example, Dr Chang pointed to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC, which he described as being ""rich with so many layers of meanings that it could be read in many different ways by different 'stakeholders'"".
It features a V-shaped wall, cut into the ground like a wound, on which the names of more than 58,000 wartime dead are inscribed on a mirrored surface that reflects visitors' visages - a symbolic meeting of past and present.
But literal representations can also be powerful ones, whether the sea of red porcelain poppies - meant to evoke bloodshed - around the Tower of London on the centenary of World War II, or the enormous statue of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping posing triumphantly in Shenzhen, the city where he began his free-market experiment to open up what is now the world's biggest economy.
MP Irene Ng envisions part of the memorial bringing alive what she calls ""never again"" moments in Singapore's history, ""like the race riots, the trauma of separation and being left at the mercy of bigger neighbours, and the deep insecurity that came from being defenceless"".
Dr Yeo Kang Shua of the Singapore University of Technology and Design argues similarly for the memorial to give visitors an ""experience"", like Daniel Libeskind's Jewish Museum in Berlin, where visitors encounter three intersecting, slanting corridors which represent the three parts of Jewish life in Germany.
It also has continually changing exhibitions by different artists and curators, which Professor Yeo commends for ""providing multiple narratives on the same subject"".
Making the shortlist
THERE is also the knotty question of which individuals to honour in the Founders' Memorial.
In Parliament on Monday, PM Lee said that the core team of founders included former finance and defence minister Goh Keng Swee, former culture and foreign affairs minister S. Rajaratnam, former social affairs minister Othman Wok, former finance minister Hon Sui Sen and founding chairman of the Housing Board Lim Kim San.
Some members of the public also want to include Dr Toh Chin Chye, the PAP's founding chairman, and former labour and law minister K. M. Byrne, who was responsible for the groundbreaking Women's Charter.
Both men were in Singapore's first Cabinet headed by Mr Lee, as was former education minister Ong Pang Boon. Former law and national development minister E. W. Barker also drafted the documents for separation in 1965.
Then there is the thorny issue that several of the men who helped fight for Singapore's independence, like former chief minister David Marshall and former trade-union leader Lim Chin Siong, were bitter foes of Mr Lee.
""If we are talking about a Founders' Memorial, the difficulty will be in determining who these founders are,"" says law professor Kevin Tan, president of the International Council on Monuments and Sites Singapore.
""This gets us into the victor-versus-vanquished territory. It will be a nightmare and no one will be happy.""
One possible solution is an ""abstract and all-inclusive memorial to include all those who fought for the independence of Singapore, starting with David Marshall,"" says Dr Tan. Even then, he predicts an ""impasse"" with those who would prefer to see Mr Lee featured more prominently.
Making the process count
OBSERVERS say the only way to handle the debate over the memorial is to allow a full and unvarnished airing of differences.
""Good conservation of tangible and intangible heritage requires open engagement, debate, disagreement,"" says NUS heritage expert Johannes Widodo. ""It also requires time over which something will crystallise into reality.""
Experts were unanimous that the design process should be a blind and open one. Anyone should be able to submit designs to be publicly exhibited, but individual designers should not be identifiedso as to avoid any subconscious prejudices.
A similar process led to Ms Maya Lin, then a 21-year-old Asian-American undergraduate, designing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1982. Her race, gender and age were controversial, and some donors pulled their funding after her identity was revealed. But over two decades later, in 2007, the American Institute of Architects ranked the memorial 10th on its list of America's Favourite Architecture.
""The process of deciding the design of the memorial is as important as, if not more important than, the final outcome,"" says NUS' Dr Chang. ""A memorial is frequently a reflection of not just who it commemorates, but also of the society that built it.""
Like PM Lee did in Parliament this week, Dr Widodo urges patience. There should be no hurry to erect the Founders' Memorial in the next few years, he says.
Likening the journey to the public release of classified state documents after 30 years in some other countries, he said the passing of time ""ensures a more objective view towards history"".
""The iterative process will not only strengthen the final product, but also strengthen the democratic principles of a country.""
With a brave and open process, Singapore's Founders' Memorial can join the ranks of beloved national icons everywhere - standing as testament to the nation's best, and a reminder of the greatness that successive generations should strive for.

","   With forces like religious radicalisation and growing diversity posing a risk to Singapore's hard-won social cohesion, the work of building mutual trust between communities must not let up, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said yesterday.
Recent riots in American cities such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, show how ""the breakdown of trust between communities has led to conflict"", he said at the biennial Community Engagement Programme (CEP) dialogue yesterday.
Speaking to an audience of students and community leaders, he said there are people here attempting to incite racial and religious unhappiness, citing online comments around the arrests of three men during the Thaipusam procession earlier this year.
""Some irresponsible persons tried to stir racial and religious sensitivities by spreading falsehoods and rumours online and offline. They made use of something that had happened and stirred things up,"" he said.
""Even though we live in peace and harmony with each other, never for one moment believe that the issues of race and religion will disappear and go away.""
The CEP is a long-standing Government programme to build resilience and social harmony by involving community groups in crisis response plans.
Yesterday's dialogue, held at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, was also attended by Minister for Manpower Lim Swee Say, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong and Second Minister for Home and Foreign Affairs Masagos Zulkifli.
During his opening speech, Mr Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security, pointed to three forces: An open cyberspace, a resurgence of religious radicalisation and violence, and a growing diversity in Singapore.
They could potentially disrupt social cohesion and communal harmony, he said.
According to the Pew Research Centre, Singapore is now the most religiously diverse country in the world. There are now ""new groups who can press their point of view vigorously and sometimes intemperately"", noted Mr Teo.
He proposed two ways to meet these challenges. First, communities must build and sustain trust among one another, which can be done through raising youth awareness as well as continuing to promote inclusivity and meritocracy in the workplace.
Second, Singaporeans must strengthen their social resilience and their ability to respond ""the day after"".
This refers to the social aftermath of a terrorist attack, which experts say can often be more damaging for a society than the attack itself.
The Australians' response to the terrorist attack in Sydney last December, when 150,000 showed their solidarity with the Muslim community though the #Illridewithyou Twitter hashtag, was an example that Singaporeans should learn from, he said.
""Similarly, if an incident were to happen in Singapore, we must pull together as one people, one community and one Singapore.
""This is something we must reflect upon and prepare ourselves psychologically for,"" he said.
In a later session, Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) president Mohammad Alami Musa urged Singaporeans to feel that the religions of others are valuable, in order to ensure that the country does not become more vulnerable to disharmony.
Deepening engagement with other religions will not weaken one's commitment to one's own religion, he said.
""I do not need to hate all other women to love my wife, whom I am happily married to for the last 36 years,"" he quipped as an analogy.
Pioneer Junior College student Lim Yang Lu Regan Edberine, 18, one of the CEP's student leaders, said she shared this sentiment.
""We should recognise our differences, then understand and appreciate those differences, because what makes Singapore special is its diversity,"" she said.

","   As Singapore and the region change, foreign policy will be drawn into domestic political discussions. Singaporeans need to develop common instincts on foreign policy and not be swayed by big powers' attempts to influence views here.
POLITICS in Singapore is becoming more complex.
Basic assumptions and policies are being challenged, not just by opposition parties but also by civil-society groups and ordinary citizens. There is nothing particularly surprising about this. It is a natural consequence of democratic politics and a more educated electorate and we will just have to learn how to deal with it.
Foreign policy, too, will inevitably be drawn into domestic politics. The first signs are clear but not promising. In 2013, for example, an opposition MP who should have known better than to play with fire asked a question about Singapore's Middle East policies that could have stirred up the feelings of our Malay-Muslim ground against the Government. Fortunately, the Foreign Minister could easily demonstrate that the Government had been consistently even-handed in its relations with Israel and Palestine and that the Arab countries understood our position and had no issue with Singapore.
Such irresponsible attempts to use foreign policy for partisan advantage are dangerous. At the very least, they degrade the nimbleness that small states need to navigate an increasingly fluid and unpredictable environment. But they are not the only challenge.
Tussle for influence
IT IS in the nature of international relations that countries will continually try to influence the policies of other countries, openly through diplomacy, but also through other means.
As Singapore's political space becomes more crowded, with civil-society organisations and other advocacy groups as well as opposition parties vying to shape national policies, multiple opportunities will open up for foreign countries to try to cultivate agents of influence. Those targeted will not always be witting.
And try they certainly will.
The United States and China are groping towards a new modus vivendi between themselves and with other countries in East Asia. These adjustments will take decades to work themselves out. Competition for influence will hot up.
The challenge for all countries in East Asia is to preserve the maximum range of options and avoid being forced into invidious choices. Both the US and China say the region is big enough for both of them, implying that they do not seek to make other countries choose. Their behaviour, however, already suggests otherwise.
I doubt they will eschew any instrument in their quest for influence.
As the only country in Southeast Asia with a majority ethnic-Chinese-origin population, and with arguably the most cosmopolitan and Westernised elite, Singapore faces unique vulnerabilities.
Chinese leaders and officials repeatedly refer to Singapore as a ""Chinese country"" and argue that since we ""understand"" China better, we should ""explain"" China's policies to the rest of Asean. Of course, by ""understand"" they really mean ""obey"", and by ""explain"" they mean get other Southeast Asian countries to fall in line.
We politely but firmly point out that Singapore is not a ""Chinese country"".
But China seems incapable of conceiving of an ethnic-Chinese-majority country in any other way. The concept of a pluralistic, multiracial meritocracy is alien to them.
Singapore cannot do China's bidding without losing all credibility with our neighbours and other important partners like the US and Japan. And if we were ever foolish enough to accept China's designation of us as a ""Chinese country"", what would it mean for our social cohesion?
This mode of thought is deeply embedded in China's cultural DNA and will not change. China still has a United Front Work Department under the Communist Party's Central Committee. As China grows and becomes more confident and assertive, this instinct will probably become more pronounced. It would be prudent not to discount the domestic resonance that this could have.
Any attempt to garner influence by one major power will inevitably provoke a counter-reaction from other major powers.
Singapore's brand of democracy already sits uneasily with many in the West and, indeed, with some members of the Singapore elite. In the late 1980s, an American diplomat was expelled for trying, with the support of his State Department superiors, to interfere in our domestic politics by encouraging the formation of a Western-oriented opposition party.
More recently, a European diplomat had to be warned for encouraging some civil-society groups and opposition figures to pursue agendas that he thought were in his country's interests.
Diplomats legitimately meet a variety of groups and individuals - in government, the opposition and in civil society - in order to better understand the countries they are posted to. Our diplomats do so too. But the line between legitimate gathering of information and trying to influence domestic politics is thin. Western diplomacy is infused by a deep belief in the superiority of their values and too often motivated by a secular version of missionary zeal to whip the heathen along the path of righteousness. Some Singaporeans already find it fashionable to ape them; unscrupulous local politicians or ""activists"" may find it convenient to aid and abet them to advance their own agendas.
Neither the Chinese nor the West are going to change their reflexes. We will just have to be alert and firm in dealing with them. An informed public will be less vulnerable to influence by external parties or their local proxies.
Debate informed by realities
BUT most Singaporeans are not very interested in foreign policy, which they regard as remote from their immediate concerns, and do not pay much attention to international developments. When something catches their attention, it is usually only cursorily and superficially.
It is crucial that domestic debate about foreign policy be conducted within the boundaries defined by clear common understandings of our circumstances, chief of which is the inherent irrelevance of small states in the international system and hence the constant imperative of creating relevance for ourselves by pursuing extraordinary excellence.
Countries with long histories instinctively share certain assumptions that bridge partisan divisions. But we are only 50 years old; a mere blink of an eyelid in a country's history.
And even Singaporeans who profess an interest in foreign policy can be breathtakingly naive about international relations and astonishingly ignorant about our own history and the realities confronting a small, multiracial country in South-east Asia.
More than a decade ago, I was infuriated when a journalist - a person whose profession was presumably to inform and educate Singaporeans - told me that there was no ""national interest"". Please note that this was not disagreement over what constituted our national interest in a particular case - it is quite in order to debate this - but over whether there was such a thing at all.
More recently, I was flabbergasted when a Singaporean PhD candidate in political science in a local university asked me why Singapore could not pursue a foreign policy like that of Denmark or Switzerland.
It was quite a struggle to remain calm and reply blandly that it is because Singapore is in South-east Asia, not Europe, and the circumstances of these regions are obviously different.
If a PhD candidate could ask such a silly question, I shudder to think what the average Singaporean understands of our circumstances. It does not help that the political science department in at least one of our universities is staffed mainly by foreigners whose understanding of our region and circumstances is theoretical if not downright ideological.
Knowledge of our history should not be only a matter for specialists. The puerile controversy over the 1963 Operation Coldstore and whether those detained were part of the communist United Front exposed the extent to which the public lacuna of understanding allows pernicious views to gain currency. Historical narratives must, of course, be constantly revised. But critical historical thinking is not just a matter of braying black when the established view is white.
I can understand academics wanting to enhance their reputations by coming up with novel interpretations. But the recent debate over the detentions was more than a mere academic exercise: For some, it was a politically motivated, or at least politically hijacked, attempt to cast doubt on the Government's overall credibility by undermining the Government's narrative on one particular episode in our history.
Young Singaporeans who have known only a prosperous Singapore do not understand how unnatural a place this is; they are sceptical when we speak of our vulnerabilities, regarding it as propaganda or scare tactics designed to keep the Government in power.
In the long run, a successful foreign policy must rest on a stable domestic foundation of common understandings of what is and is not possible for a small country in South-east Asia. This does not yet exist. We have not done a good job of national education. What now passes as national education is ritualised, arousing as much cynicism as understanding. And we are paying the price for de-emphasising history in our national curriculum.
Some steps are now being taken to rectify the situation, including in the civil service which, the foreign service aside, generally has yet to develop sophisticated foreign-policy instincts.
But these steps are still tentative, sometimes executed in a clumsy manner that does more harm than good, and, in any case, will take many years to have an impact on the public's understanding. Social media is a new complication. It conflates and confuses opinion with expertise, and information with entertainment.
Extreme as well as sensible and balanced views can be widely disseminated on social media; indeed, the former probably more widely than the latter because netizens generally find such views more amusing. But foreign policy is no laughing matter.
Or at least it ought not to be, if we are to survive as a sovereign state to celebrate SG100.

","   GLOBAL city leaders at the World Cities Summit Mayors Forum in New York paused to remember the achievements of Singapore's late founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on Tuesday.
At the suggestion of the New York government, the host of the forum, a short tribute video was played during the opening session.
The leaders, from about 70 cities around the world, then gave Mr Lee a hearty round of applause.
In the video, an abridged version of a short film produced for the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, the Singaporean leader can be seen talking about the changes that needed to be made to clean up the Singapore River and turn the city-state into a clean and green city.
United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson then added his own tribute during his opening address. saying: ""When we saw him (Mr Lee), we saw the importance of leadership.""
Minister of State for National Development Desmond Lee, who is chairing the forum, told the gathered leaders that Singapore owed much of its success to the efforts of Mr Lee and the founding generation of leaders, stressing that their greatest contribution was ensuring their efforts would last.
""A small island merely 718 sq km in size, with no hinterland and no resources other than our people, would not have lasted 50 years had it been built only on the strength of individual personalities. Instead, our pioneers had the foresight to create lasting institutions, cultivate leadership continuity and succession, educate our young and imbue values such as integrity, meritocracy, multiracialism, a zero tolerance for corruption, and so on,"" he said.

We need to look at the age-old issue of religious fundamentalism and find better proactive solutions. It is important to understand the psychological and emotional drivers that cause someone to become radicalised.
In the context of Singapore, the proactive solution is to continue to ensure that we build a good foundation of meritocracy and racial and religious harmony, and have laws in place to ensure that respect for different religions and races overrides freedom of speech.
Peace in a country is fragile, and we will need to be vigilant as a community at all levels to ensure that Singapore continues to be a safe and peaceful nation.
Do not let fear of terrorist attacks stop us from continuing our journey in nation building and building our unique value system as defined in our Singapore pledge.

","   A TOP banker has some advice for Singaporeans on the thorny question of hiring locals versus foreigners in the highly competitive financial sector.
UBS Singapore country head Edmund Koh notes that at one time, foreigners were preferred when the Republic was developing as a financial centre.
Now, the push is firmly on to develop a strong pool of local talent.
But locals should prove their worth when seeking positions in the sector that is still dominated by foreigners at senior levels, Mr Koh, 55, said.
""If you go up the hierarchy or seniority, the percentages of foreigners will likely increase...
""But as a financial centre, let's not get too carried away about not hiring foreigners. I'm a Singaporean, and you've got to earn it.""
He firmly believes that ability comes before nationality in filling these positions.
""We (UBS) have come to the state of development in Singapore where we should understand and appreciate meritocracy, so an available position should be open to the most able person,"" said Mr Koh.
He also feels strongly about grooming a new batch of Singaporean bankers who can helm the top jobs.
As newly minted Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say said recently, one of the key areas in his new role is to nurture a core group of Singaporean workers.
Mr Koh added: ""Local banks should, if possible, grow their own talent because it is of strategic interest to Singapore, and is important to groom the future generation that will take Singapore's interests far beyond where we are today.""
Addressing the perennial issue of foreign talent in an exclusive interview with The Straits Times, Mr Koh recalled the ""foreign talent"" policy launched in 1997 to bring in those with expertise.
It was a necessary move as Singapore was building its reputation as a financial hub.
The circumstances may have changed today but ""we should always have the confidence to hire the best... so long as they're here and can contribute to our society and the development of Singapore as a financial centre"", said Mr Koh.
The financial sector makes up about 12 per cent of Singapore's economic output, with more than 1,000 financial institutions and about 190,000 employees, of whom about 70 per cent are Singaporeans.
Mr Koh was a marketing and public affairs manager at HSBCwho moved up the ranks to become DBS Bank's regional head of consumer banking.
He was president of Ta Chong Bank for 31/2 years, where he was credited with making the Taiwanese bank profitable, before being appointed to his current post with UBS in 2012.
But Mr Koh wants to give credit where it is due.
He notes that gross domestic product per capita was $46,000 in 2004, rising to $71,000 last year.
In 2004, the foreign labour force was about 26 per cent.
Last year, it was about 38 per cent.
The labour force grew by about 1.19 million people in that decade, to 3.53 million people, according to Ministry of Manpower figures.
""Look at the GDP and the number of foreigners,"" said Mr Koh.
""The net sum is that they contributed to our growth.
""Let's understand that where we are weak, we learn. If we have to import, we import. But where we are strong, (we) let that grow.""
And UBS has grown its own base of Singapore leaders, such as Ms Tan Min Lan, head of Asia-Pacific chief investment office at UBS wealth management; Mr Kelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer for southern Asia-Pacific; and Mr Gan Seow Ann, vice-chairman of UBS wealth management South-east Asia.
Last week, UBS held a two-day programme for 50 pre-university students in a bid to educate them on banking and finance careers.
At Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore, head of human resources Cara Ang noted that the bank has about 7,000 staff based here, including in country and global roles.
About 7 per cent hold senior management posts - compared with about 6 per cent last year - and of those, more than a fifth are Singaporeans.
Figures at other banks also remained stable over the past year.
At Citi, more than 30 per cent of its Asean management committee members are Singaporeans.
Ms Evangeline Chua, Citi Singapore's human resources head, said the bank works closely with universities to train and groom future bankers.
In Singapore, about 60 per cent of ABN Amro's senior management team are Singaporeans holding regional roles, and the bank's Singapore deputy country executive Daniel Teo believes more Singaporeans will hold senior management positions on a global level over time.
It has often been said that Singaporeans lack the gift of the gab, and Mr Koh concurs.
""Singaporeans are quite shy and not necessarily the best communicators, so sometimes we fail to impress,"" he said.
""It's important that Singaporeans learn the art of communication as well.""
Mr Koh stresses the need to encourage creativity and innovation because even in banking, just relying on the balance sheet is not going to work.
""It's going to take a different educational curriculum and diet that would celebrate in failure sometimes, and understand that is part of learning.""
Mr Koh noted that top bankers, such as DBS Group Holdings chairman Peter Seah, DBS' former senior managing director Tan Soo Nan and CapitaLand chairman Ng Kee Choe, are ""very strong examples of very solid bankers that Singapore has developed"".
He said it takes some 20 years to develop good bankers, and they need international exposure from a young age to learn from the best.
""I think they should at least spend six to nine years, at some point in their career, in a sporadic manner overseas,"" added Mr Koh.
They must go to powerhouse countries such as China and the United States, work in New York's Wall Street, and have short stints in regional countries or emerging markets like Brazil or Myanmar ""where you'll understand the growing stages of development"".
""When you go to these countries, you don't just learn the technical skills or understand the culture,"" said Mr Koh. ""You also go there to broaden your circle of influence and network.""
Mr Koh is confident that Singapore bankers will do well, with many opportunities in the sector.
""The thing is, they must stay the course to be trained and really go through the cycles.
""It's not always about (dealing with clients) but also the discipline in credit risk, operations and technology.""

","   WHILE banks could do more to encourage young people to take on more responsibilities, ultimately, it is talent, rather than nationality, that counts (""How to improve S'poreans' chances of taking top jobs"" by Mr Liu Fook Thim; Wednesday).
This is all the more so because the new generation of workers wants to be treated differently, and their style of working has changed.
It has become an employees' market, and Singaporeans are impatient and eager to climb the corporate ladder, without giving much thought to a progressive rise through meritocracy.
South Korean and Japanese multinational companies used to reserve top posts for their citizens, but this is no longer the case.
Japanese companies such as Sony and Nissan are taking the first steps to hire foreigners for top management positions.
In 2011, the firm with the largest number of foreign professionals in South Korea was Samsung, with 16 foreign executives, followed by LG Electronics, with nine.
These expatriates were recruited for their experience and innovative thinking, to help the companies develop their international presence.
Running a business is about putting the best man in the job, not fulfilling nationality quotas.
The coming year will see a dramatic escalation in the war for talent. The search for talent will rise in the developing world as well as in the rich countries, including Singapore.
In Singapore, our ageing population means that baby boomers in top positions are going to retire, causing companies to lose lots of experienced talent.
Unless our universities have better training schemes, our locals will not be able to compare with expats. Companies will find it hard to get replacements locally, and will have to import foreign talent.
It is time to address the mismatch between what schools are producing and what companies need.
Competition for talent will force companies to cast their nets wider. We must come to terms with this reality as this is what globalisation is all about.

","   MINISTER-IN-CHARGE of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim yesterday brushed aside comments by former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who claimed that Singapore's Malays are marginalised.
Their quality of life and the standard of living today have ""improved tremendously"" compared with 50 years ago, noted Dr Yaacob, who is also Minister for Communications and Information.
""Malays are now home owners, we have a better-educated population and wealth has been increasing in the Malay/Muslim community,"" he told reporters at a Mendaki event.
""So, by and large, I think the state of affairs of the community here is quite good,"" he said.
Tun Dr Mahathir said in a video released on Sunday that if Prime Minister Najib Razak stayed in power, the Malays in Malaysia could become marginalised like their Singapore counterparts.
His claim, an old assertion he resurrected in his campaign to unseat Mr Najib, drew an almost immediate rebuttal from Malaysia's former law minister Zaid Ibrahim.
He said he would be happy if the Malays in Malaysia became like Singaporean Malays, adding that ""Singaporean Malays reap the benefits of the modern advanced economy that is Singapore and are encouraged by political leaders to develop themselves"".
Yesterday, Dr Yaacob noted that the remarks were Mr Zaid's ""own analysis"".
He added that what is most important for him and his community is to be thankful for what they have in Singapore now compared with 50 years ago.
It still faces challenges but the key is in moving forward as a community and as ""a member of the Singaporean family"", he said.
""We preserve what we have, we maintain the standards that we have lived by - meritocracy, corruption-free and so on - to ensure that the succeeding generation can also enjoy a higher quality of life for themselves and their children,"" Dr Yaacob said.

",NA,"   Singapore needs to forge a common identity among its people, so that the country can hold itself together and succeed.
This bond is needed because as Singapore progresses, there is the danger of becoming so globalised that there is no distinctive identity that sets Singaporeans apart from non-Singaporeans.
""If we become so comfortable abroad that we lose the sense that only Singapore is truly home... if a large part of our talent goes overseas seeking challenges or fortunes, then I think we will be depleted, our centre will not hold... we will just melt away, dissolved by globalisation.""
On the flip side, Singapore could be divided along the lines of race, religion and values.
But a unity and common identity can arise when people share values - such as meritocracy, multi-racialism and fairness and justice in society. These bonds are born when they share experiences such as going to schools and national service together, or celebrating successes like the SEA Games.
Overcoming crises such as the outbreak of Sars in 2013, or grieving together at the death of founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, or in the face of tragedies like the deaths of schoolchildren and teachers on Mount Kinabalu last month, also brings people together, said PM Lee.
There will be hard times in the 50 years ahead, but these tests will also be an opportunity for Singaporeans to bond, he said.

But he does not see himself taking on the job, he said when replying to Washington Post columnist Fareed Zakaria, who had asked whether Singapore could see an Indian prime minister.
Mr Zakaria was chairing a dialogue at the SG50+ Conference on what lies ahead for Singapore, organised by the Institute of Policy Studies and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.
INEVITABLE FEATURE
It seems to me inevitable that at some point, a minority prime minister - Indian, Malay, Eurasian, or some mixture - is going to be a feature of the political landscape. We've got a meritocracy, it is an open system.
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM, on a non-Chinese becoming prime minister of Singapore
DPM Tharman, who is also the Finance Minister, said: ""Singapore is evolving. The common space where everyone is growing up in is much larger than it used to be.""
""It is a pretty strong common space, an education system where everyone is educated with first-language English. You go through common experiences together, national service, so it is a matter of time.""
When Mr Zakaria asked if he would do the job, Mr Tharman drew a sporting analogy.
""Let me put it this way. We all have our preferences and I was always, in sports, playing centre-half rather than centre-forward. I enjoy playing half-back and making the long passes, but I am not the striker.
""Unless I am forced to be, and I don't think I will be forced to it because we've got choices. We won't always get it the way we expect it to be, but we think very hard about succession in Singapore.""
He added: ""We've got a crop of people who are in the fray already and entering the fray who will provide future leadership.""
The question of whether and when Singapore may see a minority prime minister has come up in recent years. Days after Mr Barack Obama was elected in 2008, becoming the first black American president, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was asked whether Singapore was ready for a non-Chinese prime minister at a dialogue with Malay-Muslim community leaders.
PM Lee said he thought it was possible for Singapore to have a non- Chinese prime minister, but it may not happen soon. He also acknowledged that attitudes towards race had shifted as English provided more of a common ground.
At yesterday's hour-long dialogue, a member of the audience asked Mr Tharman what he felt were the ""key tenets of a more positive narrative of an ageing Singapore"" and ways to achieve it.
Mr Tharman said his vision for the country 50 years from now is one where people are encouraged, have a passion for learning throughout their lives and can age actively.
And more importantly, to go beyond what Singapore has achieved in multiculturalism.
""The Singapore of the future should be not just about four circles and a common space in between which is neutral... It is also about overlapping circles,"" he said.
""It is having a love for diversity,"" he added, ""not just tolerant of each other, not just accommodating... but something deeper than that.""
""And I think we can achieve it.""
At a later panel discussion, Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh noted that there had not been a Malay president since Mr Yusof Ishak in the 1960s. He asked Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong if a Malay could be elected president.
Mr Goh said making the presidency an elected one did not preclude Malays, but acknowledged that one man, one vote might see the Malay candidate struggling to get elected.
He, however, added that ""if good candidates came along... the time will come when the Malay candidate would be elected"".

","   The Danish physicist Niels Bohr once said: ""Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.""
In discussions about Singapore's political future, the question that seems to be of greatest interest to many people is whether the People's Action Party will still be in power in 50 years.
This is not the question I will try to answer. Instead, it may be more interesting to examine the underlying forces likely to shape Singapore's political evolution over the next 50 years.
In particular, I believe there are at least two driving forces that would critically affect Singapore's politics over the next half-century.
Economy: Concentrated or broad-based benefits
ST ILLUSTRATION: MANNY FRANCISCO
The first is whether the future economy would deliver concentrated or broad-based benefits.
While Singapore's growth in its first 50 years was remarkable - especially the fact that it benefited virtually all segments of society - there are signs that future growth would mainly benefit those with capital and the right technical skills.
The persistent increases in inequality that Singapore experienced over most of the past 15 years are, at least partly, the result of technological advances.
These advances have benefited workers in some sectors - finance and high-tech industries, for example - much more than in others. The advances in a handful of technologies - machine intelligence, the ubiquitous Internet, advanced robotics and big data - are likely to gather speed in the next few decades.
They will produce driverless cars, 3D manufacturing, speech- recognition software, machines that can translate hundreds of languages, mobile health applications that reduce the need for patients to see doctors, massive open online courses that make average lecturers redundant, and many other life-improving innovations.
These innovations will also disrupt labour markets. Dr Carl Benedikt Frey and Professor Michael Osborne of Oxford University recently analysed more than 700 occupations and concluded that 47 per cent of employment in America is at high risk of being automated away over the next decade or two.
While it is premature to conclude that the job losses caused by these technologies will exceed the new jobs created in other parts of the economy, there is growing consensus that the future economy would be characterised by winner-takes-all-dynamics. This means that small differences in performance produces large differences in rewards.
As Professor Tyler Cowen of George Mason University puts it: ""Average is Over."" Prof Cowen describes a future economy stripped of middle-skilled jobs and broad-based prosperity, while a ""cognitive elite"" of 10-15 per cent of the population prosper.
Besides the impacts of technology, the prospects for equitable growth are also likely to be dimmed by our ageing demographics.
As the population ages, the rate of labour force growth slows, and the share of labour income in the economy falls. Capital income - rents, capital gains, interest and dividend income - will take up a larger share of the economy. Since wealth is more unevenly distributed than labour income, its growing role must portend rising inequality.
There are at least two implications for domestic politics.
The first is that the inequality challenge is unlikely to go away any time soon; indeed, it will probably become worse. Future governments would have to contemplate a degree of redistribution not imagined before.
This won't be easy because the inequality that we will experience is exactly what we would expect from a highly meritocratic system.
When inequality is the result of a meritocracy of skills rather than of inherited wealth or privilege, it is much harder to justify why the successful should be taxed more to pay for the needs of the rest. The contest between the right and the left in Singapore - largely non-existent in its first 50 years - is only just beginning.
The second is what rising inequality would mean for political stability. It is tempting to predict that a society riven by sharp disparities in income and wealth would be an unstable one.
While this is plausible, it is by no means a foregone conclusion. Aggressive government redistribution would lessen the risks of conflict significantly, although the feasibility of such redistribution is highly contingent on social trust and social capital.
Greater economic inequality may not necessarily lead to more instability. For one thing, ageing societies tend to be more conservative and, so, less prone to political paroxysms.
Historically, too, the link between economic inequality and political instability has been a tenuous one: mediaeval Europe was quite stable while American society in the late 1960s - the golden age of equality - was in turmoil.
Politics: More contestation
The second critical uncertainty is whether politics in Singapore would be characterised by a pragmatic search for the right policy solutions or a more ""primal"" contest between different value systems.
As with the increasing saliency of inequality as a political issue in the past decade, politics in Singapore in recent years has also witnessed greater contestation between social and religious conservatives on the one hand, and secular liberals and progressives on the other.
Consider the following: the attempted takeover of women's group Aware by Christian conservatives, the parliamentary debate over Section 377A and the subsequent legal challenges, the rise of single-issue interest groups, more organised efforts to improve the treatment of foreign workers and the reactions to the National Library Board's decision to remove books that it felt undermined family values.
All these suggest that politics in Singapore will see more normative conflicts and disagreements based on differences in people's values.
It is true that these issues that proliferated online and off among the middle class may not have had as much resonance among the working masses in the heartland. But it is likely that as Singapore society becomes better-educated and more exposed to social media, such debates will only intensify in quantity and intensity.
Greater contestation over values also reflects the fact that Singapore is now a developed country where most people's basic needs have been met.
A desire among more segments of the population to engage in the political process is simply a new reality that the Government has to adapt to.
The risk for the Singapore Government is that having become used to operating in an environment that was mostly pragmatic and insulated from such value conflicts, it cannot adapt quickly enough to their emergence.
Looking ahead, it is plausible that a sizeable segment of Singapore society, possibly the majority, remains socially conservative and continues to welcome a paternalistic, even moralistic, state to police dominant norms and values, and to preserve the status quo on a wide range of social-cultural issues.
Meanwhile, a growing incongruence between Singapore's aspirations as a global city and its essentially conservative social-political order may produce an increasingly restless and disenchanted liberal middle class.
As evolutionary psychologists have found in recent years, people's political values - whether conservative or liberal - are extremely resistant to change.
As Dr Jonathan Haidt, a moral psychologist at the New York University, observes in The Righteous Mind: ""Once people join a political team, they get ensnared in its moral matrix... They see confirmation of their grand narrative everywhere.""
What this new science of primal politics suggests is that the mostly pragmatic politics of the past 50 years is probably an aberration.
What is unusual is not that these value conflicts are now emerging; it is that we have avoided them for so long. We should now expect them to become more pronounced, salient and contentious.
Political identities
Singapore's political landscape will become more complex and political identities more variegated and fragmented.
One way of thinking about Singapore's political futures is to consider how the two long-term driving forces - economic inequality and primal politics - might interact to shape political identities in Singapore (see table). If we group people by their economic and social values, we might come up with a table like the one shown on this page.
Mainstream conservatives
At the bottom right of the table is an identity associated with mainstream conservatives, who are ""right"" of centre economically and socially. They prefer a government that governs in accordance with free-market principles. They are also socially conservative, preferring to have societies that are bound in tradition (think family values) and maintain the status quo. The current Government is situated here even though it has made recent deliberate efforts to move to the left economically.
Libertarians
The second position is occupied by libertarians, who believe that the state should not interfere in markets or in our personal lives. As our value conflicts become more pronounced, it is conceivable that a party which objects to state paternalism would emerge.
Traditional left-wing
This is the third political identity, consisting of those who favour a highly redistributive state and a progressive social order.
Populists
The fourth political identity refers to those who are economically left and socially conservative. They favour efforts to reduce inequality but seek to maintain existing social mores and hierarchies.
This position may combine traditional family values, a ""pure"" national identity that views immigrants and foreigners as threats, the marginalisation of sexual minorities and antagonism towards existing elites seen to be out of touch with the masses.
For want of a better term, I call them ""populists"" for their anti-elitism and the way they pander to the desire for more redistribution while tapping into primal instincts based on nationality or the exclusion of people who are different. The matrix extrapolates from what has been happening in Singapore.
To be sure, political parties and identities in Singapore can develop along different paths as interests and values shift, and as the relationship between political parties and voters evolve. But one thing seems likely: political identities will become more segmented; political parties will emerge to meet their demands.
The emergence of these competing political identities, and the return of politics to Singapore after 50 years, should not come as a surprise.
Profound economic changes - driven by technological advances and demographic change - combined with the immutability of people's values, suggest that the broad political consensus of the
past 50 years may face real challenges. One of the main tasks facing Singapore governments of the future is to adapt to this more complex and contentious political environment so as to continue governing effectively.

","   National identity is a lot like individual identity: It begins to take shape after birth and continues to form well into maturity.
Singapore's sudden, traumatic birth after separation from Malaysia in 1965, its youth and astounding success have combined to make the question of national identity an especially fascinating one.
The issue has been examined time and again in the pages of The Straits Times: by leader writers and letter writers; columnists and ministers; academicians and foreigners. And by way of interviews and polls, speeches and discussions or just layman comments.
In Singapore's early years, building a national consciousness was no intellectual exercise. It was imperative to the survival of the state. As a deliberate construct, it sometimes tended to be seen as aspirational or even artificial.
In Singapore's early years, building a national consciousness was no intellectual exercise. It was imperative to the survival of the state. As a deliberate construct, it sometimes tended to be seen as aspirational or even artificial.
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew first raised the ""grave problem of identity"" three years after Independence, observing in September 1968 that all new countries faced the problem when an era of stability came to an end.
In Singapore's case, there were added complications. In the first place, Singaporeans did not want to be Singaporean. ""We wanted to be Malayans,"" said Mr Lee. ""Then the idea was extended and we decided to be Malaysians. But 23 months of Malaysia - a traumatic experience for all the parties in Malaysia - ended rather abruptly with our being Singaporeans.""
He also provided an ""emotive definition"" of a Singaporean: ""A person who feels committed to upholding this society as it is - multiracial, tolerant, accommodating, forward-looking - and who is prepared to stake his life for the community.""
The ""idea of Singapore"" as a separate entity took hold by 1970, when The Straits Times reported the findings by University of Singapore sociologists that showed nine in 10 citizens identified with the term ""Singaporean"" rather than Chinese, Malay, Indian or any one race. The study called it ""a shining testimony to a strong feeling of national identity among Singaporeans"". In the ensuing years, a few key words and concepts crystallised in describing national identity or its lack: pragmatism, passion, meritocracy, creativity, materialism, bilingualism and tolerance.
PRAGMATISM VERSUS PASSION
In 1979, physician and social advocate Nalla Tan noted in The Sunday Times that while Singapore had succeeded in forging a national identity to establish itself as a ""self-respecting and reliable society"", materialism and smugness had unfortunately emerged as offshoots. The lack of passion and its cousin, patriotism, also became a concern. But pragmatism, which is antithetical to passion, is one quality Singaporeans felt they had in ever-growing doses.
Mr Lee was close to tears at the 1989 National Day Rally when he spoke of Singaporeans emigrating, a problem compounded by falling birth rates. He urged Singaporeans to ""have the conviction that Singapore is their country and their life... to build a country, you need passion"".
In 1985, a columnist noted that pragmatism had both positive and negative overtones.
It signalled a realistic approach to life but it also reeked of crass materialism.
Still, he added, there were people willing to break the mould, and they had a ""symbiotic relationship"" with the pragmatic majority. The two types would ""always be critical of each other"".

BETTER MACHINES
The purchase of a new rotary press enables The Straits Times to update its traditional short square format into a more modern layout, which has pages two inches longer and slightly wider lines of type. This new machine can print a million newspaper pages, or 40,000 24-page papers an hour. At top speed, it can produce almost 1,400 12-page papers per minute.
The Straits Times' vision of becoming the national newspaper is stated as the tagline ""Malaya's National Paper"" is incorporated into the masthead.

THE GENERAL ELECTION
Labour Front leader David Marshall emerges as the winner of the 1955 general election, though The Straits Times, like the rest of the business community, supported the Progressive Party, which it views as most able to provide stability and economic balance in the lead-up to internal self-government.

231,"Most said self-interest was the strongest motivating factor for serving NS because they were committed to defending ""the Singaporean way of life"", which included ""the food, the shopping centres, East Coast Parkway and Orchard Road"". The commentator observed a tendency to equate patriotism with loyalty to the People's Action Party (PAP): ""Singapore is a young nation that has had one strong governing voice - that of PAP, which has made a modern miracle out of an insignificant dot on the map.
",232,NA," Jul 15, 2015
"," Home
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Colleges & universities; Patriotism; National identity; Pragmatism
","   The conflict between pragmatism and passion was best exemplified in the divergent career paths taken by young Singaporeans.
In a 1994 address to National University of Singapore graduates, businessman Ho Kwon Ping observed that while ""the best social engineers will be our technocratic high-fliers, the soul of Singapore will be shaped by... those who are willing to take artistic risks, career risks, intellectual risks"".
The ruling ethos of pragmatism was also seen as inhibiting romance and courtship in a society with falling birth rates.
A 2006 report on Valentine's Day memorably described romance in Singapore as ""seasonal, consumerist, functional and in denial"". The report described, somewhat unkindly, the local variant of the conventional marriage proposal, ""Shall we get married?"" as ""Shall we get an HDB flat?""
Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts Lee Boon Yang struck a similar note in 2006. There was no need for Singaporeans to be anxious about creating a national identity quickly, he said. It would evolve naturally over time.
While an academic warned that ""pragmatism can easily degenerate into an unthinking mindset"", a columnist attributed the lack of ""great"" individuals in Singapore to a ""no-nonsense approach to life"".
An elevated form of pragmatism also seemed to be at play for young men serving national service (NS), as indicated in a 1982 Defence Ministry survey.
Most said self-interest was the strongest motivating factor for serving NS because they were committed to defending ""the Singaporean way of life"", which included ""the food, the shopping centres, East Coast Parkway and Orchard Road"".
In the new millennium, the debate assumed more nuance. In 2002, a Straits Times commentary argued that there was a need to separate politics from country when it came to defining patriotism and duty.
The commentator observed a tendency to equate patriotism with loyalty to the People's Action Party (PAP): ""Singapore is a young nation that has had one strong governing voice - that of PAP, which has made a modern miracle out of an insignificant dot on the map. So for many, patriotism to Singapore equals patriotism to PAP.""
As an idea, meritocracy is perhaps the component most baked into national identity. It has been emphasised as a key tenet of policy since independence as the lack of natural resources makes the development of human resources paramount.
In 1981, Trade and Industry Minister Goh Chok Tong expanded the meaning of the term. He noted that meritocracy had been misunderstood by being equated with individual ability, regardless of the ability to work in a team.
""In our definition of meritocracy, we must give double weightage to a person's ability to mobilise all concerned behind a common goal.""
Singlish, Singapore's edition of English, is another facet in the Singapore identity. Its usefulness, however, is limited for pragmatic reasons.
A 1985 column noted that Singlish was tied to the national identity ""like the smell of durian - a true child of Singapore would recognise it anywhere"".
In 1992, The Straits Times examined both sides of the debate. Though it concluded that Singlish was not ""bad English"", the newspaper still pointed out that its widespread use on mainstream broadcast channels would make things difficult - and confuse those who could not speak proper English.
""Do we really want to promote a sub-language that may be culturally unique but is, in fact, a handicap to people who cannot switch naturally to standard English when engaged in conversation with those who do not speak the Singapore patois?"" the writer asked.
In 1999, an Education Ministry report warned against its use, saying Singlish could erode students' competence in English.
A well known academic has posited that resilient ethnic cultures were helping to shape the national identity in unique ways.
In a commentary last year in The Straits Times, Professor Wang Gungwu, chairman of the National University of Singapore's East Asia Institute, drew an intriguing line between identity and ""cultural resilience"" of ethnic groups.
He contended that a recent surge in interest in heritage issues was a sign of local cultures responding to national and global forces. In a migrant community like Singapore, local cultures that draw on ancestry do not merely survive, but are ""badges of pride"", an embodiment of ""cultural resilience"" in a bewildering, fast-changing environment.
Accomplished and confident, Singapore's young women are shaping the Singaporean identity while being shaped by it.
In 2002, a columnist defended the perception of Singaporean women as being ""fierce"" and made no apologies for the lack of submissive, feminine behaviour. She contended that the Singaporean woman was shaped by her society, its competitive nature, emphasis on education and merit.
She was ""pragmatic and hence, materialistic""; she ""goes out to work and tries to excel in her career, and is ""frank and has no time for mind games"".
With the large number of foreign residents becoming an issue, a Straits Times reader gave an interesting take on citizenship in 2012.
The reader's letter in the Forum page decried reducing citizenship to its perks. ""The insistence on citizens' privileges is not patriotism, and reduces citizenship and national identity to the value of its perks, somewhat like a club membership"".
Sociologist Tan Ern Ser noted in a comprehensive 2012 report that the 2011 watershed general election gave netizens an opportunity to air views on Singapore that drew a distinction between love for the country and support for the government in power.
The findings showed Singaporeans' strength of emotional attachment to Singapore had been remarkably stable and healthy in the past two decades.
""Singapore is at the threshold of a defining moment in its history when the people are rising to take ownership of its destiny, while state paternalism makes way for state-people partnership, armed with a strong sense of national purpose.
""This will produce a patriotism which is more than just about love of food, place, family and friends, but extending into the realm of a national community where the people can be counted upon to stick with it through thick and thin"".
Perhaps one of the most insightful observations on national identity was made more than 40 years ago by one of Singapore's founding fathers Goh Keng Swee. In 1973, he suggested that ""the true Singaporean"" would emerge from generations of Singaporeans sharing the common experience of national service.
Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts Lee Boon Yang struck a similar note in 2006. There was no need for Singaporeans to be anxious about creating a national identity quickly, he said. It would evolve naturally over time.
What does it mean to be Singaporean today, as National Day 2015 nears?
Is there a way to measure passion? Pragmatically? And so the quest continues. - ST

FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
Reacting to a Straits Times report that addresses the sensitive issue of merger between Singapore and Malaya, Mr Lee Kuan Yew warns on May 18 that ""any newspaper that tries to sour up or strain relations between the Federation and Singapore will go in for subversion"".
The Straits Times takes the case to the International Press Institute (IPI) in West Berlin and warns of a serious threat to the freedom of the press in Singapore. IPI carries out an investigation and concludes that both sides had over-reacted.
The PAP goes on to secure a clear victory in the election, sweeping 43 out of 51 seats in the new legislative assembly.
The Straits Times moves its headquarters to Kuala Lumpur, judging it would have more operating room there.

He was unsure what to do with his new press, and was persuaded to use it to set up a newspaper.

So, quite by accident, the first issue of The Straits Times appeared on July 15, 1845.
Fast forward 170 years, and the broadsheet has endured the times. It has seen world wars, changes in political leadership, technology and even its own name.
At one point, in 1858, the paper was known as Singapore Daily News, before the name was scrapped in 1883.
The newspaper will tell the Singapore story through an exhibition of its stories and photographs that opens on Friday at the ArtScience Museum, as part of celebrations to mark its 170th year.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will today officially launch the exhibition, called Singapore STories: Then, Now, Tomorrow.
The exhibition will be open to the public from Friday to Oct 4, and is the first one at the museum that is free to the public throughout its entire duration of 11 weeks.
At a press launch yesterday, ST editor Warren Fernandez said the paper had ""survived and thrived"" through the years of change. ""It saw wave upon wave of technological change, from the telegraph, the telephone, the television, and now the Internet,"" he said. ""This is a story not just of the history of The Straits Times, but also the history of Singapore as told by the pictures and pages of this newspaper.""
""We have had a lot of focus on SG50,"" he added, pointing to celebrations to mark Singapore's golden jubilee this year. ""This exhibition pulls back the lens and showcases the last 50 years, set against a longer history.""
The six-member curatorial team behind it comprises Straits Times Press general manager Susan Long, the newspaper's picture editor Stephanie Yeow, chief photographer Joyce Fang, arts correspondent Huang Lijie, ArtScience Museum executive director Honor Harger and curator Julia Vasko.
CapitaLand is its presenting sponsor. Standard Chartered Bank is a gold sponsor and Best Denki is the equipment sponsor.
Ms Harger said: ""As you walk through the pages of the newspaper... you'll find the genesis of ideas and policies which have become so familiar to us today.""
These include principles of egalitarianism and meritocracy, she said.
Instead of going by chronological order, the exhibition gives visitors a taste of Singapore through themes, according to the sections of this newspaper.
The first stop is the Business gallery, reminiscent of The Straits Times' origins as a paper that started off with reporting on commerce here and the region.
Photographs and news about Standard Chartered Bank are featured in the gallery, from its opening in 1859 here to being the first merchant bank here in 1970.
Mr Neeraj Swaroop, chief executive of Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore, said it was proud to be a part of the exhibition.
He said: ""While we are headquartered in London, we employ about six times the number of people in Singapore than we do in London; so for us, Singapore is kind of home.""
The Home section features reports on housing, education, transport, defence, health and environment issues.
The World gallery charts Singapore's relationships with the world, from being a British colony to joining Malaysia.
Sports highlights include initiatives such as the Great Singapore Workout, a nationwide aerobic routine in 1993, while Life looks at food, fashion and the arts.
Forum, the last gallery, showcases ideas for the future, a result of CapitaLand's crowdsourcing campaign earlier this year. Many ideas in this gallery involve using technology to meet needs such as housing and transport.
Mr Lim Ming Yan, president and group chief executive of CapitaLand, said it wanted to hear from Singaporeans their ""dreams and aspirations for the future"".
Ms Harger added: ""This is a nation that always has one eye on the future. It's very appropriate that we end the exhibition in the future.""

","   The end of Ramadan this year comes as Singapore marks an important milestone, and the Muslim community has every reason to be confident of a brighter future, said Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim.
In his Hari Raya Aidilfitri message to Muslims yesterday, he noted that the community had progressed alongside the country and contributed to the nation in the past 50 years.
""We have come a long way since Singapore's independence,"" he said. ""Perils abounded in that turbulent era, but together, we overcame our challenges.""
Dr Yaacob, who is Minister for Communications and Information, noted that Singapore as well as his community have built strong institutions founded on the values of integrity, meritocracy, equality of opportunities and multiculturalism.HARI RAYA GREETINGS
- The Prime Minister wishes all Muslims Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri.
- The Straits Times wishes all Muslim readers Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri.
""Our leaders continue to work hard to ensure that we remain a fair and inclusive society, by empowering Singaporeans and supporting their aspirations.""
Over the month of Ramadan, Muslims showed greater spiritual devotion and stronger community spirit - in many cases breaking their dawn-to-dusk fast with neighbours and friends of various faiths.
Dr Yaacob also said that though trials lie ahead as Singapore moves past its 50th year, ""there is every reason to be sure of a brighter future, as long as we stand together as one united Singapore"".
""During Ramadan, our mosques, organisations and homes were open to all, reflecting the quiet confidence of our community, that we are thankful for what we have, and that we share what we have with everyone else.
""This is the spirit that will carry our community forward into the future, confident that we can navigate the uncertainties together, assured that the future is ours to make, and happy that Singapore remains the best home for our families and community.""
People from all walks of life - from imams, cabbies and philanthropists to students and housewives - had chipped in to make this Ramadan special, the minister said.
He was also heartened to see many groups, especially the young, stepping up to help those in need, and in particular, the SG50 Kita committee which organised a Service to the Nation Week during Ramadan. The committee, which coordinates the community's SG50 celebrations, brought together mosques, community groups and volunteers to reach out to others through activities such as sprucing up the homes of needy families.
In sending his and his fellow MPs' greetings for the occasion, Dr Yaacob also urged all Singaporeans to come together ""to chart an even better future"".

","   The issue of political representation from a broad perspective is worth pondering as the next General Election is obviously on the cards - from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's announcement in Parliament last week that the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee had been formed two months ago. Opposition parties have criticised Mr Lee's decision to disclose the committee's formation only two months later, even though everyone knows no formal announcement of the committee is required at all. Talk of a possible election soon after Singapore's Golden Jubilee celebrations has been rife for many months, so no one can claim to be taken by surprise if and when this happens.
Of course, what matters more is what the report says and the date of its release, as that would set in motion the tactical manoeuvres for the polls. These include concentrating political resources appropriately by choosing whom to field where. The committee's remit - to consider population shifts and housing developments since the last exercise in 2011 - is theoretically broad enough to offer all parties an opportunity to harness demography to their advantage. In practice, voter cynicism could arise if the redrawing of boundaries to fix demographic anomalies seem to coincide too neatly with seats with razor-thin voting margins for the ruling party.
There are larger issues, too, like the nature of representation and the key roles of MPs. Mr Lee asked the committee to reduce the average size of a Group Representation Constituency to below five members, and to have at least 12 Single Member Constituencies. Since their introduction in 1988, GRCs have contributed to ensuring that a minimum number of representatives from the minority races is present in Parliament. However, big GRCs are not only unwieldy administratively, but they also restrict political choice potentially by obliging voters to elect a large number of candidates together. Not all of them might have enjoyed individually the vote that a GRC gives them collectively. Another argument that has been raised is the difficulty of voters in identifying with their MPs when the team is too large. Having smaller GRCs would preserve the scheme's multiracial rationale while giving voters more choice. A larger number of SMCs would reaffirm a balance between overarching national imperatives, such as multiracialism, and a keener exercise of choice.
Ultimately, elections are a means to renew a government's mandate to implement policies that fulfil national goals. No matter how a party fares, what is essential is that Singapore's interests are upheld. Multiracialism and meritocracy are inextricable parts of a national whole that includes an economy capable of underpinning the material needs of the people and a polity that can answer to their social aspirations.

","   I believe that Singaporeans of diverse backgrounds will accept a non-Chinese prime minister in the near future (""Singapore could see a non-Chinese PM""; last Friday).
Singaporeans have come a long way since Singapore became a republic in 1965, upon its secession from the Federation of Malaysia.
Our first president was a Malay, Mr Yusof Ishak. He was followed by a Eurasian, Dr Benjamin Sheares. We also have two presidents of Indian origin: Mr Devan Nair and Mr S R Nathan. All of them served our nation well, and were held in high esteem by Singaporeans of different races and religions.
Singaporeans are becoming more colour-blind, and this is evident in both the government service and the corporate world, where many non-Chinese hold key positions even in predominantly ethnic Chinese business organisations.
This state of affairs augurs well for the future and helps reinforce Singaporeans' desire for meritocracy and a sense of unity, which is the cornerstone of our strong multiracial society.
Singaporeans are becoming more colour-blind... This state of affairs augurs well for the future and helps reinforce Singaporeans' desire for meritocracy and a sense of unity.
It will be a national loss if capable and dedicated people are deprived of the chance to serve in the highest office of the land just because they are from a minority race.
Therefore, all Singaporeans, regardless of race and religion, should work towards a true Singaporean identity and the improvement of our society. This is achievable only in a colour-blind environment.

"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Leadership
","   Born 18 years apart in 1947 and 1965, Pakistan and Singapore share August as their independence months - Aug 14 and Aug 9, respectively.
At Singapore's independence, Mr Lee Kuan Yew teared up when his belief of ""merger and the unity of the two territories (Singapore and Malaysia)... people connected by geography, economics and kinship"", collapsed.
Like Singapore, Pakistan is an ""accidental nation"". The establishment of Pakistan was also an anti-climax in terms of founding father Mohammad Ali Jinnah's political philosophy. Characterised earlier as ""the ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity"", subsequently compelled towards independence, he had accepted to remain in ""united India"" as late as 1946.
Pakistan and Singapore, born out of mother nations - India and Malaysia - amid bitterness, both faced hostility in the neighbourhood. Pakistan, instead of taking advantage of its location at the crossroads of three sub-regions of Asia, has remained mired in conflict, leading to economic and social degradation. Singapore, through deft policy choices, has turned inadequacies of size, location and resources into advantages.
At 50, Singapore is undergoing deep introspection as to what needs to be done to remain ahead of its peers. Facing existential threats, deeply in debt, Pakistan foolishly believes that its ""greatness"" is preordained.
Both are nations of immigrants and their successors. Singapore's National Pledge - to build a society based on justice ""regardless of race, language or religion"" - instils tolerance and respect among communities. It is the bedrock of Singapore's excellence at SG50.
Pakistan chose to disregard these fundamentals. Its short-sighted policies on language laid the seeds of its dismemberment as early as 1948. Minorities that constituted over a quarter of its population in 1947 are now down to less than 5 per cent. And religion has become the most divisive force in Pakistan.
The partitioning of the Indian sub-continent and of the Malaysian peninsula has had opposite effects. In addition to dividing the country, the Indian partition tragically divided people who had lived in harmony for centuries. The division of the Malaysian peninsula arguably improved relations between communities living amid fear of race riots. Consequently, India and Pakistan are enemies, while Singapore and Malaysia are engaging fruitfully, both bilaterally and within Asean, for the betterment of the people.
Pakistan was unlucky with its leadership longevity. Founding father Jinnah, a brilliant attorney who loved Bombay - now Mumbai, where his family lives - died an unhappy man in the mayhem that partition created 13 months after Pakistan was founded in 1947. His lieutenant, Pakistan's first prime minister, Mr Liaquat Ali Khan, was shot three years after Mr Jinnah's death.
Beginning with a collegial group of dedicated men, Mr Lee made sure Singapore was ready with a credible team among whom one could succeed him, so that the country would be governed under the highest standards.
Preparing future leaders is the hallmark of visionary leaders. ""I have done my job. I found a successor and handed over to another generation,"" Mr Lee once said. ""Tell Musharraf to prepare for succession,"" is the only message that Mr Lee pointedly wanted me to convey to then President Pervez Musharraf, when I met him for the first time in 2004 after assuming my post in Singapore. In 68 years of history, Pakistan has had only one ""normal"" power transfer.
One key element of Singapore's success is corruption-free governance. Ranked No. 7 among 174 countries surveyed by Transparency International (TI) last year, Singapore's government remains one of the cleanest in the world.
In Pakistan, nearly all of the government's financial dealings are opaque, raising serious questions about leadership credibility. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif obviously chose to disregard the advice Mr Lee gave him during the early 1990s on the need for responsive public policies, transparency and clean government, so goes a story in Pakistan's Foreign Office. No wonder TI placed Pakistan among the very corrupt nations, at 126.
Meritocracy remains fundamental to Singapore's excellence. Mr Lee and his core team nurtured the best talent available, both for politics and in public service. These people help Singapore to keep its edge.
In Pakistan, politics is hereditary and a business; bureaucracy is highly politicised in a system unresponsive to public needs and is, therefore, dysfunctional.
The contrast between the two countries with many similarities is best summed up in the words of former president S R Nathan: ""Your country has to be a great opportunity or a serious problem if you are to get attention.""
Singapore chose to be a ""great opportunity"", while Pakistan remains a ""serious problem"".

","   Raffles Institution (RI) is a ""middle- class"" school that now largely caters to the affluent segment of the population. It also risks becoming insular, cocooned by the glowing list of academic and sporting achievements its students have racked up year after year.
These harsh words came from the school's own principal, Mr Chan Poh Meng, in a speech delivered in front of hundreds of current and former RI staff and students.
Speaking at the school's 192nd Founder's Day ceremony about a week ago, Mr Chan, who took over as RI principal at the end of 2013, said the school has been accused of being elitist, a charge he did not deny. He is himself an old boy of RI.
Singapore, on the eve of its 50th birthday, has been successful, building up a system that is admired the world over. But fissures have erupted in the process, one of which is the faltering meritocracy that the country has been lauded for in the past.
""Our system of meritocracy is working less well than it used to, two generations in,"" he said.
CURRENT REALITY
""A long period of conditioning means that we often fail to see elitism even when it is staring at us in the face. RI has become a middle-class school - that is the current reality.""
MR CHAN POH MENG, principal of Raffles Institution
Wealthier families have been able to give their children an edge through tuition and enrichment, leading to exams such as the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) no longer being ""the level playing field that they once were"", he added.
For RI, the school is no longer what many alumni remember it to be in the past, with many students coming from diverse family and socio-economic backgrounds. Today, it ""can no longer afford the comfortable illusion that RI is truly representative of Singapore"", Mr Chan told the audience of 1,400 students, alumni, teachers and parents.
RI, widely considered the most prestigious school in Singapore, has long prided itself on its students' academic prowess.
""For a long time, we have measured our success by how high our PSLE cut-off and how low our L1R5 were. By how many Olympiads and competitions and tournaments we won... By the number of 'top' scholarships and places in the Oxbridge and Ivy League universities (students) secure,"" said Mr Chan.
But he questioned if pride in such achievements may have had negative side effects, making RI ""insular - a school unto ourselves"".
""A long period of conditioning means that we often fail to see elitism even when it is staring at us in the face,"" he said. ""RI has become a middle-class school - that is the current reality. What matters more now is what we do with this reality and this knowledge.""
To this end, Mr Chan challenged students and staff to make RI a better school for Singapore, and not just for itself.
He set guiding principles for the school, emphasising that it must do its best to maintain the socio-economic diversity of its student population and reach out to the community with more purpose and heart.
He cited examples of recent initiatives undertaken by RI students and staff that have served society.
One was The Golden Page, a project started last year by student volunteers to improve the living conditions of the elderly by installing equipment such as ramps and handle-bars in their homes.
Several alumni have also raised funds for scholarships for students from lower-income families.
RI must lend a hand to people who need help, such as foreign workers, the elderly and the poor, said Mr Chan. ""I put it to you that this is our wider duty to Singapore in 2015 and beyond - to serve as a social glue between parts of the community that have little or no contact with each other.""

",NA,"   Singapore's success was built on its founding fathers' governing principles of ""excellence, meritocracy, pragmatism and incorruptibility"", National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said yesterday as he called on the country to build on this legacy for a ""brighter future"".
He said during his ministry's National Day observance ceremony at the Jem office tower in Jurong East that the Republic needs good leaders and a seamless public service that consults its people when formulating policies.
""We owe what we have to our pioneers,"" said Mr Khaw, referring to late leaders such as Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr S. Rajaratnam and Mr Lim Kim San.
""We are reaping the fruits of their efforts and sacrifice.""
He lauded their contributions in transforming Singapore through efforts such as cleaning up the Singapore River and resettling slum residents into Housing Board flats.
Mr Khaw also thanked pioneers from the construction industry for helping to build the country.
A group of 17 of these builders were present at yesterday's event, including two retired Samsui women - Chinese labourers who wore red cloth hats in the earlier days.
One of them, Madam Ng Moey Chye, 83, recalled working 12-hour days, carrying cement and bricks for just $3 a day.
""It was not easy earning a living then. Work was tough, just look at my hands,"" she said, stretching out her rough, wrinkled palms.
""A lot has changed. Now there are machines to help with the building. We used to worry about not having enough to eat, now we talk about nourishment and eating well.""
Mr Khaw presented the biennial Minister's Team Award to 15 projects helmed by his ministry's agencies. The award recognises team-based projects that are considered significant and innovative.
He also launched 50 Years of Transforming Our City, Our Home, a Ministry of National Development (MND) exhibition showcasing milestones in Singapore's urbanisation and public housing journey over the past 50 years.
The roving exhibition, now at Jem's Level 6 foyer, will pop up at six other locations including the MND Complex in Maxwell Road, where it will be located permanently from December.

"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Presidents; Prime ministers
","   Singapore awoke to a rude shock on Aug 9, 1965.
At 10am, a voice on the radio revealed that the city state had been turfed out of the Malaysian federation and would ""forever be a sovereign, democratic and independent nation"".
The headline in The Straits Times, the following day (see page below), summed it up simply: ""Singapore is out"".
The city state had been expelled unceremoniously, cast adrift, bereft of any hinterland, and faced an uncertain future.
Even the redoubtable Prime Minister then, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, famously wept at this ""moment of anguish"" at his first post-independence press conference that day.
Reflecting this sombre mood, ST's front page editorial decried the ""tragic news"" as a ""cruel shock"", which was ""sad beyond words"".
Few believed the separation could be a lasting solution; many thought Singapore would have little choice but to return to the Malaysian fold, when economic realities kicked in. There were fears that ethnic ties, fraught and fragile, might fray, or worse, flare up in violence.
The editorial's conclusion was striking: ""In time, it is to be hoped that the wounds will heal and the logic of Malaysia, unimpaired in its fundamentals, will reassert itself.""
But 50 years on, how alien, even odd, those sentiments might seem to a younger generation of Singaporeans. Today, as Singaporeans mark SG50 - their unexpected, improbable nation's Golden Jubilee - not many continue to view Aug 9 as a ""moment of anguish"".
Fifty years ago, the new-found Republic had no army to defend its new-found independence. This weekend, families braved the rains to watch the dazzling display of aerial acrobatics by the country's very own Black Knights.
Fifty years ago, the top concerns were over high unemployment, low literacy and a shortage of housing for those who lived in slums. Today, the news is dominated by reports of sky-high property prices, tight labour markets, and how Singapore sends more students to top universities like Oxford and Cambridge than any other country outside Britain, apart from China.
Alluding to this transformation in his National Day message last night, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted how Singapore had turned ""that moment of anguish into a lifetime of determination to forge a path for this island nation"".
PM Lee also recounted how Mr Lee Kuan Yew had pledged in 1965 to build a model multiracial nation in Singapore.
""He said: 'We will set an example. This is not a Malay nation; this is not a Chinese nation; this is not an Indian nation. Everyone will have his place, equal: language, culture, religion.'
""From that break, we began building a nation. And what a journey it has been. It started with the first generation of leaders convincing our pioneer generation that Singapore could succeed as a sovereign country. Together, leaders and the people - the lions and the lion-hearted - fought with unwavering determination to secure our foundations. After them, younger generations picked up the baton and took Singapore further...
""Year after year, we have kept the promises that Mr Lee Kuan Yew made on the 9th of August 1965: that we will be 'one united people, regardless of race, language or religion'; that we will always have a bright future ahead of us.""
There will be much sadness, perhaps even some tears shed, that Mr Lee did not live just a little longer to savour and share the joyous celebrations with the people he inspired and led to today's Singapore.
Yet, ironically, the outpouring of national grief that welled to the surface following his passing in March did more than anything else to remind Singaporeans what this year-long jubilee jamboree was all about. The way Singaporeans responded during the week of national mourning for their founding father made one thing plain to everyone, here and abroad: the idea of Singapore, and the principles that led to it becoming an independent nation - multiracialism, meritocracy, equality before the law, as well as honesty, integrity and efficacy in government - has become ingrained in the people's hearts and minds.
Singapore is out? No actually, the events of the past months, and decades, have shown that Singapore is in.
Fifty years on, Singaporeans today look to their shared past and collective future with pride, and a growing sense of national identity, more than anyone had ever imagined.
Similarly, around the world, the little red dot is no longer viewed as an economic and political non-starter. Rather, the Republic is respected not just for the economic miracle that transformed the city, but also the doggedness of its people to constantly strive to stay ahead and remain relevant to the world.
Concluding his message, delivered from the newly refurbished Victoria Concert Hall, PM Lee noted that it was there that his father and his colleagues launched the People's Action Party and its long struggle for a fair and just society.
""It was here in 1958 that Majulah Singapura was first performed. It was at the Padang nearby, after independence, that we held our National Day Parades, and sang Majulah Singapura together as a nation.""
Former art teacher Wong Hiong Boon, 83, recalls in a 52-page National Day special (which comes with your paper today), the emotions he felt when he sang that anthem for the first time on Aug 9, 1965.
""We didn't have the British. We didn't have Malaysia. We were alone and scared. Could we survive by ourselves? Majulah Singapura told us we, the 'rakyat', the people, could... It was the first song we could call our own. It was the first national anthem I sang with so many feelings. It gave us courage and hope.""
Today, that same anthem will sound around the island, at a host of community events culminating in a grand parade at the Padang.
The new spirit - or semangat yang baru - that it extols might be taken to reflect the remarkably changed sentiments, both at home and abroad, towards Singapore, its people and their prospects. Today, no more tears are shed, nor is there shock or grave fears aroused, at the thought that ""Singapore is out"", because, put simply, Singapore is in.

","   A writer suggests that elitism is a natural consequence of meritocracy, and that we should pursue equity rather than equality. Do you agree? Why or why not?
Meritocracy is a system. Elitism is the attitude and behaviour. Don't mix them up.
- MJ Rina Huang
Elitism has always been around, whether we like it or not... Good for the society? I am not very sure by what measure to say it's good. To me, as long as one contributes to the good of society, rich or poor, that is good enough.
- Peter Yeo
Meritocracy aims to promote the pursuit of excellence, not elitism. A highly regarded leader would want to foster equality in treatment for all while giving opportunities to those who excel above the rest. Being elitist without empathy for the diverse community we all share plainly demonstrates one's shallow and selfish thinking.
- Yvonne Wong
What are Singapore's core values? Are there any which are lacking in our society?
Maybe we should add empathy as part of our core values. With the rise of the middle class in Singapore, it is worrying that future generations might lack empathy towards others, especially poor people and the needy.
- Senpai Chun Hwee
Flexibility, critical thinking and initiative at times are very lacking. At times, we are so bound by rules and responsibilities that when a new problem surfaces in a grey area, you will find the first response by Singaporeans is to argue over who should take up the job of solving the problem.

","   A sculpture with 50 ""wings"" to represent 50 years of Singapore's independence was unveiled at the Botanic Gardens yesterday in celebration of the nation's Golden Jubilee.
Titled Fifty Wings, the 3m-high bronze and stainless steel sculpture was created by American artist James Surls and donated by the retired chairman of global shipping firm BW Group, Dr Helmut Sohmen, and his wife Anna.
The sculpture, inspired by the seed of the Dipterocarp tree found in the Gardens, was unveiled at a reception hosted by the National Parks Board, the United States Embassy and Platform Projects Singapore, a non-profit group supporting contemporary art.
Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong said the Gardens, named as Singapore's first Unesco World Heritage Site last month, stands as an ""icon of the vision"" that founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had of Singapore as a garden city.
Noting that there are more than 20 donated art pieces in the Gardens, Mr Wong said of the latest addition: ""It's fitting that this wonderful gift by the Sohmen family has 50 wings that represent 50 years of independence in Singapore.""
US Ambassador Kirk Wagar noted that next year marks the 50th year of diplomatic relations between Singapore and the US. He said he sees the sculpture as symbolic of the intertwined relationship between the two countries.
""Our two countries, really unlike any other, share a celebration of meritocracy and equality of opportunity, where you can come from anywhere and do anything,"" he said.""
The sculpture is installed opposite the National Orchid Garden, next to the Giant Cola tree.

","   A set of six commemorative $50 and $10 notes with designs depicting significant milestones and achievements in Singapore's history was launched yesterday.
The set, issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to mark Singapore's 50th birthday, comprises one $50 note and five $10 polymer notes, and will be available at banks from tomorrow.
This Golden Jubilee year is ""a time to reflect on our shared history and sacrifices of our pioneers, to reflect on the values that brought us here and to pledge to preserve and uphold these values"", said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the launch of the set of notes at the MAS building in Shenton Way.
The gold $50 note has a transparent panel showing the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first Prime Minister, with a raised fist, leading the crowd with a rallying cry of ""Merdeka!"", which means independence in Malay. The event marked the achievement of self-government by Singapore in 1959, and was a major milestone to independence in 1965.
The back of the note features the first National Day Parade on Aug 9, 1966, and the latest new town of Punggol. The note's gold colour reflects the country's Golden Jubilee, MAS said.
The five $10 notes have a common front design and varying back designs reflecting values and aspirations such as multiracialism, meritocracy, peace and stability, strong families and active citizenry.
Like the current series of notes, all the SG50 bills feature a portrait of Singapore's first President Yusof Ishak on the front. But the new notes have security features that are the first of their kind to be used on a currency note, said MAS.
For example, the $50 note has a security stripe featuring the numbers ""1965"" that switch to ""2015"" when held at a different angle.
The notes were designed by four local artists and designers - Mr Chua Mia Tee, Mr Eng Siak Loy, Mr Weng Ziyan and Mr Fabian Lim.
The public can get the commemorative notes at the branches of nine major retail banks from tomorrow by exchanging them at face value.
These banks include DBS Bank/POSB - which will be extending the opening hours of its branches till 8pm on weekdays for the next two weeks - and OCBC Bank, which has employed additional manpower to manage the crowds expected. Customers of UOB can reserve the notes online and collect them at a later date.
Each individual will be limited to a quota of five sets of notes. Singaporeans will be given priority to exchange the notes from tomorrow to the end of next month. They will have to present their identification card at the bank as proof of citizenship.
The notes will be available to non-Singaporeans from Oct 1.
Dr Andrew Khoo, deputy managing director of corporate development at MAS, said: ""There will be enough SG50 notes available for exchange. There is no need to rush.""
A total of 20 million pieces of $50 notes and 75 million pieces of $10 notes - 15 million pieces of each design - will be printed, he said.
The notes complete the set of currencies issued by MAS to mark SG50, which include a set of three commemorative coins that were launched in April.

","   Meritocracy is a key policy that potential fourth-generation leader Ng Chee Meng wants to champion, but without it being ""taken to the extremes or too narrowly defined"".
The former defence chief, the People's Action Party's (PAP) highest-profile new candidate for the next general election, said without meritocracy here, he and his brothers from ""an average family without networks"" would not have had the opportunities they had.
Two of his brothers are top public servants and former military leaders. Mr Ng, a three-star general, is the highest-ranking military officer the PAP has inducted into politics. But Singapore's current stage of development requires a refining of the workings of meritocracy, said Mr Ng, adding that ""there's no easy solution that we can just put on the table"".
He said: ""But we must come together to do our different parts... so we can provide this support to make a more equal starting platform for our kids.""
He told reporters after his introduction in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC that he wants to champion the issue of social mobility if elected.
NOTHING LEFT TO SAY
I think they should look in the mirror, and I think I've said enough already.
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER TEO CHEE HEAN, when asked about online criticism of a comment he made about a photo showing Workers' Party (WP) chairman Sylvia Lim eating orh luak (oyster omelette) in Fengshan. Mr Teo had asked if the WP was eyeing the ward ""to add it to the pot"" so as to help shore up the financial deficit of its town council in neighbouring Aljunied GRC.
KEEPING PROMISES
I think all will be made known in good time but PAP has always had a strong manifesto and strong agenda for taking Singaporeans forward.
If you look at our track record, we have always fulfilled what we said that we would do. The things that we've done the last five years were the things we said we will do in our manifesto which we put out in 2011, and this is what we will continue to do.
DPM TEO, on the PAP's election manifesto and when it will be released
National debate over how elitism may undermine meritocracy was ignited in recent weeks, after Raffles Institution principal Chan Poh Meng said the school has become a middle-class one that largely caters to the affluent. All eyes were on Mr Ng, 47, yesterday as the PAP introduced more candidates for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, Tampines GRC and Holland-Bukit Timah GRC.
At these sessions, party leaders argued that political stability and the PAP Government's ability to plan for the long term were the most effective bulwark against the excesses of meritocracy.
Education Minister Heng Swee Keat, who anchors Tampines GRC, said ""our education system seeks to bring out the best in every child, regardless of their starting point, regardless of their financial background"". The Government's commitment to broadening the pathways of excellence and ensuring that no child is deprived due to financial disadvantage is ""something we've built up over many, many years"".
""This is in sharp contrast to many education systems around the world where there is no sense of the long term and no strategic direction,"" Mr Heng said.
In Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, where Mr Ng and Temasek Holdings investment director Sun Xueling were introduced, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said young Singaporeans want an environment where they can maximise their potential.
""The way to achieve this really is to have a good, strong, stable team to take Singapore to the future, work together and build a brighter future for all of us,"" he said.
""I think you don't have to look very far around the region and even in developed democracies where continual conflict in the political arena actually brings paralysis, a lack of ability to plan for the long term and multiple U-turns and changes of course. That actually creates many problems for young people who wish to have a society in which they can grow.""
The PAP has introduced all its candidates, except those for four group representation constituencies - Aljunied, East Coast, Marine Parade and Nee Soon - and two single-member constituencies of Fengshan and Punggol East.
These are all constituencies either facing a contest from, or which are held by, the Workers' Party. When asked about this, Mr Teo said: ""All will be made known in good time.""

","   Learn from Britain, and avoid the mistakes it made when it overhauled a merit-based system and ended up with a system criticised for dumbing down examinations.
The recent debate on elitism and meritocracy in our education system struck a chord. As children of the 1970s, my friends and I grew up in a generation when social mobility was highest. We went through an education system which allowed the children of lower-income parents to climb the socio-economic ladder if they did well in school, and make a better life for themselves than their parents and grandparents.
The thought that this meritocratic pillar of Singapore society is under threat, and that there are people calling for it to be dismantled, frightens me to the core. The speech by Mr Chan Poh Meng, the principal of Raffles Institution (RI), a school that traditionally takes in the highest academic performers, warning that RI is becoming more elitist, has focused attention on when meritocracy ends up breeding elitism.
Here, the experience of Britain can be instructive. Singapore's education system, with its O and A levels, is after all based on the British system.
In 1958, British sociologist Michael Young published a satire on society that described a future where a new elite, the ""meritocracy"", rose to rule over an underclass. This new ruling class, unlike the old aristocrats of Britain, legitimised their power not through bloodlines but on merit and on achievement, and, in particular, academic achievement.
Instead of deluding ourselves by dumbing down examinations, excellence must still be pursued while, at the same time, making room for different definitions of success.
At the heart of the satire was the criticism of the then British tripartite education system, which is what the current Singapore education system is based on. The idea was that students, regardless of background, should have access to an education. They would be empowered by placing them in schools with different curricula that suited their needs.
This was done by streaming (a term no doubt familiar to Singaporeans) students into three tiers of state-run schools, through a national exam for all 11-year-olds called the Eleven-Plus examination. At the top were grammar schools for the top Eleven-Plus scorers; followed by secondary technical schools, which trained children in mechanical subjects; and secondary moderns, which trained children for less-skilled jobs and ""home management"". Two separate secondary school examinations were offered to students of different abilities - the General Certificate of Education (GCE) O levels for the more academically inclined, and the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) exams for the less.
Mr Young, in his book, argued that if this were allowed to continue, and with most grammar school students coming from more well-to-do, middle-class families, not only would inequality be renewed (which the tripartite system tried to solve by breaking the class-by-birth social system), it would increase and lead to revolution.
Singapore in 2015 seems to find itself in a similar juncture as Britain in 1958, as far as discussion on education goes. It was noticed in 1958 in Britain that the students at grammar schools were increasingly middle class; it was feared that society would be divided into well-educated, well-off elites lording over a working class trapped generation after generation in the secondary modern schools. The British press called them the ""eggheads and the serfs""; Singapore, on the other hand, has its ""scholars and farmers"".
LESSONS FROM WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
If Singapore is truly at this ""what next"" juncture, what the British government did in the following decades would be instructive not for what it did right, but what it did wrong - it threw the baby out with the bathwater.
In 1958, the Labour government dismantled the tripartite system, and announced that there would be ""grammar school education for all"".
Streaming and the Eleven-Plus examination were abandoned. Over time, as streaming had been abolished, the GCE O levels were found to be too hard for a large proportion of students, and the CSEs too easy, and so the O levels were scrapped and merged with the CSEs to form a new qualification called the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), which was pitched in between the two.
Much later on in 1992, and in another analogous situation to present-day Singapore, the desire of the populace for more easily attained degrees, for those who did not meet the requisite academic standards, was met by converting polytechnics into ""new universities"".
The results were disastrous for British education and society.
First, without streaming and the Eleven-Plus, schools were unable to group students of similar learning ability together to teach efficiently. Teachers often had to teach to the lowest common denominator, leaving academically stronger students bored. Financially, it required more resources as more teachers were required to teach students who were unable to learn with their academic peers in the classrooms.
Second, the well-to-do parents, as people with financial resources always do, were forced to find a way to circumvent the system.
""Grammar schools for all"" proved to be hollow political rhetoric when instead of levelling up, all schools levelled down. Well-to-do parents started sending their children to private schools which, before the abolition of streaming, found it hard to compete with free, high-quality education. This ironically solidified the class-stratification in Britain, with the wealthy taking their children out of the state school system completely, leaving a whole segment of society growing up completely insulated from the rest.
Third, until today, the GCSEs are controversial ,with many lobbying for the reinstatement of the O levels, which Singapore retains.
Critics have blamed these diluted qualifications for a decline in overall academic standards in Britain, with employers criticising this dumbed-down examination for failing to teach basic skills.
Fourth, the proliferation of universities increased the number of graduates by decreasing the worth of a degree. Students who should not be at university found themselves with degrees, but no jobs.
S'PORE CONTEXT - WHAT NEXT?
At this juncture, we should pause and take note of the similarities with Singapore's current dilemma.
There have been calls for the abolition of the PSLE, our version of the Eleven-Plus. There have been calls for the abolition of streaming in schools. We are tearing our hair out over the possibility that our best schools have become ""middle class"" schools. Parents continue the paper chase for degrees, and resist the Government's cry to look beyond them.
The truth is that social stratification and elitism are complex socio-economic issues that cannot and must not be blamed on the education system alone. Unlike the British, we must not overreact and dismantle an entire education system that has served us well for 50 years, when the problems have to be solved by a variety of policies that empower the lower-income on the job, housing, health and cost-of-living fronts.
The Ministry of Education itself has also been tweaking the system effectively without destroying its foundations.
School fees continue to be highly subsidised, no matter what school our students go to. Lower-income children will never be denied a place in schools such as RI or Hwa Chong Institution because they cannot afford it. PSLE results will be announced in bands rather than an aggregate score, to discourage chasing of the ""final mark"".
Instead of deluding ourselves by dumbing down examinations, excellence must still be pursued while, at the same time, making room for different definitions of success - schools for sports and the arts have been established in recognition of this.
And the Government has been setting an example to show that skills rather than degrees should be awarded - those in the civil service and, now, teachers will be given equal pay for equal work, whether one is a graduate or not.
These are steps in the right direction. But the truth is that social mobility cannot be preserved at the same rates as before, as Singapore develops.
Parents from previous generations who have done well will have more financial, social and cultural resources to help their children do well. What Singapore must continue to do is make sure access to schools remains open, and that students have the opportunities to learn and interact across the socio-economic strata in school.
The Government will have its work cut out, not least because the problems the country faces, which are developed-country problems, have no easy answers.
But one thing is for sure: meritocracy, despite its roots in British satire, must continue being one of our core organising principles in Singapore. We must not, like our former colonial masters, throw the baby out with the bathwater.The writer is a media entrepreneur and a former Nominated Member of Parliament.

","   Grouping students of similar academic standards together may not be the best way for them to learn (""How not to dismantle a meritocratic system""; last Friday).
I am a Singaporean who grew up overseas. There, students of different ages were in the same class, for example, Primary 1 and 2 students studied together.
Students took on the role of both teacher and learner; older students benefited from teaching the younger ones, as the most effective way to retain information is to teach it, and younger students were inspired to go beyond what was expected of them.
This was not what I experienced when I moved back to Singapore in Secondary 1 to study in a local school's ""gifted"" class.
Studying with peers of similar academic strengths did not foster that same open environment of teaching and learning.
I later went on to study for the International Baccalaureate at St Joseph's Institution International, and found that I benefited greatly from working with students of different academic interests - everyone, regardless of their academic strength, has something to bring to the table.
It is unrealistic to group people together based on academic ability - out in the real world, we have to interact and work with people of different academic, social and economic backgrounds.
Barring more demanding subjects like mathematics or foreign languages, streaming might not actually be beneficial to students.
Furthermore, it saddens me to think that ""social mobility cannot be preserved at the same rates as before, as Singapore develops"", as mentioned in the article above.
It is true that with the rise of the middle class and the efforts of parents to give their children a better education, those from more affluent backgrounds have the upper hand.
But Singapore should not resign itself to lower social mobility.
Those who have benefited from the system of meritocracy should give back to society, whether through donating to schools to enhance their facilities and increase their scholarships, or volunteering in the community
and offering to help the less privileged students.
That way, all can work together to build an all-encompassing Singapore.

","   The major goals of the Government, as illustrated by Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Tharman Shanmugaratnam in his speech at the Economic Society of Singapore SG50 Distinguished Lecture, are to sustain income growth, mitigate income inequality and enhance social mobility.
The Government has systematically devised a series of plans to achieve these, particularly since 2006, he said.
After a decade of policy implementation, Singapore has managed to sustain income growth across the board, including the low-income households. The bottom 20 per cent of employed citizen households saw their incomes per household member from work rise 37 per cent from 2004 to 2014 (after taxes and transfers).
With the use of government transfers from tax revenues, income inequality has been mitigated. The long-term solution for the uplifting of low-income households is to maintain social mobility through education and skills training.
On top of attaining the three goals, the overall objective is to develop Singapore into an innovative and inclusive society.
In his National Day Rally speech on Aug 23, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced more schemes to help low-income and middle-income households. These include higher housing grants, more generous Baby Bonus payments and an extra week of paternity leave. The income ceilings for couples to purchase Housing Board flats and executive condominiums were also raised.
All these mean more expenses to be financed by government transfers through tax revenues.
Using tax revenues from the rich to help the poor is a common practice across the developed world, notably in European and Scandinavian countries.
The state imposes highly progressive tax rates to pay for health expenses, education costs, unemployment benefits and other social benefits. The marginal tax rates are steep, and attract criticism that they discourage people from working harder in these welfare states.
Welfare benefits, once given, are not easily withdrawn without dampening popular support. High tax rates are necessary to keep on providing welfare benefits, and the two are closely intertwined.
The welfarism trap weakens work incentive and hobbles the development of entrepreneurship. In his speech at the British Chamber of Commerce in Singapore in 2004, Mr Lee Kuan Yew said: ""Cradle-to-grave welfarism blunted the ambition of many budding entrepreneurs. Worse, high personal taxes dampened the desire of many to achieve wealth and success.""
He also pointed out in 1982 ""the folly of populist politicians who win elections playing the politics of equal rewards or egalitarianism: squeeze the successful to pay for the welfare of the poor, and end up with the equalisation of poverty"".
Although his comments were made in a different context, they may still be relevant in the discussion of policy formulation in Singapore.
EROSION ON WORK ETHICS
There is no free lunch and everyone should work and earn his or her own living. The Government has rejected the idea of welfarism since our independence.
After a few decades of development, the economy has grown substantially but the distribution of the fruits of growth has not been even, which is to be expected in a competitive meritocracy where greater rewards go to those who succeed.
Income disparity hence becomes greater, and the divide between the successful and the poor becomes more evident. The Government has mitigated the inequality by providing affordable housing and public transport, better healthcare and the Workfare supplement to help low-wage workers.
The Government also encourages the successful to help those who have lagged behind. After the General Election in 2011, it has obviously changed its approach, and dished out more goodies to help the low- and middle-income groups. HDB grants, healthcare benefits, baby bonuses and other subsidies have increased. This gives an impression that the Government has been moving towards welfarism in recent years.
DPM Tharman acknowledges that government transfers have been deployed to subsidise low-income households for nearly a decade, and explains that it helps to narrow the inequality gap and yields a lower Gini coefficient after taxes and transfers.
While Mr Tharman is mindful to keep the overall tax burden low, particularly for the middle-income group, the increasing freebies given now and in the future will drive up tax rates to be more progressive. The change in property taxes from a flat rate to progressive ones in the past few years is one example.
Is this approach of taxing more, either in rates or in form, and giving more to citizens, a move towards creating a welfare state?
The Government's answer, I believe, is definitely no. Some critics, however, call Singapore a welfare state that works.
DEBT BURDEN FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
In the traditional welfare state, the state adopts populist policies in providing goodies to such an extent that the present generation might go bankrupt, leaving debt burdens to future generations.
This is certainly not the case for Singapore, whose Budgets remain healthy with surpluses in most years, going into occasional minor deficits in past decades. No debt burdens are likely to be carried forward to future generations. The Government also does not need to draw on past reserves or Budget surpluses from earlier generations to pay for current expenditure.
The fear of falling into the traditional welfarism trap is unfounded, which is true at least in the present and next few years.
But how long can this happy state of affairs remain?
With the income inequality gap widening in the past decade, the amounts of government transfers needed to reduce inequalities have been on the rise year after year.
People's desire for a change of lifestyle and an increase in living standards will force the Government to increase the types and amounts of transfers over the years. For instance, every resident household member received an average of $3,370 in transfers from the Government in 2014, compared with $2,700 in 2009, an increase of 25 per cent.
This is particularly true in a democratic regime where the electorate can use votes to make demands.
The Government will have to either increase marginal tax rates, making income taxes and property taxes more progressive, and/or levy new taxes to finance the ever increasing transfers and freebies.
The rich will probably have no qualms about paying more taxes here, which are still relatively low compared with high taxes in other countries, but the middle-income earners, especially fixed-income employees, will suffer.
As in Hong Kong, the present low personal and corporate income taxes regime is Singapore's advantage over countries with high taxes such as Britain, Australia and the Scandinavian countries. If the taxes are raised to be more progressive, the advantage may gradually vanish. The goods and services tax (GST), Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums and import duties for motor vehicles , stamp duties for property transactions and all kind of levies have increased costs and made Singapore a costly and expensive city for all residents, local as well as foreign. These will further reduce Singapore's comparative advantage, which may impact income growth adversely.
We have come a long way to reach where we are today. The sustained economic growth over the years has transformed Singapore into a First World nation.
With the development of a knowledge-based economy, those who possess advanced knowledge, new skills and high technologies are greatly rewarded and earn more. Income disparity has become stark as a result. There is no question that the successful should help the less privileged through taxes and government transfers.
But the Government should be mindful to avoid falling into the welfarism trap as voters' demands may be insatiable and transfers can over the years snowball into unbearable burdens.
The Government should, therefore, dampen the request for more transfers and keep Singapore far away from becoming a welfare state similar to those in the West.

","   As campaigning kicks into high gear, The Straits Times spotlights some candidates to find out how they interact with residents and what drives them. Today, we talk to former Chief of Defence Force Ng Chee Meng from the PAP and Prof Paul Tambyah of the SDP
It was tough deciding whether to make the switch from three-star general to newbie politician, but once former Chief of Defence Force Ng Chee Meng made up his mind, he was ready to go.
By the time he retired from the Singapore Armed Forces on Aug 18, he had already got 12 long- and short-sleeved shirts tailored specially for his new role.
It was close to midnight when his farewell dinner ended that day and, instead of going home, he headed for Punggol North to meet grassroots leaders and was introduced to the People's Action Party (PAP) activists and volunteers he would be working with from the very next day.
SAF 'A REFLECTION OF SOCIETY'
The military is a regimented organisation but it is not as if I've lived away from society. In the UK, you join at age 18, you retire at 60 in the same regiment, you are isolated from the community. The way we set up the SAF is quite different. We are a reflection of society. We get all the 18-year-old males coming in, so you know this is a slice of society, this is representative and you learn to talk to different groups of people.
MR NG CHEE MENG, on adjusting to working outside the military
""In my imagination, I thought I'd have a break when I retired. I had less than one minute,"" he said with a laugh during an interview with The Straits Times.
Watching him on the ground in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, it is hard to imagine that he quit the military life barely three weeks ago.
The former fighter pilot does not have the air of having been military top-brass. On the campaign trail, his bearing is erect but not imposing. He is quick to wave and smile at passers-by.
""How are you? I'm the new face, Ng Chee Meng, who is here to serve you,"" he says, as he extends his hand to residents during house visits.
The highest-ranking military man to enter Singapore politics, he is a PAP new face touted as a potential front-bencher and part of Singapore's fourth-generation leadership.
The spotlight is on him in this general election because former generals Tan Chuan-Jin and Chan Chun Sing, who were elected in the 2011 General Election, became ministers swiftly.
Mr Ng, 47, is a self-avowed man of principle and committed Christian, and says he is still against having casinos in Singapore.
""Can I see the plus sides of the economic value-add, the job creation? Yes. But on the other extreme are the moral positions, and the societal problems that are associated (with casinos). I'm quite principled,"" he said.
His stand on casinos emerges from his belief that one should do what is right, not what is expedient, while making ""pragmatic adjustments"" to ensure Singapore continues to progress.
Ultimately, Singaporeans ""must see, must feel the success"" so they can be united to form the core of the country, said Mr Ng, who also shared this vision on Thursday night in his maiden speech at a PAP rally in Buangkok. He is in the six-member Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC team.
The speech to the rally crowd was unlike those he made in his 29 years in the Singapore Armed Forces - talking policy rather than addressing troops.
On stage in his new role, with the spotlight trained on him, he might have seemed tentative.
But it was a different picture during his interview. He was forthright and direct: ""When it came to this call for me to serve in this capacity, it was unthinkable for me personally to step away.""
In fact, the invitation to enter politics seems to have come as a surprise. He said he had envisaged a post-military life in the administrative service or private sector, or setting up a social enterprise.
Entering politics was a tough decision, he admitted. Tears welled up in his eyes as he recalled how he and his wife, Michelle, with whom he has two daughters, agonised over it.
They were aware it would be ""all-consuming"" and that the ""loss of privacy is complete"".
But in the end, both were ""convinced that this is a calling, and we are not looking back"".
But don't ask him about talk that he might be an office-holder or more after the general election. He laughed and said: ""One step at a time.""
And don't ask if he has a dream portfolio, either. He has ""no clear-cut preferences"", and his major ambition was to be a fighter pilot.
For now, he is focused on getting elected.
THE 'PLAYFUL' BROTHER
Mr Ng is known as one of the high-flying Ng brothers. Two of his four brothers, like him, served in the SAF.
Older brother Chee Khern, 50, was air force chief and is now Permanent Secretary (Defence Development), while younger brother Chee Peng, 45, stepped down as navy chief last year and is now chief executive of the CPF Board. Both of them are President's Scholars.
Growing up, Mr Ng was the ""most playful"" of the lot, he confessed.
His businessman father and housewife mother, who have both died, were ""quite laissez faire"" about education, said Mr Ng.
""So there wasn't like a tiger mum. You study, you take responsibility, and we were reasonably balanced between play and study.""
If he is elected on Sept 11, he wants to look into new policies or refine existing ones to help the sandwiched class, specifically younger families.
Noting that the Government is already addressing the needs of the Pioneer Generation and lower- income groups by reducing the costs of living, he said he wants to ensure Singaporeans ""succeed together, take care of each other, leave no man behind"".
And what does succeeding in life mean? Mr Ng, who graduated from the prestigious US Air Force Academy and holds a Master of Arts from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said: ""There are different levels of success - making sure that people without qualifications, but the skills, can actually get ahead.""
Citing how the SAF has upgraded and enabled ITE graduates to take senior positions in the military, he said such a system could be translated to the national level.
At Singapore's current stage of development, people should also change how they view meritocracy, which he feels has become more closely linked to ""one's ability to make a good living than actually leading a complete life"".

"," Populism
","   Two solo candidates from the People's Action Party (PAP) came out swinging last night, slamming the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) for proposing policies they said were populist and not in Singapore's interests.
The SDP's proposals for free healthcare, services and education will lead Singapore to spend more than it can afford, said Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Grace Fu, who is defending her seat in Yuhua against the SDP's Jaslyn Go.
The SDP's values and policies ""point to three words: spend, spend and spend"", said Ms Fu at a rally in Jurong East Stadium.
There is a flip side to having free healthcare, food and fuel subsidies, minimum wage and unemployment benefits, said the two-term MP. ""What they're not telling you, voters, are these: Other countries (with these policies) have high taxes. Not Singapore. Other countries have oil, gold and timber. Not Singapore.""
She added: ""Other countries have low growth, even no growth. Not Singapore. Other countries have governments that borrow heavily and have depreciating currencies. Not Singapore.""
She also cited high youth unemployment of up to 50 per cent in other countries, strikes that last for weeks and gridlocked parliaments unable to pass laws and function.
On why the SDP was not highlighting these nasty consequences, Ms Fu said: ""They are interested in politics only. They want to get into Parliament and they will sacrifice the long-term interests of Singapore, if necessary, to get elected.""
""The SDP is using emotions, populist policies and leading Singapore down the slippery road that many other countries are trying to come back up from but cannot,"" she said, adding that it was a path of no return.
But with the PAP at its helm, Singapore has achieved much in the last 50 years, including clean water, high rates of home ownership, rising salaries and a world-class port.
""Our policies work. They may not be the most popular, but they are the best policies for us.
""They're built on core values like meritocracy, multiracialism, self-reliance and honesty that have served Singapore well,"" said Ms Fu.
Her colleague David Ong, a candidate for single-seat Bukit Batok, picked up on the theme in his rally speech in his first solo battle.
How Bukit Batok is run and how Singapore is effectively managed boils down to good governance, as demonstrated by the PAP, he said.
The PAP does what is right instead of what is popular, said Mr Ong, whose opponents are the SDP's Sadasivam Veriyah and Mr Samir Salim Neji, an independent.
""Populist government becomes a game of always promising low taxes and big government entitlements, with the resulting deficits kicked down the road for the next generation to bear,"" said Mr Ong.
""Good governance is very much about being an effective government. A government that gets things done for its people and serves the interests of its people, and not the party,"" he added.
Mr Ong gave a progress report of his efforts over the past four years in Bukit Batok, the ward of Jurong GRC he helmed as a first-term MP.
Covered linkways have been built and flats upgraded, with a hawker centre, an eldercare centre and two early childhood education centres on the way, he said to cheers.
More than 9,000 students have benefited from education bursaries and free tuition programmes, and more than 1,000 needy senior residents receive financial and social assistance each year, he added.
Ms Fu said: ""What you want is an effective MP but, more importantly, an MP who... can run an effective town council, who cares about you and your family, your well-being and future, and who will not just use you to get into Parliament.""

","   When a primary school dropout makes it to polytechnic and a 50-year-old woman enrols at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), it shows that Singapore's education system provides opportunities to bring out the best in everyone, said Education Minister Heng Swee Keat.
""That is why I'm so committed to making every school a good school, because every child is a child of Singapore, every adult is a member of our society,"" he said yesterday at the People's Action Party (PAP) lunchtime rally at the promenade outside UOB Plaza.
Whether it is the ITE, polytechnic, university or the SkillsFuture scheme to promote continual education and training, the focus is on broadening pathways to success, he said.
But ultimately, a good education alone is not enough, said Mr Heng, who leads the PAP's five-member team in Tampines GRC.
""What do our students do when they finish school? Do they have jobs to go to? Do they have continuing opportunities to train, to learn? It all depends on one thing.
STRONG MANDATE WANTED
This GE is about selecting a team that can best serve you. We are taking every contest in every constituency seriously. If we do not vote wisely, we may wake up in the morning and find that another party, or even a coalition, is in power, and the PAP is out. If you want the PAP to form the government, give us a strong mandate so we can continue to shine as a little red dot.
EDUCATION MINISTER HENG SWEE KEAT at the end of the PAP's Tampines GRC rally
It depends on whether Singapore succeeds. If Singapore fails, the best education we give to our children will just mean one thing, that they have to go to other countries to find opportunities. Do we want that?""
PAP newcomer Amrin Amin offered himself as an example of what goes right in an education system that offers opportunities to all. A candidate in Sembawang GRC, he told the crowd at the rally: ""My parents took on multiple jobs to support us. I went to ordinary schools in Singapore - I am now a lawyer.""
He said it was unlikely that a minority-race individual from a background like his would have as many good opportunities in another country.
He also did not think a two- or three-party system would fulfil the aspirations of minority communities.
The PAP candidate in single- seat Fengshan, Ms Cheryl Chan, said that with a strong team of leaders in place, Singaporeans will be assured that meritocracy will prevail for another 50 years.
Another new face, Mr Darryl David, a father of two who is a candidate in Ang Mo Kio GRC, said his concern is providing quality after- care for families with young children.

","   This general election in Singapore's 50th year of independence confirms the return of politics to this city state after a prolonged absence. By that, I mean the return of contestation between parties for influence over national policy, which is a mark of electoral politics elsewhere but which in the Republic has been held at bay for decades by two factors.
First, the quality of the PAP's technocratic leadership, which has delivered in an exceptional way most of the goods that citizens everywhere want: safety, security, stability and a good standard of living as measured by good jobs, good schools and good housing.
Second, the structures that the PAP Government has put in place to discourage political competition.
What emerged was an ""administrative state"", to quote political scientist Chan Heng Chee, who used the term in an essay published in 1975 - a state which saw ""the steady and systematic depoliticisation of a politically active and aggressive citizenry"".
Indeed, from 1968 to 1981, the PAP held all the seats in Parliament. Thereafter, it never lost more than four seats in the House - until 2011. That marked a turning point.
It was the year of a watershed election that energised voters and sparked widespread ground-level interest in politics. Even then, the PAP lost only six out of 87 seats, but the process of repoliticisation had begun. The current campaign confirms that politics is indeed back and looks set to stay.
This round, every seat is contested - a first since independence. Nine political parties have entered the fray.
The PAP, which is contesting all 89 seats, has, as usual, fielded a team heavy with technocrat ministers, MPs and new candidates. The difference this time is that all are being put through a baptism of fire.
They are up against a diverse range of characters - from seasoned opposition politicians to newcomers with sparkling credentials to fringe players who would be lucky to keep their election deposits.
Now, the thing about fielding technocrats in an election is that they are out of their comfort zone and unable to play to their strengths. What they are good at are rational discourse, weighing costs and benefits, making policy, running organisations. They are used to a controlled environment.
But electoral politics is none of that. It is a messy, unpredictable affair. It is about selling, persuading, tapping rhetoric to stir emotions, attacking opponents and connecting with voters to get them on your side.
Some political parties are better at it than others. The Workers' Party, for example, stages rallies that attract tens of thousands of people. Yesterday, on the final day of campaigning, it released a four-minute video - an emotive montage depicting these rallies as platforms for its candidates to speak up for and empower voters. Its campaign slogan, after all, is Empower Your Future.
Its mailer to households in constituencies it is contesting kicks off with a message from WP chief Low Thia Khiang. He tells voters: ""Your vote is a signal to the ruling party that it cannot do what it deems fit without taking you seriously.""
As for the PAP, its challenge in this campaign is to stay true to its strengths of rational, long-term policymaking while relearning the art of politics to secure seats in Parliament.
It has tapped the personal popularity of its chief, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, to appeal directly to voters. Mr Lee has campaigned in both PAP and opposition-held constituencies, addressed three night rallies and one lunchtime rally downtown and sent out two direct mailers.
The second, which went out yesterday, is entitled ""The future of Singapore is in your hands"" and reflects Mr Lee's style of speaking - earnest and direct. It quotes a young Singaporean who wrote to Mr Lee to express his concern that this election would see the loss of ""more good ministers"".
Mr Lee tells voters that ""the PAP has a clear vision and concrete plans for Singapore"". He cites the Pioneer Generation Package, measures to lighten the load of the ""sandwiched generation"" and help for low-income and disadvantaged families.
""The opposition party,"" he adds, ""says vote for us, we will bargain for more for you. Whatever the Government does, we will ask for more.
""That is not a responsible approach. The PAP works together with Singaporeans for a better future. We hold public consultations, we debate hard choices openly, we support the growth of civic voices in business and social causes, and on environmental issues. Together we can solve hard problems.""
Last night, the PAP tapped another of its brand-name leaders to cap its hard-fought campaign in East Coast GRC with a powerful speech on change.
Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam acknowledged that the PAP used to be a top-down government and often quite heavy-handed. ""It is no longer that way, because we have changed... Strong leadership is listening, engaging, moving with people but also moving people with you to a better future,"" he said.
He also cited the ways in which the Government is rebalancing economic and social policies to ensure a fair and inclusive society, and intervening to keep Singapore a true meritocracy, where ""birth is not destiny"".
The message to voters: The PAP is a party with both substance and heart and it is prepared to change with the times.
Politics, after all, is the art of the possible. In this election, several parties have come forward to offer voters their vision of what is possible. May Singapore be the better for the return of such contestation.

East Coast GRC is shaping up to be one of the hottest battlegrounds for the Sept 11 polls. The PAP's opponents, the Workers' Party, polled 45.17 per cent of valid votes there in the 2011 election - up from 36.14 per cent in 2006.
At last night's rally, Mr Tharman said strong leadership today is different from strong leadership 20 or 30 years ago.
""(Strong leadership today) means listening, actively engaging, changing when the situation changes, and continually adapting,"" he said, adding that his frequent interactions with residents have been ""a tremendous learning experience"".
""We used to be a top-down government, quite heavy-handed. You know what I mean.
""It is no longer that way, because Singapore has changed, and we have changed... A changed PAP is going to lead you into the future.""
Mr Tharman, who is also Finance Minister and a candidate for Jurong GRC, noted that the Government has been complementing economic policies with more active social policies in recent years, marking another significant shift.
""A successful economy by itself will not give us an inclusive and fair society,"" he added.
For every $1 of tax - mainly goods and services tax - that those in the bottom 10 per cent income group pay, they receive $6 back in subsidies - almost double the amount 10 years ago.
Mr Tharman cited policies such as the Workfare Income Supplement for lower-wage workers, and the progressive wage model for the cleaning and security sectors.
Unlike a minimum wage strategy, ""our approaches are succeeding without losing jobs for older low-skilled workers who are the most vulnerable"", he added.
The Government is also adding to the savings of lower-income Singaporeans through their Central Provident Fund accounts - a sustainable system which does not impose a burden on the next generation, unlike other pension systems in the United States, Europe and Britain.
Another major shift has been towards giving Singaporeans opportunities to maximise their potential at all stages of life and promoting greater social mobility, instead of relying on a system where success depends on grades earned early on.
""We are making sure that in Singapore birth is never destiny... Meritocracy alone will not produce social mobility.
""We have to create opportunities for Singaporeans to maximise their potential throughout life.""
This means intervening early in life to help children who start off with less, as well as investing in middle-aged workers ""so no one peaks in their early 40s"".
Countries like the US are now grappling with a ""polarised"" workforce where those at the top are moving up but ""the middle is gradually disappearing, because technology and automation are taking over"".
""We will do everything we can to avoid this,"" said Mr Tharman.
This means supporting employers who invest in Singaporeans, particularly middle-aged professionals, managers and executives.
""(We want to) make sure that middle-income Singaporeans have good careers throughout their lives, that they don't become dispensable.""

254,"First casinos, then one million foreign workers, riots, workers' strike and frequent breakdowns of trains.

","   Good evening, fellow Singaporeans.
An election is about the future, not the past. But the PAP talks day in day out about the past 50 years as one past.
Actually, we have two pasts, the first 40 years and the last 10 years under the current PM.
The first 40 years were relatively good years.
But beginning from 2004 when Lee Hsien Loong took over, Singapore has been going down the drain.
First casinos, then one million foreign workers, riots, workers' strike and frequent breakdowns of trains. Do you still want this Government to mess up your lives for five more years?
PM claimed that PAP has delivered on all its promises. He has conveniently forgotten the 5 ""Cs"", career, car, condominium, cash and country club which they have not delivered.
They invested your CPF money, achieved average return of 6 per cent a year, but give you only 2.5 per cent and keep the excess return of 3.5 per cent.
This amounts to as much as $8.75 billion in 2014 alone.
This is your money that they have short-changed you. That's why more than half of Singaporeans do not have adequate savings for retirement.
PM said this election is about choosing the next leadership team.
The fact that he has asked Goh Chok Tong to stay shows that leadership succession has failed. Will the new candidates be any better? Are they just yes-men from the civil service and the military?
Have earlier batches shown that they could run key agencies in public transport and shipping? Or will they bring Singapore further down the road of decline?
PAP leaders talk unashamedly about honouring the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. They are just opportunistic. They make use of his name for their own political ends.
In fact, they have betrayed his ideals on foreign workers, trust and meritocracy.
Today, Singapore has five times more foreign workers than what he implied Singapore could tolerate.
Secondly, trust in PAP is so low that in an international survey, only 26 per cent of Singaporeans trust their government leaders to tell the truth.
Thirdly, an international magazine has ranked Singapore as the top 5 country in the world where ""politically connected businessmen are most likely to prosper"". This is the opposite of meritocracy which allows people to succeed on the basis of capability, not connections.
So LKY's ideals have been betrayed under his son's watch as PM. If Singaporeans vote out of gratitude to the father, they will end in servitude to the son.
Fellow Singaporeans, do you want five more years of the unhappiness and misery of the past 10 years under PAP?
Or do you want to take back our country, our jobs, our space, our pride?
We ask you to vote Singaporeans First to restore our nation.
Vote for change. Vote SingFirst.

","   A nondescript formica-topped table from the basement dining room of 38 Oxley Road, where the nation's founding leaders once gathered to discuss how to secure independence from British rule, can now be seen in an exhibition at the National Museum of Singapore.
The executors and trustees of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew's estate, his children, Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang, donated the table to the museum's newest showcase called We Built A Nation.
The exhibition chronicles the contributions of the pioneer team of leaders such as Dr Toh Chin Chye, Dr Goh Keng Swee and Mr S. Rajaratnam, who formed the People's Action Party alongside Mr Lee.
It includes 115 artefacts, about half of which come from the Lee estate. Some highlights are Mr Lee's writing table; a red box he used to keep his working documents until Feb 4, a day before he was hospitalised; his desktop computer; and language books he had studied, such as a 1951 publication called Malay Sayings and a 1955 copy of Lessons In The Amoy Vernacular.
It is the largest and most thorough showcase of his personal effects since he died on March 23.
MR LEE KUAN YEW'S PERSONAL DESK
I can still picture him in my mind's eye, regularly working into the wee hours of the night at this desk - reading, writing, thinking.
MR LEE HSIEN YANG, on the writing table that is on display
It is also the first such exhibition to home in on the contributions of Singapore's founding fathers.
The families of the early leaders, who also include Mr E.W. Barker, Mr Hon Sui Sen, Mr Yusof Ishak, Mr Devan Nair and Mr Othman Wok, loaned artefacts for the exhibition.
Among these is a set of recently declassified documents from Dr Goh's ""Albatross File"", which comprise, among other things, handwritten notes of meetings with Malaysian leaders relating to the separation from Malaysia. Dr Goh explained in a 1980 interview that the Albatross ""was Malaysia. By that time, the great expectations that we foolishly had - that Malaysia would bring prosperity, common market, peace, harmony, all that - we were quickly disillusioned. And it became an Albatross round our necks"".
The exhibition details the nation's first decade of independence from 1965 to 1975 and is divided into eight sections, beginning with the birth of a nation.
It will be open daily from 10am to 7pm starting today, for a year. Admission is free for Singaporeans and permanent residents.
Culture, Community and Youth Minister Lawrence Wong, speaking at the opening, said the idea arose after an exhibition in memory of Mr Lee in March drew large crowds.
Mr Wong said the two guiding principles behind it was that it should honour not just one man but also the founding generation of leaders, and it should focus on the ideals and values they stood for. These include integrity, country above self, multiracialism and meritocracy.
""I hope visitors will also take time to reflect on the stories behind the artefacts, and how they speak of the values and ideals that underpin the foundations of our nation,"" he added.
Other highlights at the showcase include a Seiko gold watch gifted to Mr Rajaratnam; Mr Hon's calculator - one of the first produced in a Hewlett Packard factory here; and a Colt Cobra revolver belonging to the late national development minister Lim Kim San. The gun was issued to ministers to protect themselves in Singapore's tumultuous early years.
Speaking at the exhibition, Mr Lee Hsien Yang said the writing table had once been used by himself, his sister and elder brother, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, for tuition lessons. It later became the late Mr Lee's personal desk.
Other artefacts from the Lee estate include a model sailing ship presented to Mr Lee by a Hokkien shopkeeper following a ""gruelling schedule"" of constituency visits from December 1962 to September 1963. Mr Lee treasured it because it represented the moment he could feel the people warming to him as their leader.
Also on show is a scale model of the 100-year-old pre-war Oxley Road bungalow, which might be the only way for the public to have a close look at the historic space. Mr Lee said in his will that he wanted his home demolished immediately after his death or when his daughter moves out of it.

256,"[...]all that the demand produced was educational mediocrity as the social norm.
",257,NA," Sep 23, 2015
"," Opinion
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Ratings & rankings; Colleges & universities; Education
","   The rise of the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to the top 13, in an annual ranking of the world's best universities, is certainly a source of pride to Singaporeans generally. A change in how research citation is evaluated partly resulted in a substantial improvement in the universities' performance on the index of excellence drawn up by London-based education consultancy Quacquarelli Symonds. However, NUS and NTU would have bettered their rankings even without the change, according to an official of the consultancy. This endorsement lends credence to the belief that they are on track to greater success.
The latest rankings vindicate the almost devotional pursuit of quality at both universities. They avoided going the way of many institutions, not only in the Third World but also in the West, which churned out an increasing number of graduates to accommodate the public clamour for greater access to tertiary education. Countries, universities and ultimately the most important of all stakeholders, students themselves, suffered when tertiary education was viewed as an entitlement to be achieved through political pressure if necessary. In the end, all that the demand produced was educational mediocrity as the social norm. An expansive meritocracy - locating a wide range of talent to be tutored and mentored - that should lie at the heart of educational selection was lost in acceding to the triumph of quantity over quality.
Singapore managed to find a different route, where it attuned its universities to meeting market demands. As a result, Singapore graduates are employable and readily employed. In this context, it is a happy dampener of sorts that the lot of local graduates will not rise appreciably as a result of ratings such as the latest one. Employers regard Singapore's universities so well already that their latest global positions are unlikely to come as much of a surprise.
However, the rankings could effect a change in the perception of local universities among young Singaporeans. There is much to be said for a foreign education - it opens up young minds to the competing cultures of the world, each believing that it possesses a special pathway to the truth. What such an education gives students is a way of navigating between alternative visions of reality. However, there is no reason why local education cannot do this as well. At much lower cost, it could bring the world home to Singapore. Indeed, foreign faculty and students, whether from the rest of Asia or farther abroad, are contributing to that effort already. Such a holistic education with its feet firmly planted in Singaporean values and concerns and the needs of the economy is far more important to attain than just rat-cheting up one's position in global rankings.

"," The Straits Times; Singapore
",NA,"   I am concerned that we do not have more women and more promotions of women in the new Cabinet (""PM names Cabinet aimed at leadership succession"" and ""Grace Fu finds place in history with two firsts""; both published on Tuesday).
In this time and age, it cannot be said that there are no available female talents or that these talents cannot be groomed to take on more responsible positions.
We have seen women proving their worth in formal education and in the workplace. Many of them are leading major organisations and delivering commendable results.
With the disproportionate number of men in the Cabinet, perhaps there are underlying issues that we have not addressed in our search for female talents.
We need to find out why we do not have more women in the Cabinet and take action to make it happen.
Women in the Cabinet can complement the men to take Singapore to a higher level in the next stage of our growth.
We need to intensify our search for good female talents and work at grooming them, so that there will be adequate representation of women in the Cabinet.
I am not suggesting having a quota for women in the Cabinet.
Meritocracy should still apply.
However, we should not be satisfied with having just one woman as a full minister.
Gender issues should not be allowed to affect our overall effectiveness and efficiency.
On the other hand, not addressing the gender issue can cause a cascade of negative consequences, including having policy myopia and less-than-representational feedback from the electorate.
I hope that in future changes, we will see more women in the Cabinet. They can complement the men in the Cabinet to take Singapore to a higher level in the next stage of our growth.
All of us should help women all over the world expand their potential and pursue their passions in life. Let us help them enjoy equal rights and opportunities and maximise their contributions to their loved ones, community, workplace and society.
Women are often born to play on an unlevel playing field. They face many disadvantages throughout their lives, including negative discrimination about women's place in society.
Women have to generally work harder to prove their worth. They have to make more sacrifices in finding their place under the family and organisational sun.
We can certainly do more and do better to help them enjoy their rightful place in politics and in other aspects of life.

","   Lifting female workforce participation is no longer just a women's issue but a Singapore issue relating to economic competitiveness, the top woman politician here has said.
Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu yesterday called on the corporate sector to keep cultivating a pro-family work environment and lift gender representation in leadership positions.
""Women will be the next engine of growth as they play an ever important role at home and in the workplace,"" added Ms Fu, the first woman to helm a ministry as a full minister in Singapore.
Given the demographic challenge of a rapidly ageing and shrinking population, she said there is a need to raise labour force participation rates, especially of women and seniors, to boost the local workforce.
For every citizen who is retiring, 1.4 citizens are entering the workforce, Ms Fu said. By 2030, at current birth rates, only 0.7 citizen will enter the workforce for every citizen retiring.
She noted that if the female labour force participation rate grew from 59 per cent now to 76 per cent - the rate for males - this would lift Singapore's local labour force by 13 per cent.
Speaking at an EY conference on gender parity yesterday, Ms Fu added that having a ""meaningful representation"" of women in the leadership also sends a strong signal that the company values women's contribution and views.
And women have steadily been chipping away at the glass ceiling. Citing figures from the Diversity Action Committee, EY advisory managing partner Mildred Tan said women's representation on boards of companies listed on the Singapore Exchange crept up to 9.1 per cent this year, up from 8.8 per cent last year and 8.3 per cent a year before that.
Ms Tan noted that one way to spur women's advancement in the workplace is to make female role models visible.
The point was later picked up by Ms Yong Ying-I, Permanent Secretary at the Public Service Division of the Prime Minister's Office, during a panel discussion, in describing how the civil service can change cultural perception about certain jobs.
This can be done via corporate communications and branding efforts, said Ms Yong. For example, generating publicity when the Singapore Armed Forces promoted the first female to the rank of brigadier-general this year.
Still, Ms Yong said the gender parity is not an ""overt goal"" of the Singapore public service, and it continues to take the position of meritocracy and equal opportunity .
The public service is the largest employer in Singapore, with 141,000 staff. Ms Yong shared that 53 per cent of its employees are women, while those at leadership level account for 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the total headcount.
Another way to encourage greater participation by women would be to put in place progressive corporate policies.
For example, Deutsche Bank in Singapore offers extended paternity leave to male staff - two weeks instead of one - and allows female staff to have an additional six months of flexible work arrangement to ease them back to work after they return from maternity leave.
The bank has 2,000 employees in Singapore, 40 per cent of whom are women.

","   From violent race riots to being lauded for ethnic tolerance, that's how far it has come. But there is no room for complacency
The date is July 21, 1964 - barely a year since Singapore became part of the Federation of Malaysia.
A procession is held to mark Prophet Muhammad's birthday, starting at the Padang and ending in Geylang.
But the festive occasion will soon turn sour. A scuffle breaks out between Malays in the procession and Chinese bystanders, escalating into nationwide violence.
By the time a 13-day curfew was lifted, 23 people died and 454 people were injured. Singapore would later learn it was an orchestrated attempt to stir up racial tensions.
Two months later, another riot breaks out after rumours spread that a Malay trishaw rider was killed by a group of Chinese men, with 13 dead and 106 injured.
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER
We have sound principles in place but practice and realisation is the real challenge in some domains more than others.
SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGIST LAI AH ENG of the National University of Singapore.
Fast forward to today and modern, independent Singapore is celebrating 50 years of prosperity and relative peace. Now, July 21 is notable as Racial Harmony Day, when young generations of Singaporeans go to school decked in racial garb and are taught the virtues of respecting diversity.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last month that no matter the progress over the last 50 years, it would be ""complacent and dangerous"" to be lulled into a false sense of safety that race and religion matters are no more the divisive issues they once were.
The Constitution of a newly independent Singapore had set the tone of what was to come. Article 152 says it is the responsibility of the Government ""constantly to care for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore"".
It also recognises the ""special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore"".
Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had, in 1965, promised to build a multiracial nation. He said on Aug 9 that year: ""This is not a Malay nation; this is not a Chinese nation; this is not an Indian nation. Everyone will have his place, equal: language, culture, religion.""
He also rebuffed language agitators who were lobbying for a constitutional guarantee of the status of the Chinese language in spite of assurances that all four major languages are official and equal.
But developments in neighbouring countries continued to have some effect in the early years. When severe rioting between Malays and Chinese broke out in Kuala Lumpur on May 13, 1969, tensions spilled over, but the authorities acted quickly to contain the disturbance.
POLICIES BEAR FRUIT
Various policies implemented over the years have enabled the peaceful co-existence that Singapore has come to be known for today - the Republic emerged top out of 142 countries in the annual Legatum Prosperity Index, released last week, for tolerance of ethnic minorities.
A bilingual policy was started in 1966, with English becoming the lingua franca. And in 1970, the Presidential Council for Minority Rights was established to scrutinise laws, so as to ensure there is no discrimination against any ethnic minority groups.
To ensure adequate minority representation in Parliament, the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) system has been in place since 1988. It requires political parties to field at least one minority candidate in each GRC team.
The Housing Board in 1989 also introduced the Ethnic Integration Policy that mandates a quota for minorities in HDB estates, so as to prevent racial enclaves from forming.
Although economic growth had benefited Singaporeans from all communities, by the 1980s, Malay community leaders were concerned that theirs was lagging behind in education. This led to the formation of self-help group Mendaki to help lift the community.
In the 1990s, other ethnic-based self-help groups were set up - the Singapore Indian Development Association (Sinda), the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) and the Eurasian Association. There have been questions over the need for such self-help groups, but the Government has said it would not be a good idea for them to merge or operate under one umbrella. This is because certain community problems can be dealt with only by leaders from those communities.
It is still a work in progress - there are concerns that while the Malay community has made many strides, they still lag behind in areas like education and employability. To its credit, Mendaki has made much progress in helping the community through programmes catering to lower-income groups.
The ethnic-centric focus of the four self-help groups, however, has not stopped them from joining forces to help the wider community. They recently said they will set up a joint venture to run 30 school-based student care centres to better support the holistic development of children, especially those from less-advantaged backgrounds, by tapping the resources of all the groups.
This, in a sense, is a microcosm of Singapore, which pledges to be colour-blind in its meritocracy and economic growth by providing opportunities for all. And for the most part, Singaporeans have been happy to share the fruits of the Government's economic growth policies and not rock the boat.
A study on race by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) and OnePeople.Sg in 2013 found that more than 90 per cent of the 2,000-plus Chinese respondents said they were comfortable with Indians and Malays as neighbours and employees - and about 85 per cent as close friends.
PUSHBACK BY MINORITIES
Yet as the country becomes more affluent and the racial wounds of decades past are increasingly forgotten, some are voicing dissatisfaction at other racial groups, and their views are amplified by social media.
This has also generated a pushback, notably from minorities. Independent scholar and activist Sangeetha Thanapal has used the term ""Chinese privilege"" to refer to behaviour of Singaporean Chinese, which she says is akin to ""White privilege"" in Western countries - not being able to see things from the viewpoint of others who are not in the majority.
Sociologist Mathew Mathews of the IPS also observes in a recent commentary that some minority Singaporeans are not comfortable in their own skin. He says: ""They are more likely to be sensitive to the fact that they have physical attributes and cultural practices which differ from those of the majority. Minorities often consider how those of the majority view them.""
And time and again, cracks have appeared. At least 16 people have been investigated, either under the Sedition Act or the Penal Code, for race or religion-related offences in the last 10 years.
This, after the section of the Sedition Act making it an offence ""to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population"" had been dormant from its inception in 1948 until 2005.
In 2012, former National Trades Union Congress employee Amy Cheong was sacked for her online diatribe against Malay weddings in void decks, and she fled to Australia after the resulting furore.
Some criticised the authorities' reaction in these cases as heavy-handed, but officials have always been mindful that isolated incidents can easily get out of control.
And two years ago, they did: the death of a foreign worker run over by a bus in Little India sparked a riot by about 300 people. In the process, 54 officers and eight civilians were hurt, 23 emergency vehicles were damaged, including five that were torched. It was contained within a few hours, and while the riot was not linked to race, some of the ensuing online rhetoric vilified the South Asian rioters on account of their race.
Just last week, a Facebook post that was critical about the Malay language drew a stern rebuke from Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP Zainal Sapari, who wrote: ""In today's age, racism is beyond basic comprehension and should not be allowed to take root in our society.""
That these sentiments are hidden under the surface of a seemingly cohesive society is a sign that Singapore, despite the progress made, is ""nowhere near being a race-blind society"", says law don Eugene Tan, who has done research on ethnic relations here.
""Bubbling beneath our civil veneer, there are prejudices and stereotypes which occasionally surface to trigger bouts of soul-searching,"" adds ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute sociologist Terence Chong.
Starkly, the 2013 study also made headlines for the finding that more than one in two Singaporeans did not have a close friend of another race.
""We have sound principles in place but practice and realisation is the real challenge in some domains more than others,"" says social anthropologist Lai Ah Eng of the National University of Singapore.
""Some people and groups are downright ignorant and biased, others merely tolerate, but others are proactive in understanding and being appreciative.""
As Singapore moves forward, it should seek to reduce the number of those in the first category and expand on those in the last.

","   Seven years ago last week, the United States elected its first black President.
Mr Barack Obama's historic win got Singaporeans thinking: When, if ever, will Singapore be ready for a non-Chinese prime minister?
This question was put to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong days after the win. His reply: that he thought it was possible, but it may not happen soon. He also acknowledged that attitudes towards race had shifted as English provided more of a common ground.
This was reiterated by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam this year: ""It seems to me inevitable that, at some point, a minority prime minister - Indian, Malay, Eurasian, or some mixture - is going to be a feature of the political landscape.
""We've got a meritocracy, it is an open system.""
He noted that people share experiences like national service and are educated largely in English.
Thought leader Ho Kwon Ping, who is the first Institute of Policy Studies S R Nathan Fellow for the Study of Singapore, believes the country will accept a non-Chinese prime minister put forward by a ""leading party"" like the People's Action Party (PAP).
He added, speaking at a public lecture in April: ""I honestly believe, and I hope to be naive enough to believe, that if that person was of calibre, we would accept this.""
Indeed, the issue of race hardly figured during the recent general election. And a post-election survey of voters by the Institute of Policy Studies, released last week, showed that 83 per cent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the ethnicity of the candidate they chose was not an important consideration.
However, several opposition candidates, like the Singapore Democratic Party's Mr Damanhuri Abas, did call for greater representation of Malays in sensitive combat positions within the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).
Most Singaporeans may not give much thought to such issues - which observers refer to as ""legacy"" ones that should be carefully managed - on a day-to-day basis. But they are likely to continue to crop up as national issues at times.
Take the perception of under-representation of Malays in the SAF. Mr Damanhuri's comments prompted the PAP's Dr Maliki Osman, who is now Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs, to reply: ""Our Malay servicemen have been recognised year after year, quietly and based on their competency.""
Dr Maliki also noted that Malay SAF officers now hold various vocations, including commandos, armour officers, pilots and naval combat systems operators.
Former Nominated MP Eugene Tan, a law professor who has researched ethnic relations, tells Insight that despite the great strides made by Malay servicemen in the SAF, a perception persists that security matters are oriented on race, given Singapore's position in a predominantly Malay neighbourhood.
Prof Tan says: ""Where the Malay/Muslim servicemen are concerned, national service as an institution of multiracialism, if not carefully managed, could accentuate perceptions of a less-than-inclusive multiracialism.
""This is why it is important to continue to work on strengthening the national identity so that the concerns that sectarian loyalties will trump civic, national ones, will be less challenging.""
Looking at the big picture, ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute sociologist Terence Chong sees a challenge in ""preventing ethnic divisions from being a proxy for class divisions"".
""In Singapore, the Malay community is still over-represented in prisons, drug rehab centres and financial assistance schemes,"" he tells Insight. ""The reasons for this are complex but the result obvious - there are relatively fewer of them in the middle class.""
Several Indian Singaporeans have also voiced concerns about a divide in the community between the well-off and those who lag behind in areas like education and employment, noting that minority Singaporeans tend to be over-represented in certain lower-paying service-sector jobs.
Moving forward, one potential issue is the lack of racial diversity in many boardrooms, says Chua Chu Kang GRC MP Zaqy Mohamad. While he does not expect the imposition of any quotas, he believes that the conversation - largely centred on gender equality today - could still shift to include race as well.
Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP Janil Puthucheary says that the form and nature of race-based challenges will continue to change over time.
The rise of online interactions is both a platform and a ""trigger for behaviour"" as the time between a comment and the reaction has shortened, says Dr Janil, who chairs OnePeople.Sg, the national body focused on promoting racial and religious harmony.
""So there will always be a need to remind ourselves and our children about the need for tolerance and understanding. To go further towards through (to) harmony and not stop at tolerance,"" he adds.
Meanwhile, humanities lecturer Nazry Bahrawi of the Singapore University of Technology and Design also sees fault lines increasingly being drawn along sociopolitical orientations - such as over greater acceptance of homosexuality.
With all these issues in mind, Singapore cannot be lulled into a false sense of security given its relative state of harmony today.
""Our stability and harmony cannot be founded on the shallow foundations of tolerance,"" Prof Tan says. ""We really need to go beyond tolerance and forbearance to seek genuine understanding, recognition, and protection of the diversity that is an integral part of Singapore.""
Nonetheless, Singapore's move to sign the United Nations convention to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination is significant, and will boost Singapore's standing in the international community.
There may be some policies on race that could be deemed by others as at odds with this commitment - but the Government also has the opportunity to make known its position on these areas, and make the point that they have the overall aim of preserving racial harmony.
As Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob said last month: ""The signing of this convention attests to our confidence and the strength of our race relations here, as member states signing this convention will have to submit reports regularly and be subject to UN scrutiny.
""We are already practising the principles enunciated under the convention, so signing it is a logical step.""
But addressing matters of race, and tackling discrimination, cannot be about the authorities alone, even though they play a key role.
Mr Baey Yam Keng, Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth, tells Insight: ""We recognise the need to continually review and adjust our policies, in consultation with the community, if changes are warranted.""
""We would like to call on every Singaporean to do his part, too, to strengthen racial harmony and combat racial discrimination. Together, we can ensure that racial discrimination will have no place in Singapore; and that our future generations will value and respect diversity.""

","   More than a quarter of the doctors in the public healthcare sector are foreigners.
At the end of last year, public hospitals and polyclinics had more than 2,100 foreign doctors in their employ, and the number continues to grow as Singapore faces a shortage of trained medical staff.
Most are primary care doctors with only 477 foreign specialists, a spokesman for the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) told The Straits Times.
In contrast, the private sector had only 156 doctors who were neither Singapore citizens nor permanent residents, according to the SMC's 2014 annual report.
To meet the demand for doctors, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has worked with the Education Ministry to raise the number of students accepted into medical schools here from 350 in 2012 to 460 this year.
MOH also tries to attract Singaporeans who are midway through their medical studies abroad to return to work here, by offering to pay up to $50,000 a year for their final three years of study.
In return, they need to work at a public hospital for three to four years, including their training year as housemen.
But a spokesman for MOH added: ""Even as we grow the local supply of medical professionals, we will need to augment our local medical workforce with qualified medical professionals from abroad.""
To ease them into the local environment, hospitals organise programmes to familiarise them with the local culture and behaviour as well as clinical practice. They also offer classes in local languages.
The MOH spokesman added that public institutions ensure a good mix of local and foreign staff in each shift and, in some cases, also provide interpreters to reduce any risk of miscommunication.
Among the public sector doctors who are Singaporeans or permanent residents, more than 1,800 were trained overseas.
Among them are the 615 who have taken up MOH's offer to sponsor part of the cost in their final years at a foreign university.
Said the spokesman: ""The demand for healthcare services is expected to rise substantially with an ageing population, coupled with changing disease patterns arising from lifestyles and diets.""
Dr Lee Chien Earn, chief executive officer of Changi General Hospital (CGH), said: ""Even as we grow and train our local medical professionals, there may be areas to selectively fill unmet or critical shortages with suitably qualified doctors from abroad.
""Besides mandatory supervision by senior doctors, the hospital has put in place training programmes to fit them into our local clinical practice and our cultural context to enable them to practise competently.""
Last year, CGH hired 35 new specialists, of whom eight were foreigners.
Many foreign doctors, after working here for several years, have come to like Singapore so much that they have become permanent residents or citizens.
Associate Professor Thoedoros Kofidis, a senior cardiothoracic surgeon at the National University Hospital, is originally from Greece. In Singapore since 2006 and a citizen since 2013, he said he identifies strongly with Singaporean values, especially meritocracy.
Before planting his roots here, he worked in Germany, Switzerland and the United States.
Dr Kofidis and his wife and daughter find it comfortable living here and have no problems making friends.
He also has a good rapport with patients, even those whom he needs a translator's help to communicate with.
He said: ""When I can't communicate verbally, I do it with gestures. I try not to be 'sterile'.""
His colleague Anita Lim, a senior rheumatologist who was born in Brunei and trained in Britain, said: ""I've been here for a decade. It's become home.
""Becoming a citizen was a natural progression.""

",NA,"   It is apposite that the Future of Us exhibition should round up celebrations marking 50 years of independent Singapore. There is a sense in which Singaporeans have lived in the future since 1965. Nothing but a shared belief in the beneficial possibilities of change could have convinced the citizens of an unlikely country to confront the challenges of independence. Those ranged from the vital loss of the economic hinterland represented by Malaysia, to the uncertainties of a city-state's political survival in the global Cold War contest between communism and democracy. What mattered then was visionary leadership, which fired the imagination of Singaporeans and made them invest their collective energies in the future.
The Future of Us exhibition projects half a century of credible belief in progress onto coming eras. Technology will continue to play a definitive role in the process. Hardly anyone in the 1970s could have thought that Singapore's transport options would be transformed by the advent of the MRT, but the train system, for all its problems, has become an accepted fact of life today. Buildings have edged closer to the skies, to the point where a four-storey edifice, which would have been considered high-rise once, is now a throwback to a low-rise past. In the decades to come, scientific advances and technological ingenuity will redraw the landscape in a way that will make today's achievements appear passe.
Yet, the enabling hand of science and technology that raises living standards will need to be matched by the grasp of the social imagination to widen the scope of national life. That complementarity of material advances and social advancement should be a motif of the SGfuture dialogues, which are about the quest of a society worth building in the next 50 years. Singapore will need to strike a new balance between the needs of development and those of the environment, for example. The economic and ecological limits of consumerism are a subset of that search for a sustainable balance. Questions of ethnic space and social cohesion could be looked at anew, as could issues of moving towards a broader-based system of meritocracy. Deliberations at the dialogues would do well to reflect Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's declaration that Singapore's future would depend on what Singaporeans make of it together. Cultural diversity is a strength in this respect because it allows Singaporeans to discover and entrench the common spaces that embody their overlapping identities of race, religion and economic function.
As a public engagement exercise, the SGfuture dialogues could emulate the open and inclusive spirit of the Our Singapore Conversation process, which concluded two years ago. Singaporeans owe it to themselves to participate in charting the national destiny. The future begins now.

",NA,"   What do penicillin, pacemakers and polyethylene plastics have in common? All were accidents in the laboratory, but are now considered among the most important discoveries and inventions of the past 70 years or so.
But what if the brains behind these finds had worked in a place where such accidents were discouraged and errors not tolerated?
""Imagine Alexander Fleming saying, 'Oh no, I just made an error, let me wipe this off quickly.' He would never have detected penicillin,"" said Professor Michael Frese of the NUS Business School .
Prof Frese, who has been studying this issue for the last 30 years, six of them here, said that Singapore, alongside his home country, Germany, is one of the most error-intolerant nations in the world.
""Singapore is often proud that it is intolerant (of errors),"" said the head of the Management and Organisation Department at the school, who has done extensive research on organisational behaviour and work psychology.
""This is a hallmark of Singapore that 'we do not tolerate any deviation from the norm',"" he told The Straits Times.
As a small nation lacking natural resources, Singapore's most valuable asset is human capital. The country prides itself on an error-free work culture and has a national ethos that upholds high standards.
""We are taught the importance of being the best, measured by our results,"" said Mr Tan Toi Chia , a consultant at leadership advisory Heidrick and Struggles. ""The idea of errors does not sit comfortably with being successful.""
And this emphasis on meritocracy continues into work life. Some argue this approach is a national asset.
Imagine the damage to Singapore's reputation as a logistics hub if items intended for Australia ended up in Austria due to an error, said Ms Stella Tang, managing director of human resources firm Robert Half, who sees error-intolerance as a strength, not a weakness.
""The country's economy relies on industries - like financial services, accounting, technology - that require a high level of precision and where errors can result in loss of time and money,"" she said.
Ms Linda Teo, country manager of Manpower Group, agreed. National corporate icons such as Singapore Airlines and Changi Airport would not be ""where they are if we had accepted a high margin for error"".
Prof Frese said his experiments, which included research in 61 countries, typically found that while everyone makes errors, people learn better if they accept that they do so.
""People who are allowed to make errors and learn from them perform better,"" he said, which could be because they not only discovered new ways to complete the task, but also reflected on what went wrong, which leads to deeper learning. Error tolerance also leads to more creativity and innovation, he said.""When you walk around an area, and try to go into an alleyway you have not seen, you might find a footpath that was not in any map.""
Ms Teo agreed that while not all errors will lead to innovation, they need to be tolerated at some level to enable people to learn. ""In today's work environment, learning on the go - and making mistakes along the way - is the fastest way for employees to learn the ropes,"" she said.
Mr Tan stressed the need to celebrate the effort to innovate without the fear of failure, which would then lead to ""the courage to experiment more and be innovation leaders"".
Prof Frese's study also found that companies tend to be more profitable over time if they are error-tolerant. For example, if a travel company employee makes an error with a client's itinerary and the work culture is such that he is encouraged to correct it immediately, the company, as well as the client, will benefit.
In doing so, the firm has also gained the client's trust, he said.
Prof Frese encouraged prompt management of errors to prevent them turning into a catastrophe.
Ms Teo agreed. ""Bosses may have to be more tolerant of mistakes, provided they are not serious breaches of ethics or operations. Employers who insist on an autocratic approach will lose out as they will not be able to attract or retain top talent who prefer organisations which foster a culture of innovation.""
But Ms Tang believes poorer performance may not benefit Singapore companies. She, however, does not see the need to punish or humiliate such workers. ""Singaporeans are very responsible employees and when they realise they have made an error, they tend to fix it and move on.""

264,"[...]the need for interventionist public policy.

"," Opinion
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Public policy; Public housing
","   Singapore's ability to build and maintain what can only be called national neighbourhoods lies at the heart of its untiring efforts to sustain social resilience. Unlike neighbourhoods elsewhere, which often are carved out by the divisive geography of economic and ethnic segregation, the Housing Board precinct bears testimony to the guiding principle of social inclusiveness. Certainly, the HDB estate is not seamless terrain. Working- class, middle-class, socially-aspiring and dysfunctional families all exist there. However, the fact that they coexist, sharing common areas and enjoying access to amenities open to all, justifies viewing the public housing estate as a microcosm of Singapore.
In drawing attention to the integrative role of housing in creating Singapore's social landscape, at a Washington conference recently, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam highlighted as well the macrocosm within which socially-unifying institutions such as housing have to function. The chief challenge to public policy today is being mounted by global economic forces which are widening income gaps within nations even as they create more wealth worldwide. Singapore's close integration into the global economy translates into a corresponding vulnerability to economic disparities growing within itself.
Hence the need for interventionist public policy. If the Government is unresponsive to disparities, the public will vote against it. If it veers towards populism, the market will punish it. Striking the correct balance at the right moment is crucial. The issue is not a battle between Left and Right, for these notions are not cast in ideological stone. The HDB itself is proof that what was considered left-wing once can become an unremarkable fact of life in moderate times. Singapore's extensive public housing was unabashedly socialist at inception, verging on the effective nationalisation of vast swathes of private land. Today, it continues to not only exist but also expand in a country marked by the largely free play of market forces. Indeed, confounding neat ideological dichotomies, the HDB has become a default feature of a market economy.
What matters is that the political centre must hold. It can do so only if it gives succeeding generations of citizens a stake in the collective life of their nation. Investment in education, healthcare and tripartite labour programmes serves to anchor Singaporeans in a single national destiny. Meritocracy, tempered with compassion, keeps pathways of mobility open to all and helps prevent entrenched interests from replicating their power, generation after generation. Multi- racialism makes a fundamental statement of Singapore's national character. These tested aspects of the Singapore system must remain the bedrock of public policies to take it further.

","   This was a year of celebration, commemoration and reflection for Singapore, the nation that founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew described as ""improbable (and) unlikely"".
When Singapore was thrust into independence in 1965, following its expulsion from the Malaysian Federation, few believed it would overcome the economic, geopolitical and demographic forces lined up against it.
It was a little red dot in a dangerous part of the world, without natural resources or an army of its own. And its people, made up of recent immigrants, had a history of communal tensions.
But today, 50 years on, the nation that should not have been is not only a beacon of what determination and grit can make possible, but also a symbol of defying the odds and overcoming vulnerabilities.
In five decades, Singapore has transformed from a Third World entrepot into a First World metropolis, with gross domestic product per capita soaring 100 times from US$500 (S$708) at independence to US$56,000 this year.
And Singaporeans of different races, religious beliefs and ethnicities enjoy relative peace and harmony in a multiracial society. It would make any nation strut with pride.
Singapore was no different. For 12 months, the country basked in the glory of its achievements, with a long list of SG50 activities. From mega-ticket events such as the SEA Games and National Day Parade to community activities led by Singaporeans, almost every child, teenager, working adult and senior was bitten by the SG50 bug.
The celebratory mood was further enhanced when Singaporeans were given an extra public holiday on Aug 7. It made for an extended Jubilee weekend over four days - from Aug 7 to 10 - for Singaporeans to ""commemorate this special milestone year in our history"", said President Tony Tan Keng Yam when announcing the public holiday.
In fact, the SG50 Steering Committee set up to plan the Golden Jubilee festivities had started its work two years before, in 2013.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in unveiling the committee then, had said: ""Fifty years is a milestone, I don't think we should just have a fireworks display and a party.""
The celebration was meant to be a unifying force for Singaporeans to identify as one people.
By the time the country celebrated its birthday on Aug 9, there was a palpable sense of patriotic pride in the air. Singaporeans cheered, sang and teared at the three-hour-long extravaganza at the Padang, where the first post-independence National Day Parade was held in 1966.
Spectators were treated to an unprecedented formation of 20 F-16 fighter jets flying at 600kmh, forming the number 50.
There was also a vintage parade segment, featuring pioneer policemen, nurses, firemen and soldiers in uniforms they wore during parades in the 1960s.
But a tinge of sadness marked the celebratory mood as people mourned the death of founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who died in March, aged 91.
This year's National Day was the first since independence without Mr Lee in the stands.
His absence, however, made hearts grow fonder of the many moments associated with the man and reminded Singaporeans of the values of multiracialism, meritocracy and equality which he stood for.
Amid the celebration, a growing sense of national identity emerged and Singapore, often in search of itself, seemed to shed some of its existential angst.
Nowhere was this more obvious than during a segment of the parade in which some uniquely Singaporean traits - which were once considered undesirable - were trotted out as proud symbols of the Singaporean identity.
There was a giant tissue packet with the word ""chope"", or reserve, acknowledging the habit of using tissue packets to reserve seats at hawker centres, and a giant squid with the words ""blur like sotong"", giving a nod to the Singlish phrase to describe a person's confusion.
SG50 paraphernalia had also become coveted items for many.
This year, goodie bags, typically given to those attending the National Day Parade, were handed out to all 1.2 million Singaporean and permanent resident households.
The special SG50 funpack came in 50 different designs and contained nostalgic items such as childhood card games, erasers with country flags on them, and snacks such as muruku and haw flakes.
Despite the initial indifference that met the launch of the SG50 logo, Singaporeans were soon caught up in the SG50 whirl, buying T-shirts for their own Jubilee parties and decorating their cars with red dots made of foam.
It was perhaps fitting that the ""little red dot"" - coined by former Indonesian president B.J. Habibie, reportedly to remind Singapore of its place in the world - had been remade as a symbol of the nation's spirit, ""signifying that our dreams are not limited by the physical size of our island nation"", as the SG50 Steering Committee's website says.
In the end, some 1.7 million people turned up over the Jubilee Weekend, from Aug 7 to 10, to mark Singapore's coming of age.
As a testament to its diplomacy over the years, friends from around the world came for the celebrations.
Foreign dignitaries from 18 countries, including seven heads of state and government, were invited to this year's parade, a first since 1969.
They included Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak, Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha and New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key.
In November, Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a visit to Singapore, his first since becoming president, marking the 25th anniversary of Sino-Singapore ties.
In the same month, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the leader of Asia's biggest democracy, also made his first visit to Singapore to commemorate 50 years of diplomatic ties.
Singapore's President Tan, in turn, made state visits to several countries, including China, France and New Zealand.
Even before the year comes to a close, ever-pragmatic Singapore is already looking to SG100.
To keep the SG50 spirit going and to get Singaporeans working towards a shared future, the Government is holding the Future Of Us exhibition this month, and the SGfuture series of dialogues to start the journey into the next 50 years.
Opening the exhibition, PM Lee had said: ""It is up to each one of us to voice our hopes and future dreams, to make the choices to realise these dreams.""

1 Keeping markets calm despite rate hike
JANET YELLEN
FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN
When it came to influencing how financial markets behaved this year, nobody was more powerful than Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.
Each time she made a speech, pundits the world over would pore over every word to decipher any possible hidden meaning.
Dr Yellen, an academic who spent nearly two decades teaching at the University of California at Berkeley, learnt early on about the power she held and took on a cautious stance, both in policy and speech.
In the run-up to the Fed's key meeting in mid-December, she dropped plenty of hints beforehand that interest rates would rise - but gently, slowly, so that markets would not panic. And it worked.
When Dr Yellen announced on Dec 16 that the Fed was raising interest rates for the first time in almost a decade, by a quarter of a percentage point, markets were calm.
Emerging market shares, which had been battered by past speculation over the Fed lift-off, even rallied after the move.
Like any person in a position of power, Dr Yellen is not without her critics, including some within the Fed itself.
In October, notably, political activist Ralph Nader issued an open letter to Dr Yellen criticising her low interest rate policy and advising her to ""sit down with your Nobel Prize-winning husband, economist George Akerlof"".
Unruffled as always, Dr Yellen calmly replied, arguing why low interest rates have helped the US economy, making no mention of Mr Nader's sexist remark.
2 In the eye of the storm
JUDY HSU
STANCHART CEO
Standard Chartered Singapore's new chief executive has taken over the reins at a critical juncture.
Since her appointment became effective in October, the British lender has announced a major restructuring plan that will involve axing 15,000 jobs globally and raising US$5.1 billion (S$7.2 billion) in capital. But the former head of StanChart's global wealth management has the poise and experience to ride through the storm.
With a career spanning over 25 years in the financial industry, including the last 16 years in wealth management, retail banking and private banking, Ms Hsu is no rookie. In fact, StanChart Singapore is well placed to grow its business here.
In a statement to The Straits Times last month, she noted that StanChart's franchise in Singapore remains profitable, with a disciplined balance sheet and well-managed costs.
""We continue to be the second-largest contributor to the group and a major driver of the performance in Asean and South Asia. We have a long history of banking the growing and internationalising companies in our markets,"" Ms Hsu said.
""We remain committed to Singapore, and we are going to build on those strengths across our network.""
StanChart will also sharpen its focus on enhancing its retail banking and private banking, expanding its wealth management platform and building on its leadership in the digital banking space.
""We will continue to invest into strategic opportunities where we see a competitive advantage and where we can grow with less capital.""
Ms Hsu has already made senior management changes in Singapore, most notably appointing new heads for the bank's retail, transaction and commercial banking divisions.
3 An agent of change
LOH BOON CHYE
SGX CHIEF
When the veteran banker took on the role of Singapore Exchange's (SGX) chief executive in July, he surely knew what a big job awaited him.
The SGX has not only been hit by technological mishaps in the past couple of years, but is also suffering from market malaise, with trading activity this year slowing to a trickle amid a turbulent global economic backdrop and constant guessing over when the United States Federal Reserve would raise interest rates.
But Mr Loh, 51, is no stranger to the SGX - he was a director from 2003 to 2012 and his 26 years in the financial services industry would have left him in good stead to steer the bourse into next year and beyond. Mr David Gerald, president and chief executive of the Securities Investors Association (Singapore), said it is ""particularly pleased to see the SGX board appointing a Singaporean to succeed Mr (Magnus) Bocker"", a Swede.
Mr Loh faces many challenges. Besides reviving anaemic trading volumes and ensuring no more market outages, he must also look at how to woo more initial public offerings (IPO): The IPO scene this year was lacklustre, with just one mainboard debutante. His job is made tougher by the fact that it is likely to be a rough trading environment next year as interest rates rise and the economic outlook remains murky. But Mr Loh is already spearheading changes.
The bourse is studying ways to encourage institutional investors to be more engaged and to move towards reducing the number of company disclosures while giving them greater value.
The SGX wants institutional investors to engage investee companies and exercise their voting rights appropriately as a way of fostering sustainable growth and value creation that will benefit all shareholders.
4 Daring to let 'baby' go
LINCOLN CHENG
ZOUK FOUNDER
When the Zouk founder said he was selling his club to Genting Hong Kong, it felt like the end of an era for many. Since it opened in 1991, Zouk has become one of the world's hippest nightclubs and a rite of passage for countless Singaporeans.
The sale also marks a new chapter for 68-year-old Mr Cheng, who said he was cashing out so he could spend more time with his 11-year-old daughter, after having taken Zouk ""from a baby to a fully mature adult"". The sum was undisclosed when the purchase by Genting Hong Kong was announced in October, but the Zouk brand and its business were valued at $40 million in a 2013 audit.
Zouk has been consistently ranked among the top clubs in the world and still draws around 10,000 revellers each week. These numbers stand as a testament to Mr Cheng's vision - bidding for three dilapidated warehouses in Jiak Kim Street in 1990 and then turning them into Singapore's first commercial dance club, bringing electronic music to the forefront in the process.
His two business partners even suggested that he convert part of the club's space into a KTV lounge, but he refused to budge from his vision, and eventually bought them out when an agreement could not be reached. Even so, in a farewell speech to staff in October, he acknowledged that the club's success had been a team effort, and gave every employee between $400 and $800 out of his own pocket.
""I think I have done my best, we have done our best... At my age, 68, I don't think I can bring it any higher,"" he said.
""I should step down and pass the baton to the next generation. The next generation can bring Zouk worldwide.""
5 Overnight millionaire
SHIRLEY SENG
REAL ESTATE AGENT
It had all the ingredients of a heart-warming story - a young person from a humble background who made good, driven by a desire to provide for her family.
Not surprisingly, Shirley Seng's story was among The Straits Times' most widely read and shared this year. The 26-year-old made headlines in April when she became an overnight millionaire - she sold a penthouse at Le Nouvel Ardmore for a record $51 million, reaping a commission of about $1.5 million.
No mean feat at all - especially since the PropNex agent joined this line against her family's wishes.
But what could have been a simple story about a property transaction was lifted by Ms Seng's personal story, which painted a portrait of a clear-eyed, grounded and professional young individual.
One snippet: ""I still sleep in the living room of a terraced house in Serangoon, where I live with my parents, grandparents, two sisters, four other relatives and one maid.""
And despite her youth, her maturity shone through in her work ethic, as she described how she made it a point to attend to clients within an hour or two, and even run errands for them to make them feel special.
""Times are tough, unlike 10 or 20 years ago. Today's agents need to do more for their clients. But you need to do it with your heart, so they can feel your sincerity,"" she said.
And forget sappy, inspirational quotes about doing what you love and loving what you do.
Ms Seng kept it real: ""I often get people asking me if it is money that drives me. I tell them that many people are motivated by money, especially when they come from a poor background. I work hard to give my family a good life.""
6 S'porean coup in private banking
EDMUND KOH
HEAD OF UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT ASIA PACIFIC
Private banking is not an easy trade these days. Competition is keen and tightening regulations have made it ever costlier to do business.
But somehow banking veteran Edmund Koh, with his easy charm and relaxed manner, makes running the Singapore operations of a major Swiss bank look effortless. This year, however, news readers got a hint of how hard Mr Koh works when Swiss private bank UBS announced they were giving him even more responsibilities, by naming him the head of UBS Wealth Management Asia Pacific.
The 55-year-old is the first Singaporean to hold the post. UBS is the largest wealth manager in the world and in Asia-Pacific by invested assets and has more than 2,000 staff in 13 locations across the region. As at the end of last year, UBS was managing assets worth 269 billion Swiss francs (S$382.5 billion) in the Asia-Pacific.
Mr Koh faces a far from easy task and will have to prove he can deliver, as UBS turns its focus to Asia as its growth driver in the years ahead.
Not surprisingly, Mr Koh, who is also a member of the UBS Global Wealth Management executive board, feels strongly about grooming a new batch of Singaporean bankers who can fill the top jobs.
Still, he told The Straits Times in an interview earlier this year that he is clear-eyed about the need for meritocracy above all. ""But as a financial centre, let's not get too carried away about not hiring foreigners. I'm a Singaporean, and you've got to earn it,"" he said.
He speaks from experience: He was a marketing and public affairs manager at HSBC who moved up the ranks to become DBS Bank's regional head of consumer banking. He was president of Ta Chong Bank for 31/2 years, where he was credited with making the Taiwanese bank profitable, before joining UBS in 2012.
7 Yahoo! It's been a good year... maybe
MARISSA MAYER
YAHOO CEO
It has either been a very good or very bad year for Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer, depending on your point of view. The 40-year-old welcomed a double bundle of joy when she gave birth to twins in September. But she was back at work in two weeks, continuing with the struggle to turn around the Internet giant's flailing business while battling shareholders who were turning up the heat on the former Google executive.
Shareholders complained that three years after being brought in to turn things around, Ms Mayer, who is among Silicon Valley's best-paid executives with a package worth US$42 million (S$59 million) last year, has not shown any progress.
Just earlier this month, an investment fund with a stake in Yahoo called for the firm to slash more than 80 per cent of its workforce and replace Ms Mayer.
The investment fund also argued that Yahoo has frittered away billions of dollars during Ms Mayer's tenure on research or acquisitions that have not paid off.
Some are vexed that she has retreated from Yahoo's earlier plan to spin off its multibillion-dollar stake in Chinese e-commerce colossus Alibaba. The backtracking means that Yahoo will likely have to sell off its core online business instead.
But analysts say the 22nd most powerful woman in the world - at least according to Forbes magazine - still has one more year to improve Yahoo's core business and prepare it for its inevitable sale.
No doubt all eyes will be on whether she can pull off what many now believe to be an impossible task.
2015 may have been a rollercoaster ride for Ms Mayer, but 2016 will likely be the real test of her mettle.
8 Birth of postal poster child
WOLFGANG BAIER
SINGPOST CHIEF
Even if he had not announced his shock resignation earlier this month, SingPost chief executive Wolfgang Baier would still have made The Straits Times' list of top 10 newsmakers in business.
In the four years since taking the helm, the 41-year-old former McKinsey consultant has forced the world to take notice of what used to be a simple mail delivery firm.
It's no longer stamps and letters that people associate with the 200-year-old firm, but cutting-edge e-commerce logistics.
This year alone, the firm has invested in a New Zealand freight forwarder, an e-commerce provider and an e-commerce logistics firm in the US and a joint venture to import and supply goods to e-commerce and online retailers in Indonesia. It also rolled out a service for small and medium-sized enterprises that lets them outsource the inventory management and order fulfilment parts of their online businesses. To cap it all off, it tested mail delivery by drone in October.
The plans Dr Baier put in place have paid off, with SingPost gaining international acclaim for being a poster child of how a firm in a traditional industry can stay relevant in an increasingly digital world.
And it has caught the eye of big names, notably Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, which invested about $279 million to raise its holding in SingPost and buy a stake in SingPost unit Quantium Solutions International.
It is no surprise then that the market reacted negatively to Dr Baier's resignation - SingPost shares dropped to a two-month low two days after he called it quits, saying he was ""pursuing new endeavours"".
9 Donning multiple hats
PUA SECK GUAN
WILMAR INTERNATIONAL CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
It is not every day that the chief executive officer of one mainboard-listed firm is named the chief operating officer of another.
Without leaving his current role, Mr Pua Seck Guan, CEO of Perennial Real Estate Holdings, is taking on the posts of COO and executive director at agri-business giant Wilmar International, it was announced this month.
It is a testament to Mr Pua's skills and experience in growing businesses in different markets, Wilmar CEO Kuok Khoon Hong said. With the association with Perennial through Mr Pua, Wilmar could take on property development projects, with Wilmar maybe taking a small stake, he added.
The news capped off what was an exciting year for Perennial and Mr Pua, a former CapitaLand executive. In October, the firm received overwhelming demand for its three-year retail bonds, which offer an annual payout of 4.65 per cent. The bonds were about 4.1 times subscribed based on the initial launch of $150 million, leading Perennial to raise the amount available for subscription under the public offer tranche to $200 million.
Earlier in the year, the firm made its first foray into Africa, through a joint venture with Shangri-La Asia to develop a 49,874 sq m site in the Ghanaian capital of Accra into a prime integrated mixed-use development.
It also entered into a joint venture in July to develop and manage medical service businesses in China. It kicked things off by acquiring Modern Hospital Guangzhou, one of the leading tumour and cancer hospitals in Guangzhou.
10 Staying firm amid drama
RICHARD ELMAN
NOBLE GROUP FOUNDER CHAIRMAN
Embattled might not even begin to describe how Noble Group founder and chairman Richard Elman probably felt for much of this year.
The 75-year-old has come under fire as critics questioned the company's accounting methods, accusing the management of fraud and calling for his resignation.
It all started in February, when a blogger calling himself Iceberg Research drew attention to Noble's accounting methods, and the drama has hardly abated since.
Despite fighting back, Noble has drawn further detractors and short-sellers and become the most-shorted stock in the Straits Times Index.
In June, former Morgan Stanley banker Michael Dee released an open letter questioning the ethics and competence of Noble's management and called on Mr Elman to resign.
Mr Elman, who began his career as a scrap metal trader before starting Noble in 1987 and building it into a global behemoth, has stood by his firm and worked to silence its critics and mend its reputation.
The firm hired PwC to review its term contracts, valuations and the relevant corporate governance framework. The review concluded with the auditor finding Noble's accounting practices to be compliant with relevant standards.
Noble has sued Mr Arnaud Vagner, the person allegedly behind Iceberg. It will be some time before the suit is heard.
Standard & Poor's said in November it may cut Noble's debt rating to junk on liquidity concerns. Noble followed up earlier this month by saying it was in advanced talks to sell its agriculture unit to boost liquidity.

","   A measure of nostalgia would not be out of place on the last day of what to the rest of humankind is 2015, but for Singaporeans is simply SG50 year. Unlike countries that measure their history in millennia, Singapore can boast about 700 years. Contemporary Singapore was born close to 200 years ago, but it was only in 1965 that an orphaned city was forced into a statehood that might not have lasted and a nationhood that few thought possible. Yet, half a century from that august date of Aug 9, Singaporeans collectively cannot imagine that they will exist without this nation-state or it without them. Once, this land belonged to others. Today, Singaporeans belong to it. That is the supreme achievement of an improbable independence. SG50 celebrated citizenship as the art of the possible, honed over five decades of success that even other successful nations talk about.
Good judgment helped to steer Singapore away from the precipice that awaits nations which forget that the world does not owe them a living. The tripartite system, consisting of capital, labour and the state, produced a peaceful industrial climate. It drew foreign investment that enabled Singapore to leapfrog its immediate region and embed itself in the emerging geography of globalisation. Within the country, the meritocratic emergence of a broad middle class laid the basis of political stability. Reiteration of Singapore's historical legacy as a multiracial country resulted in the appearance of anchoring social spaces that were far more powerful than centrifugal attachment to ancestral homelands. The role of national service in the formation of a people's army deterred those who harboured notions of Singapore as lost ethnic territory to be recovered by sudden force or patient attrition.
That these enduring features of the national landscape should be taken for granted is not the problem: After all, a 50-year-old record of resilience cannot be the cause of surprise or even excitement. What would be dangerous would be the dismissal of the values that made independent Singapore viable. These ideals and values include a commitment to equality of all races and religions; a belief in meritocracy and good governance; the ability to see society, for all its faults, as the nurturing sphere of individual attainment; the family as the link between society and individual; an ethic of hard work and self-reliance as being superior to the crutches of welfare dependency; and the fruits of deferred gratification as the best legacy that one generation can leave for the next. Economic opportunities and social responses will change with time, but what will underpin society will be a primary attachment to the survivalist values that have brought it so far. Some wonder whether Singapore's best years are behind it. The answer will depend on the baton that the SG50 generation passes on.

","   Academic Elaine Ho feels it may be time to do away with the Government's model of classifying people by race.
The Chinese, Malay, Indian and Others (CMIO) classification, in place since the first Census in 1824, has been put to use in housing and education policies, noted the National University of Singapore's associate professor in geography.
""I think the CMIO model has served its purpose,"" she said.
Although a 2011 change allowed double-barrelled race classification for Singaporeans of mixed parentage, she would ""like to see these categorisations dissolved even more"".
With more inter-racial marriages and immigration, Singapore has become more diverse, she said, adding: ""I wonder if (CMIO) is still a good way to manage ethnicity and intersecting types of identities.""
But Acting Minister for Education (Schools) Ng Chee Meng said discarding the model runs the risk of impinging on minorities' rights.
STAYING UNITED DESPITE DIFFERENCES
In some sensitive issues, there may be no definitive consensus today even as we recognise that a new equilibrium may be needed in the future. What do we as a society need to do in that process? How can we be more resilient as 'one united people', harness strengths from our diversity, and not let it pull us apart?
MR NG CHEE MENG, Acting Minister for Education (Schools).
""When we, as the majority race in Singapore, want to blur it, then who would represent their interests?"" he said, asking how Singapore would design inclusive politics to make sure Malays and Indians are represented in Parliament.
Fellow panel speaker David Chan, director of the Singapore Management University's Behavioural Sciences Institute, also warned that some aspects of a person's identity cannot be chosen, and that policies should be careful not to land such people in particularly advantageous or disadvantageous situations.
He said: ""If we didn't want to talk about male or female (differences), there wouldn't be the Women's Charter. Similarly, if we don't want to talk about CMIO, what kind of policies would we be erasing?""
He did not think the CMIO model impedes national identity, citing surveys that show one ""can be very Malay and very Singaporean"" at the same time.
""I'm not saying everything is fine, but be careful what we're doing away with,"" he said.
The CMIO classification and gay rights were the leading topics during yesterday's panel discussion on cohesive diversity at the Institute of Policy Studies' annual conference.
Earlier, in a speech, Mr Ng underlined the need for inclusive policies and politics that help the country become ""one united people"".
While such policies will evolve as society matures, core elements such as education, meritocracy and the goal of leaving no Singaporean behind must remain, he said.
""As a society, Singaporeans must respect our differences and proactively defend our common spaces.''
As for gay rights, he urged patience in letting society come to its own consensus.
""It may not be satisfactory... but given human dynamics, sometimes time is a great resource,"" he said.
Rounding off the discussion, Mr Ng, a key member of the People's Action Party's fourth generation of leaders, said his generation would have to earn Singaporeans' trust with regard to their integrity, competence and ability.
""Hopefully, over time, our track record will allow us to continue this relationship, where inclusive politics would be necessary (for an) environment where we have all these diverse viewpoints... and in that conversation derive the energy and strength to position Singapore for SG100.""

"," Insight
"," The Straits Times; Singapore
"," Elections; Leadership; Parliaments
","   Singapore's trio of political siblings introduced more than 20 years ago - the Non-Constituency MP, Nominated MP and group representation constituency (GRC) schemes - may be due for an update.
The NCMP scheme turns 32 this year. GRCs were born 28 years ago, and the NMP scheme, 26 years ago.
These innovations have allowed alternative views to be aired, and ensured minority communities are not shut out, said President Tony Tan Keng Yam on Jan 15.
But they have also run into some unanticipated trends along the way that Singapore's leaders could not have envisioned in the 1980s.
Insight looks at what the Government could address in its review.
NON-CONSTITUENCY MPs
The NCMP scheme, which offers parliamentary seats to the best-performing losing opposition candidates, was first introduced in 1984.
There is one stark difference between then and now.
No opposition candidate had won a seat in the 16 years between December 1965, when 13 opposition Barisan Sosialis MPs walked out of Parliament, and 1981. Then, vocal critics such as the late Workers' Party (WP) leader, Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, said the scheme was an attempt to dissuade voters from electing opposition members.
But since the WP won five seats in Aljunied GRC and one in Hougang in the general elections in 2011 and last year, there have been six elected opposition MPs in the House. Ms Lee Li Lian's victory in the Punggol East by-election made it seven between 2013 and last year.
So today, the People's Action Party (PAP) is not the only party in the House.
But it is worth looking at whether this mechanism to ensure representation of alternative views in Parliament should remain or change with the political conditions of the day.
National University of Singapore (NUS) political scientist Reuben Wong is in two minds about it.
""In 1984, NCMPs came about because Singapore wanted to ensure alternative voices who would not be from the PAP. But the WP has won a GRC twice, so we don't really seem to need it any more.
""On the other hand, I'm not sure that the WP would continue to thrive without having NCMPs for exposure,"" he says, adding that the WP won Aljunied GRC last year ""by the skin of its teeth"" - 50.95 per cent of the vote share.
Another issue that appears to be coming to a head: the need for clearer public understanding about what happens when an NCMP seat has been declined.
The WP's Lee Li Lian turned down the seat offered to her for being the best performer among the losing candidates in the elections last year.
Party leaders have declared they want another of its office-holders, NUS sociology don Daniel Goh, to occupy the seat instead.
But it is not an automatic process that the next-in-line top losing opposition candidate is offered or entitled to the seat.
There has been no equivalent precedent for passing an NCMP seat within a party.
After the 1984 polls, the WP rejected the offer of an NCMP seat to its candidate M.P.D. Nair, who scored 48.8 per cent of votes in Jalan Kayu.
An offer was then made to the next-best loser, Singapore United Front candidate Tan Chee Kien, who also rejected it.
'DISASTER' FOR CHINESE
It would be a disaster for the Chinese community in Singapore if Singapore wakes up one day to find that we have an all-Chinese Parliament.
THEN DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GOH CHOK TONG IN 1988, on the need to guarantee a multiracial Parliament.
Leader of the House Grace Fu has shed light on the procedure, and on Parliament's role in the process, now that Ms Lee has declined to take it up. Ms Fu has said that the WP has to file a motion in Parliament to declare the seat and to propose an alternative candidate for the NCMP seat.
The WP did so on Jan 15 and the expected debate on it this week will help shed light on the NCMP scheme and the stance of parties towards it.
NOMINATED MPs
Since the NMP scheme was first adopted in 1990, nips and tucks to its limits have been made.
In 1997, the maximum number of NMPs was raised from six to nine, its current limit, and in 2002, an NMP's term was extended from two to 21/2 years. The scheme was also made permanent in 2010.
What has not changed is its purpose: to offer Singaporeans more opportunities for political participation and to evolve a more consensual style of government where alternative views are heard.
IMPROVE SELECTION PROCESS
Singaporeans don't know the identities of those seeking to be appointed NMPs as Parliament does not make it public.
SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT UNIVERSITY LAW DON EUGENE TAN, a former NMP himself, who says the selection process can be made more robust, transparent and accountable.
Observers such as NUS political scientist Hussin Mutalib still point to the need to consolidate greater citizen participation in politics.
But the way of doing this is less clear. Does the NMP scheme continue to be an appropriate way of doing this, or is it becoming obsolete with the rise of the Internet?
Social media and other mechanisms for public feedback, such as national conversations and the government feedback unit, may have diluted the need for the presence of NMPs in the House.
Society has also become more diverse but the seven functional groups represented by NMPs (business and industry, the professions, the labour movement, social and community organisations, media, arts and sports, tertiary education institutions, and civil society) have not changed.
Are the groups in need of an update?
Singapore Management University law don Eugene Tan, a former NMP himself, says that the selection process can be made more robust, transparent and accountable.
Currently, different functional groups have different processes and rules on nominating applicants for consideration by the Parliament's special select committee.
""Singaporeans don't know the identities of those seeking to be appointed NMPs as Parliament does not make it public,"" he says.
But Parliament does benefit from having views and ideas put forth by MPs who are not bound by party positions and the party whip, says Assoc Prof Tan. The NMP scheme also enables sensitive issues to be raised in Parliament, he says, citing immigration and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues.
GRCs
The main criticism of the GRC system is how much it has grown since it was set up in 1988. It began with 13 three-member GRCs. But the law was changed in 1991 and in 1996 to increase the maximum number of MPs per GRC from three to four, and then to six.
On one hand, leaders agree on the need to guarantee a multiracial Parliament. Said then Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in 1988: ""It would be a disaster for the Chinese community in Singapore if Singapore wakes up one day to find that we have an all-Chinese Parliament.""
While this had not happened in Singapore, he made the case for amending the Constitution to exclude this possibility in the future. Such multiracial teams would also act as a check on candidates who may be tempted to play the race card and exploit communal sentiments in order to win votes, he added.
But larger GRCs were criticised for increasing the chances of rookie PAP candidates riding into Parliament on the coat-tails of heavyweight candidates in their team.
Opposition parties also said the GRC requirements made it harder for them to field teams.
Observers say that the guarantee of a multiracial Parliament can still be achieved with smaller GRC sizes.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has acknowledged as much, having pledged as early as 2009 to reduce the average number of MPs in a GRC from 5.4 to five, and to increase the number of single-member constituencies (SMCs). These changes were introduced in the 2011 General Election, when the number of SMCs was raised from nine to 12.
The latest boundary changes now bring the average number of MPs in each GRC to 4.75, down from anaverage of five in 2011.
Two six-man GRCs remain: Ang Mo Kio and Pasir-Ris Punggol.
Each has two members of a minority race on its team: Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar and Mr Darryl David in Ang Mo Kio GRC; and Mr Zainal Sapari and Dr Janil Puthucheary in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.
NUS' Prof Hussin said it is worth looking at further reductions to the number and size of GRCs.
This would let more individuals contest SMCs on the basis of merit, he said. It would also go some way towards consolidating meritocracy and multiculturalism in Singapore, he added.

","   Physical education (PE) and art - these were the favourite subjects of Acting Ministers forEducation Ng Chee Meng and Ong Ye Kung.
In a recent interview with the Ministry of Education's Contact magazine for teachers, both ministers revealed a lighter side of themselves, as they talked about experiences in school and their growing-up years.
Mr Ng, who oversees pre-schools, primary and secondary schools, and the junior colleges, revealed that he enjoyed PE lessons and recess the most, not being ""the most studious type"" of student.
He was also active in co-curricular activities such as swimming and table tennis in primary school.
In secondary school, he joined the National Police Cadet Corps and trained to be a lifeguard. He also joined the Science Club, represented his school in taekwon-do and received his Private Pilot Licence through the Junior Flying Club - all in his two years at junior college.
In the newsletter published this month, Mr Ng said he was grateful for the chance to access ""good education and career opportunities"".
He went on to urge educators to let students have the space to make mistakes and think innovatively.
""Sometimes, it is okay to let them scrape their knees, or go on field camps and not shower for three days,"" he said. These experiences help them to be resilient and reduce students' fear of failure and let them take ""calculated risks"". This is crucial for Singapore's future success, he added.
Mr Ong, who oversees higher education and skills, said his younger days in school were not easy. He did not know how to read English until he was in Primary 3.
His family spoke only Mandarin at home, and he struggled with English when he was in Nanyang Primary and even later at Maris Stella High. His mother, who was a teacher, tried to teach him the language despite not being fluent herself in English.
""My mum was more hands-on with my studies and she wanted me to do well,"" said Mr Ong, who added that seeing his father work as a politician ""probably had a big part to play"" in guiding him towards his current vocation. His father was a former Barisan Sosialis MP.
Like Mr Ng, Mr Ong has fond memories of school, from playing volleyball and basketball, and being a long jumper in junior college. He also enjoyed art, sketching and painting, and won a few school art competitions along the way.
Mr Ong said parents play an important role in sending messages about success.
He and his wife focus more on supporting their two teenage daughters and giving them time to grow, and less on achieving good grades in school.
This is also his hope for education in Singapore, for the idea of meritocracy to be broadened, with ""merit"" as not just a number or grade.

","   Singapore needs to evolve to keep up with the changing world and cannot cling tight to the old ways that have brought the country to where it is today, said MPs in Parliament yesterday.
As the country enters its next phase of development, it should relook its economic growth strategies and style of making decisions, said Acting Education Minister (Higher Education and Skills) Ong Ye Kung.
Mr Ong, first of the next-generation leaders to speak in the debate on the President's Address, added: ""Evolution is absolutely necessary because no city stays successful by standing still. Animals develop sharper claws, longer beaks and harder shells in order to survive.""
Day One of debate on President's Address
- Mr Charles Chong and Mr Lim Biow Chuan elected Deputy Speakers
- MPs stress importance of strong military defence and social cohesion to guard against terrorism and regional tension
- Politics must be constructive rather than divisive if Singapore is to succeed, say MPs
- Workers' Party MP Sylvia Lim urges Government to scale back its presence in non-key areas to give room for alternative power centres and empower Singaporeans to take ownership of the country's direction
- Labour MP Desmond Choo proposes that working mothers get the option of eight weeks of flexible work arrangements, on top of the current 16 weeks of maternity leave
Likewise, Singapore must develop new traits to survive in a more complex and competitive world.
But as it evolves, it should hold fast to some principles, and he cited three: integrity, meritocracy and an openness to the world.
Mr Ong was among 17 MPs who spoke yesterday, the first day of the debate. Keenly aware of the global economic slowdown and the terrorism threat around the world, they suggested ways for Singapore to deal with these challenges.
Mr Ong noted that Singapore's top trading partner and export destination - China - is transforming its economy, with the focus shifting from growth to quality of growth. Also, it produces more of its own goods and imports less from South-east Asia, and this has hit Singapore exports.
Singapore needs to find its footing in this new configuration and look at China for new business opportunities, said Mr Ong.""We must be able to understand, bridge, and operate across different cultures. We must have depth in know-how and skills, so that wherever we go, our expertise is valued,"" he added.
Agreeing, Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang GRC) said this was crucial if Singapore was to keep growing in the ""global economic malaise"".
Amid these shifting sands, Singapore must make the right judgment calls. Mr Ong urged the Government to exercise greater discretion and adhere less strictly to rules, as ""the world is now too complex to be reduced to rules and numbers"".
Such changes are happening, he noted, citing how social assistance schemes are means-tested but each application is also qualitatively assessed. ""Who is to say a person earning $2,500 with two aged and sick parents to support is less deserving than someone living alone, earning $1,500?"" he said.
Similarly, while awarding public tenders, officers look at not only price, but also the overall proposal.
This well-calibrated, greater exercise of judgment must permeate throughout government over time, said Mr Ong.
He and other MPs also spoke of the need to reinforce a common national identity, shared by all.
This common identity is drawn from Singapore's diversity, he said, calling on Singaporeans to live together harmoniously.
""As MPs, we knocked on the doors of many HDB units. Just within one block, I stood before homes with Quran verses, crucifixes, joss stick urns, statues of Ganesh fixed around the front doors,"" said Mr Ong.
Security was a top concern among most of the 17 MPs, eight of whom were fresh faces from last September's general election.
If a terror attack happens here, Singaporeans must stand united and not let community relations fracture, said Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Amrin Amin and Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC). The debate resumes today.

","   When founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew died last March, there was sadness across the country. But people did not despair or feel helpless, and investors did not lose confidence in Singapore, said People's Action Party (PAP) chairman Khaw Boon Wan.
He credited the calm response to Mr Lee's ""meticulous planning and effective execution"".
Indeed, it was due to his leadership that ""Singapore crossed a major milestone without any mishap"", Mr Khaw said yesterday, at an event to mark the first anniversary of Mr Lee's death on March 23 last year, at age 91.
The commemorative event, held at the party's headquarters in New Upper Changi Road, was attended by about 250 PAP MPs and party members.
Said Mr Khaw, who is also Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Minister: ""(Mr Lee) did his utmost to build enduring institutions and imbue in the people running them the values of integrity, meritocracy, sound governance and timely succession planning.""
Mr Lee was a founding member of the party and its first secretary-general.
Mr Khaw also unveiled an artillery shell casing from a 21-gun salute for Mr Lee's state funeral, which Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong gave to the party.
Mr Khaw said the gift ""is a permanent reminder to all party members of the ideals which Comrade Lee Kuan Yew brought to the party, and his selfless dedication to improving the lives of Singaporeans"".
He added: ""He showed us the way forward, how to ensure Singapore's relevance to a world (that is) full of surprises and risks. We cannot predict the future, but we can prepare our people so that, come what may, we can always prevail.""
Like Mr Khaw, Mr Ng Kah Ting, who was Punggol MP from 1963 to 1991, said Mr Lee searched hard for new blood to take over the running of the party and Singapore.
""From the 70s onwards, he began to look for younger and newer talent to take over from him and his team,"" said Mr Ng, 76.
Mr Lee handed the reins to Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong in 1990, after 31 years at the helm.
Mr Ng added: ""(Mr Lee) was relentless and uncompromising in his persistent casting of his net for such people... That's the pragmatism and unselfishness of Comrade Lee Kuan Yew. He believed it was his duty to do the correct thing.""
Young PAP member Nicole Leong, 32, who described herself as a member of the generation that received the fruits of the pioneer generation's labour, said: ""Mr Lee and his team strived to overcome many hardships and setbacks so that we could thump our chests and announce to the world that we have arrived.""
The event closed with the crowd reciting the National Pledge and singing the National Anthem. They also sang the emblematic National Day Parade song Home.
Yesterday's event is among a long list of events that individuals and groups will hold in the coming days to remember Mr Lee.

","   A year on, the nation that Lee Kuan Yew forged through sheer force of will continues to thrive. To keep doing so, Singapore will have to be bold and adapt to new challenges, just as he always did.
In the end, Mr Lee Kuan Yew was able to Rest in Peace.
Singapore's founding Prime Minister has not had to make good his pledge that ""even from my sickbed, even if you are going to lower me to the grave and I feel that something is going wrong, I will get up"".
One year to the day he died - March 23, 2015 - Singapore bustles and hums along.
The Republic is home to the world's second-busiest port and lies at the tip of the world's second-busiest waterway. It was ranked the most-connected country in the world, according to the Connected Index rankings compiled by McKinsey Global Institute.
It remains the second most competitive economy in the world. Last year, it attracted 15.2 million tourists. Its dollar trades strongly. It is the world's third-richest country by gross domestic product per capita on a purchasing power parity basis (US$61,567), a measure of a country's wealth divided by its population, which takes into account inflation and living costs for comparison across countries.

What has changed in Singapore one year after Mr Lee Kuan Yew died?And what is his legacy?
A LEADER WHO STOOD WITH US
He was not a leader who stood apart from the people when that Singapore Story got going.
In the end ,some may have been intimidated by his stature perhaps after more than 50 years of being our leader; others who were political oppositionists found that there wasn't going to be enough space for them and Mr Lee Kuan Yew as he would brook nothing from those he deemed to be communists or communalists.
But we would not have come so far ifhe were simply standing on top of a mountain, ordering people around. People identified with him and his dream for the country and were caught up in the vision to build better lives for themselves because he made it seem so possible, in such practical ways, in ways that were close to home for the ordinary Singaporean.

STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS
His (Mr Lee's) avowed policy to centralise and dominate decision-making in all important aspects -political, social, economic- with a strong and efficient political party and Government is our
greatest strength and weakness.
Our resilience as a nation still depends completely on the PAP and the civil
service not stumbling or failing. The PAP and Government must have the confidence to embrace contests of ideas, new blood, and new thinking, internally and eventually externally.
Many countries and systems of government have stood the test of time. Few political parties have. Singapore might be the exception, but I don't want to pin our hopes for Singapore on us always being exceptional in every respect.

BUSINESS AS USUAL
I am quite confident that Singapore will continue to do well in the post-Lee Kuan Yew era .He has laid strong foundations that have served us well. The two prime ministers who succeeded him have ensured that Singapore can thrive without Lee Kuan Yew at the helm, although one must acknowledge that his influence was very much felt right throughout.
Singapore will outlive Lee Kuan Yew, and from what I can see, it is business as usual one year after his death although a grateful nation continues to remember him and his contributions.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY
I came to Singapore from China in October 1998, at the age of 18, to take up a scholarship to study at the National University of Singapore.
After I graduated, I got a job here. I met my wife on campus and we now have a daughter, who is two years plus, and a boy, nine months old. My parents and our home helper take care of the kids.
I decided to apply for citizenship because of my children. My wife and I weren't sure where to go at first. But then we had kids, and you study and research into the school system, and we decided we want our kids to go to primary school here, we want them to fully settle down here. The school system here encourages the learning of the Mother Tongue, the English standard is high, plus the Mathematics and Science are very good, compared to Europe and the United States.
I decided to take up Singapore citizenship this year. When I dropped my China citizenship, I felt a bit lost, but then I got my new passport, and I felt very happy. Oh, and my birthday is on National Day!
I work for a multinational company in a regional role. It is easier for me to travel with a Singapore passport, it is very convenient. My boss can ask me to travel anywhere without giving me a lot of notice, because I won't need a visa, unlike
with a China passport. The first place I am going to with my Singapore passport is Taiwan, for work.
My hope for my daughter? That she can have a happy life as a normal person. My hope for my son is that he can contribute to the nation, to bring Singapore to be come a more innovative and creative place.
I never had a chance to meet Mr Lee Kuan Yew. What would I say to him if I did? I would just say to him: ''Thank you for giving me the opportunity to come from China to Singapore.''

LEE'S LEGACY: A CITY AND ITS PEOPLE
Thousands of Singaporeans are setting time aside this week to remember Mr Lee.
Nur Haziqah, 16, was with schoolmates from Yishun Junior College at an open square in front of the Singapore Management University in Stamford Road, part of a throng of 1,500 Singaporeans of all races, young and old, taking part in a simple ceremony to commemorate the first anniversary of Mr Lee's death. On stage, four youths sang a specially composed song, which has an English chorus and stanzas in Malay, Mandarin and Tamil.
Nur Haziqah, hair neatly brushed away from her face, was sweating in her jacket and tie. A year ago, she had queued 10 hours with her mother to pay respects to Mr Lee. This Sunday morning, March 20, she was taking time out from studies, because ""I want to thank him for all his contributions. Without him, Singapore would not be what it is today"".
Her schoolmate, Mikal Sipanah, 16, nodded. Asked about his hopes for Singapore, he said: ""That we will be sustainable and self-reliant, and not have to depend on others.""
His reply would have cheered Mr Lee, who espoused self-reliance and resilience of a personal, fiscal and political kind.
At a nondescript building in the Bedok heartlands a few days earlier, an Indian man with a bald pate craned his neck to read what others before him had penned on a board for commemorative messages.
Then, because the next available writing space was at waist height, he knelt on one knee, oblivious to the dirt that might streak his white trousers. He penned in blue ink: ""Your legacy, Our Principles to live by.""
Cameras flashed, for this was Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam. The place was the People's Action Party headquarters, and the occasion was the party's own ceremony to remember Mr Lee. A year after his death, the party Mr Lee founded in 1954 has become stronger. Six months ago, it defied historic trends to strengthen its mandate in the September 2015 General Election.
I asked Mr Tharman when he most misses Mr Lee. He pauses, then says that Mr Lee's legacy is everywhere, and that he thinks of Mr Lee even when he walks around his Jurong GRC estate, and sees people of all races and stations of life mingling and interacting.
Indeed, Mr Lee's legacy is Singapore - the city and its people.
He had promised an uncertain population in September 1965, when Singapore was a messy Third World town, that this would become a metropolis in 10 years - ""Never fear!""
Together with an intrepid team of pioneer ministers, he helped secure Singapore's defence and safety; worked to ensure its water sufficiency; and coaxed a bunch of disparate peoples - who spoke different languages, worshipped different deities, and dreamt of going back to different ancestral lands - to put aside the past and become one nation in Singapore. Along the way, he half-coerced, half-cajoled them into improving their social habits.
His legacy is in the institutions that continue to form the bedrock of Singapore's success today: a stable political system that manages to get voters to support a capable, clean government with its eye on the long term; a highly competent and honest civil service; a thriving trade union movement; a grassroots network that reaches into the heartlands.
Mr Lee's legacy lives on, too, in the ease with which people of different races and religions interact in public spaces.
At a ceremony on Sunday organised by the ethnic-based self-help groups, Ms Rhama Sankaran, 58, was delighted to meet someone from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. She wanted to tap their network for a project in Little India to match low-income women with jobs.
Exclaiming at the serendipidity of standing next to a relevant contact, she said: ""Lee Kuan Yew has brought us together!""
As he had in the emotional week of National Mourning when a nation came together.
Those of us who lived through that week will not forget the spontaneous outpouring of gratitude and grief, the snaking queues of people braving rain and heat to wait their turn to pay their respects to Mr Lee at the Parliament House, the sombre, reflective mood that prevailed throughout the island, the sharing of stories.
As historian Tan Tai Yong put it, ""it was a moment, a point in time when we were given the occasion and circumstances to come together to celebrate, mourn and reflect"".
Professor Tan, who is executive vice-president at Yale-NUS College, added: ""We know that surges of patriotism happen in moments of accomplishments or crisis. Can this be sustained in normal circumstances? The signs are positive, but the maintenance of the bond has to be work-in-progress. It cannot be taken as a given.""
ONE YEAR ON
A year is a long time in politics, but history has a longer lens. It will take years, even decades, before an objective, critical look at the titan that was Lee Kuan Yew can be attempted by historians and researchers.
But a year provides a sufficiently satisfactory juncture with which to start to assess Singapore after Lee Kuan Yew.
UniSIM senior lecturer Walter Theseira noted that all countries must examine the past critically to reflect and grow.
And given Mr Lee's own streak of unsentimental hard-headedness, ""no matter how fondly we remember him, I think Mr Lee would have wanted clear-headed thinking more than fuzzy-minded praise"".
A few commentators, asked their views on what aspects of Mr Lee's legacy might prove to be obstacles for the country, zoomed in on the same issue: over-centralised government.
Prof Tan noted that Singapore has a big state that permeates all levels of society. The result is a population that tends to look to the Government for answers.
Prof Tommy Koh added: ""One obstacle is that the people have come to look to the Government to solve all their problems. The second obstacle is a certain arrogance in the attitude of the public sector that the Government knows best. It has become more of an issue now because the world has become more complex, the Government no longer has a monopoly on the knowledge or expertise in every field and we have a better-educated and empowered citizenry.""
In their different ways, these observers point to the same problem in Singapore, when an over-dominant state defined by a strong-willed individual casts a long shadow over the nation, and other sectors (private, non-profit) and individuals don't thrive as well.
That paternalistic instinct in government remains, as does the habit among citizens of looking to the state, fostering a dependent, complaining culture. In this aspect, Singapore remains firmly under the shadow cast by Lee Kuan Yew.
But in many other areas, Singapore has begun to ""grow up"", as he once famously exhorted it to, and strike out on its own. It has done so for the last 26 years, after Mr Lee stepped down as Prime Minister in 1990, and especially after he retired from Cabinet in 2011.
Singapore's iconic skyline today - with the towers and sky deck of Marina Bay Sands - is a visual reminder of how the city has changed in a way its founder could not have imagined. He had declared in 1994 that casinos would be allowed here ""over my dead body"". Never one to fear changing his mind, he eventually came round to the Cabinet's point of view - to allow casinos to set up shop in Singapore as part of ""integrated resorts"" and to have Singapore host Formula 1 races - to boost the convention business and tourism. Once he had decided, he was vocal in defence of the policy.
In social policy, the country has moved beyond Lee Kuan Yew in many ways. Competitive meritocracy has been tempered by compassion and a broader definition of merit, with policies that recognise non-academic achievement in schools, for example.
In the years since Mr Lee left Cabinet, the Government has loosened its purse strings, with a growing array of subsidies and grants - not just for the very sick, the very old or the very poor who were the only ones permitted to get welfare payments in Mr Lee's Singapore.
Workers get wage top-ups, while their employers get wage subsidies to co-fund pay increases and to supplement wages for the elderly and the low-income. The average middle-income family gets subsidised healthcare, eldercare and childcare.
Last year, Singapore introduced universal health coverage via its MediShield Life plan - decades after Mr Lee shot down his deputy PM and erstwhile Health Minister Toh Chin Chye's appeal for a universal healthcare system.
And last year, the Government decided to give a monthly allowance to low-income elderly folks, in effect a pension payout which would once have been dismissed as unwise and unsound.
Taken together, the changes have softened the ""every man for himself"" capitalist ethos of Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore, where one works hard to fend for oneself (and one's immediate family), and the risks of financial difficulty brought by illness, old age or unemployment are borne by the individual.
Instead, there is more sharing of risks with the community, and the state. Ironically, in so doing, Singapore can be said to be coming full circle, returning to the socialist roots of its pioneers. Mr Lee after all began political life as a Fabian socialist, but changed his views after a few years in government.
He used to say in his later years that he was no longer in charge, and was a tad out of touch, and directed questions on policies, or Singapore's future, to the current crop of ministers.
In life and after death, Mr Lee casts a very big shadow. A lot of the shade provided is welcome. For example, the institutions built, the values of integrity, incorruptibility, meritocracy, multiracialism, fiscal discipline, provide space within which Singapore can grow deeper roots and thrive.
SHADY CANOPY
The question for Singapore in the future is whether it can emerge from the protective shade of Lee Kuan Yew to come into its own, much like a youth having to find his own way in the world.
A few people told me they think the post-LKY period began a few years ago, after he was past his political prime, and that Singapore already feels the impact of this.
In diplomatic circles, the feeling is that access to big powers' leaders is harder. Singapore punched above its weight in part because of the status and personality of Lee Kuan Yew. Robbed of that star appeal, leaders and diplomats will have to work harder to make Singapore relevant.
Within the public sector, a crop of high-profile corruption cases in recent years is cause for concern. It has taken 50 years for intolerance of corruption to be transplanted into Singapore, but it can be uprooted within a generation. Singapore fell from least corrupt nation in the world in 2010, to eighth in 2015, according to the Corruption Perceptions Index reported by Transparency International. Its average rank was 5.24 from 1995 until 2015.
Today, a more assertive citizenry does not hesitate to excoriate the authorities when public services do not measure up to their expectations, such as over-frequent train disruptions or hospital lapses. Then the questions inevitably arise: Is Singapore beginning to slide into performance mediocrity, condoning sloppiness? What would Lee Kuan Yew have done?
Ironically, however, another segment of Singapore society would clearly like the country to go beyond thinking about what Mr Lee would have done.
After all, new circumstances call for fresh thinking and bold answers to both novel challenges and even recurring questions. Just as Mr Lee was never wedded to an idea or ideology, he would surely not want his solutions to the problems of his times codified into a system of thought to be unthinkingly applied to a different era. Singapore, he might continue to assert, should just do what works, and get on with it.
One year on, Singapore stands tall as a testament to the success of Lee Kuan Yew's life's work as the leader of this nation. Future generations will benefit from the shade provided by his values, ideas and institutions.
But to truly become great in the future, the Republic and its people will have to go beyond and do what Mr Lee and his pioneering team did - be bold and blaze a new trail.

","   Fort Canning Park is historically significant, which is why the People's Action Party (PAP) Seniors' Group prefers the location for the Founders' Memorial.
Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob, in her capacity as chairman of the ruling party's seniors' wing, said she hoped the memorial will remind people about the values that underpinned Singapore's founding.
And Fort Canning has played an important role so ""we want to remember what it stands for, what it means to our country, and how it has contributed to our history"".
The PAP Seniors' Group had recommended last September that the memorial to honour Singapore's founding leaders be built at the park. It cited how it was previously a seat of political power.
In the 14th century, Singapore's former rulers had palaces on the hill there, and Sir Stamford Raffles built his first residence there soon after arriving in Singapore in 1819.
""There may be some access challenges, but if it's doable, that's one area that the Government should seriously consider,"" said Madam Halimah in response to questions from reporters.
A fortnight ago, the committee tasked with conceptualising the memorial made its recommendations to the Government, and indicated that while both sites had their merits, it preferred Bay East Garden at Gardens by the Bay over Fort Canning Park. The two sites had been identified in consultation with the Urban Redevelopment Authority.
Speaking to reporters following a brisk walk at Bay East Garden to mark the first anniversary of founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's death, Madam Halimah said the Founders' Memorial is a ""very useful project"" to remind Singaporeans of the values that Mr Lee stood for, such as multiracialism, meritocracy, self-reliance and inclusivity.
Mr Lee died on March 23 last year, aged 91.
""To me, his greatest legacy is infusing in us a sense of pride: pride in being Singaporean,"" she said.
She added that while there have been numerous events marking the one-year anniversary, the point was not to glorify Mr Lee but to instead remind Singaporeans, especially the young, of how far the nation has come.
""It's not to glorify Mr Lee... but it's a great reminder to Singaporeans of how far we have come, but that our job is not done,"" she said. ""We have to continue with the good work that Mr Lee and his generation of leaders have done, for another 50 years, or another one hundred years.""
Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said at a separate remembrance event in Marine Parade that Mr Lee would have wanted Singaporeans to reflect on the values he stood for and to look to the future, instead of celebrating his death anniversary in a big way every year.
He also said, when asked by reporters, that he agreed with Mr Lee's daughter, Dr Lee Wei Ling, who said in a Facebook post on Friday that Mr Lee would not have wanted the anniversary to be an occasion for ""hero worship"".
Mr Goh also cited a commentary by Straits Times editor-at-large Han Fook Kwang on Sunday on what Mr Lee had to say about Singapore's future, saying: ""Mr Lee was always focused on the future, and he would want life to carry on normally, and in fact, you know, for life to be even better after him.
""So that's the best way to remember him: build on Singapore.""

","   Youth must think of what they can do for nation, and not just ask what S'pore has to offer them: Chan Chun Sing
Whether Singapore makes it to SG100 will depend on whether citizens feel they have a sense of national identity as one people and a shared obligation to help one another, in particular the less well-off, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing said yesterday.
And the youth should not just ask what the country can offer to help them, but what they can do to make it better, he told over 200 young people at a dialogue on a visit to Geylang Serai ward in Marine Parade GRC.
Mr Chan cautioned against going the way of other countries that are well endowed, but that are divided and see fights over resources.
Participants submitted questions through their smartphones and voted on those they wanted him to respond to. The top issue: Why should the youth want to stay in Singapore till SG100 when the cost of living is high, prompting many to think hard about settling down.
Mr Chan, who is labour chief and deputy chairman of the People's Association, said most Singaporeans at independence in 1965 were committed to the country ""even when the chips are down"". They did not adopt a ""transactional"" national identity that hinges purely on the benefits of citizenship.
""Is your staying in Singapore conditional on certain factors, particularly material or otherwise?"" he asked the participants. ""How many of you will still stay here if, for the next 10 years, we have a serious recession and you cannot fulfil your aspirations, find the jobs you like?
""Your answer to that question will decide whether we have an SG100,"" he said. The ""1965 generation"" stayed put in spite of uncertainties and worked to create a nation, he said.""If enough of us stay here 'in spite of', then don't worry about SG100 - even SG1000, we will be here,"" he added. ""But if the majority of us are here only because of what the country can give us, then we will be in a very different position.""
Mr Chan also said how cohesive Singapore stays depends on whether people think in terms of getting maximum benefit from the state, or if they can accept there are others who need more help. He cited an example from his Meet-the-People Session where, at one table, an elderly man earning $1,000 a month had asked for ComCare aid. At the next, a newly-wed couple in their 20s were angry they did not qualify for additional housing grants as their combined monthly income was $12,000.
He said: ""We don't want to end up in a situation like some other places where, even when you have resources to share, people fight over them.""
Mr Chan noted that Singaporean identity was not defined through markers like race, language or religion, but through ideals like meritocracy and multiracialism.
Republic Polytechnic student Lim Yi Xuan, 18, said the dialogue made her realise there are no easy answers to some tough questions facing Singapore: ""It made me realise that distributing aid equally may not be the most equitable way.""
Raffles Institution student Muzammil Arif Jabbar, 17, said Mr Chan's comments were a reminder that the youth had to take an interest in issues affecting Singapore and do their part to ensure it survives.
Mr Chan's visit is part of a series of monthly visits to constituencies by younger ministers, and the first since last year's general election.
He also spoke to residents at Haig Road Food Centre and met community leaders at Khadijah Mosque for a closed-door dialogue.
""It's good for our youth to think about the kind of challenges we will be facing - and how each and every one of us can chip in to play a role towards SG100,"" he told reporters.
""If you look at the energy that our youth are displaying, you can be very confident that we will be able to face the future with confidence.""

","   To boost productivity in construction, a HDB subsidiary can buy and lease labour-saving equipment to smaller companies. GLCs can partner SMEs as preferred partners to go overseas. The $4.5 billion Industry Transformation Programme announced in this year's Budget has to offer targeted measures to boost specific sectors.
Studying industrial productivity is like observing babies - they all look the same from afar but, close up, each is different. While broad measures like birth weights and size vary little, it's the small differences which matter the most - for your own baby as for your business.
By the same token, statistical indices, whether for productivity or for demography, tell only a crude and very general story: the broad themes but not the critical sub-plots. Generalities disguise the unique differentiations underlying each industrial sector's productivity challenges.
Like the proverbial shotgun where a sharpshooter's rifle is needed, government attempts to increase economic productivity must move beyond broad initiatives such as the Productivity and Innovation Credit scheme which any enterprise can take advantage of, to highly targeted measures appropriate to the different needs of each industry sector.
Singapore's economy today is far more complex than when I joined our family business 30 years ago - much less Singapore at its founding. Blunt instruments of monetary and fiscal measures can affect the environment within which companies function, but meaningful and complete economic transformation must be primarily sector-focused, in recognition of the complex differences between each sector.
This is precisely what the $4.5 billion Industry Transformation Programme, announced in this year's Budget, seeks to do. If it succeeds with each of the 20 sectors - and probably more sub-sectors - for which individual road maps will be created, Singapore will truly be transformed for the next 50 years.LEGACY OF A DUAL ECONOMY
The current productivity conundrum in Singapore has been long in the making. It is the unfortunate product of a dual economy which has existed since our founding.
On the one hand, the large, MNC-led export-oriented economy had to be, from the outset, globally competitive to simply survive. Therefore, productivity-upgrading efforts, such as during the mid-1980s, were focused on this sector.
In contrast, the domestically oriented economy could afford to be globally non-competitive - ergo the continuing dependence on cheap foreign workers with low labour productivity.
I have written on this subject in the past, arguing that the smaller domestic economy, such as construction, retail and hospitality, and other services which are location-bound by their nature, for many decades suffered (or enjoyed, depending on one's perspective) from a benign and even possibly semi-intentional neglect. A low-cost domestic environment certainly made Singapore more attractive as an export platform.REINVENTING THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR
This dichotomy between a high-cost, high-productivity export economy and a low-cost, low-skilled and low-productivity domestic economy continued to grow over time. I remember this first-hand: I sold off a family-owned construction company in the mid-1980s in expectation of labour-restricting, productivity-increasing measures being introduced in the construction industry, which would be painful but ultimately beneficial ( I didn't want to wait ).
But the crunch never came. Today, productivity in the Singapore construction industry remains closer to Third World standards than to the First World economy we have become. The same is true for other labour-intensive, domestic-focused service industries; their productivity at best approaches Second World standards.
The problem is that productivity growth is not only very slow, but also very difficult to achieve, but for quasi-political reasons - Singaporeans' antipathy towards too many foreign workers in their midst - this transition is being pushed at an extremely painful pace for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It needs to be done, but for the domestic-oriented SMEs, special attention must be given to their needs.
For example, upgrading the construction industry will require a lot of coordinated work beyond just turning off the tap of cheap, unskilled foreign workers and giving accelerated tax allowances for buying labour-reducing machinery, or credits for skills upgrading.
Because of the continuing shortage of skilled Singaporeans willing to work in this industry, a policy of encouraging the influx of one highly skilled foreign worker - at supervisory level, for example - to replace two (or three) unskilled foreigners - may be more appropriate here than simply cutting off the supply suddenly.
Another industry-specific measure which would really help the construction industry upgrade is the creation of a government- owned company which would own myriad labour-saving equipment and employ a pool of foreign, highly skilled specialists and supervisors; the company would rent out equipment and hire out its skilled supervisory staff at subsidised rates to companies when they win a construction contract. This makes upgrading less painful for companies which simply cannot afford to compete for contracts while burdened with increasingly expensive overheads.
For the entire sector to increase productivity, building materials technology, particularly via pre-fabrication of entire modules such as bathrooms and kitchens, will play a critical role. But no private company will invest in such facilities with a small domestic market such as Singapore's. This is where a Housing Board subsidiary could invest in such facilities and supply to both the private and public housing developers and contractors - in any size, shape or quality of finishes but entirely pre-fabricated.
In its early years, the Government invested in a trading company Intraco and steel plant NatSteel as strategically important businesses. Singapore today needs similar companies to service the entire property development and construction industry.SMEs OF THE FUTURE
Household services are a totally different matter. To encourage women to work, households were allowed to quite easily hire foreign domestic helpers. In order to maintain our relatively high female labour force participation rate, the Government has not tightened the screws on the influx of foreign maids as it has for foreign construction workers.
In the future, however, even this still-liberal policy has to inevitably change, so a future-ready approach would be to encourage the emergence of millennial entrepreneurs in online-enabled household services, ranging from grocery shopping to high-productivity house-cleaning or meal-supplying services.
These are SMEs of the future, to be undertaken by tomorrow's entrepreneur-wannabes, such as our new graduates. Construction companies are SMEs of the past, to be brought from Third to First World standards. Both are so different that measures to help them need to be individually crafted.
Even within the same sector are sub-sectors whose needs are different. The food and beverage business is a case in point. Helping traditional hawkers who sell food in hawker centres to be more productive requires different measures from, for example, cajoling hotels to share their banquet and catering staff with one another, or nurturing a scalable fast-food enterprise to become international. And the list goes on.
The term PPP usually refers to public-private-partnerships in large-scale infrastructural investments. But PPP can also be the core concept behind the Industry Transformation Programme, where sectoral road maps will be created and executed through a partnership including industry associations and government agencies.NEW KIND OF P-TO-P PARTNERSHIP
While productivity enhancement and access to foreign labour are two important issues, other imperatives in the transformational journey will be internationalisation and technological upgrading.
Another P-to-P is not Public-Private but Private-to-Private, that is, inter-company collaboration. Should Singapore companies cooperate more actively - as they seem to be elsewhere in Asia - in order to be more competitive, particularly in overseas markets?
The obvious answer is yes, but genuine industry collaboration is easier said than done. In countries which are vaunted for this, often the reality is one of oligopolistic practices quietly sanctioned by political cronies. The zaibatsus of Japan and chaebols of Korea, for example, with near-mythical business prowess, have now been largely discredited as cartels which collaborated to prevent outsiders from gatecrashing their cosy arrangements.
Hong Kong property tycoons collaborate often in property deals, but also in a near-cartel situation of risk-spreading - and property joint ventures by their nature are easy to collaborate on because of their quick mutual exits.
The landscape of Singapore- owned enterprises largely comprises the ultra-large TLCs (Temasek-linked companies) and GLCs (government-linked companies) on the one hand, and the truly private-sector SMEs on the other hand.
The TLCs/GLCs have successfully penetrated overseas markets in ventures as varied as retail mall investments, offshore fabrication services, or industrial park development - to mention just a few.
It is quite feasible to craft a P-P collaboration, Singapore-style. Without violating principles of transparency and meritocracy, or World Trade Organisation rules of equal access, these TLCs/GLCs can create a system where they have a periodically refreshed list of Singapore SMEs selected through an open and transparent process as their ""preferred partners"" in overseas projects, whether it be in logistics or consultancies, retail shops or other kinds of service or product providers.
This ""preference"" would be expressed, for example, as additional evaluation points or percentage in pricing (depending on the case) in any tender process called by the GLC/TLC and which would probably also include companies from that overseas country.
A one-size-fits-all approach to industry transformation can have unintentionally contradictory results. In supply-chain and logistical services, for example, the application of more sophisticated computer technologies can dramatically increase efficiencies and productivity.
In the banking world, however, advances in financial technologies - now called ""fintech"" - are likely to render entire echelons of highly skilled and paid analysts and brokers redundant. Each industry has its own challenges and solutions, and it will be the task of each player in the partnership to devise workable solutions.
Pathways to success in SG100, whether in education, careers or business, will be variegated, intersecting and, above all, with road maps drawn up by the drivers as well as the road-planners.

","   There will always be a fine balance between the civil service being neutral and non-political, and being politically sensitive and responsive, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday.
Singapore must continue to maintain this balance - even as it remains crucial that the political leadership and civil service share the same beliefs, values and ideals.
Speaking at the annual Administrative Service promotion ceremony and dinner at Shangri-La Hotel, Mr Lee set out the different roles of elected politicians and non-partisan civil servants.
Ministers look after politics: getting a sense of the ground, deciding the national direction, selling policies to the public and making them work. But a minister must also be hands-on in his ministry, articulating a clear strategy and making sure civil servants implement policies well. ""He has to provide political guidance to the civil servants to deliver results,"" said Mr Lee.
At the same time, he must also protect civil servants from political interference and not involve them in political activities.
As for civil servants, their responsibility is policy - translating political goals into workable plans.
PM LEE ON.....
THE LINE BETWEEN POLICY AND POLITICS
In Singapore, we often think of policies as the real purpose of governance, while politics is merely the sometimes messy means of choosing a government. Ministers live in the land of politics, civil servants in the land of policies. And when you cross the border, there is a rigorous checkpoint, you are frisked, as you enter a different country. But government is not so clear-cut and simple because life is not so clear-cut and simple. Policy and politics cannot be separated so neatly.
THE ROLES OF MINISTERS AND CIVIL SERVANTS
The ministers look after the politics, sense the ground, decide the direction the country should take, sell the policies to the public, make them work.
At the same time, the minister must also master his ministry, and the policies he is responsible for. He is not a non-executive chairman, presiding passively over an organisation that runs fine without him, while he busies himself with politics.
He has to be hands on - articulate a clear strategy for his ministry to achieve the needs and aspirations of the people, make sure the permanent secretary does a good job in implementing policy and operating the ministry.
He has to provide political guidance to the civil servants to deliver results. At the same time, he must protect civil servants from political interference, and he must not involve them in political activities.
On the civil service side, your primary responsibility is policy. You must be equipped and able to translate political goals into workable policies... The civil service is not independent of the elected government, unlike the judiciary, which is a different branch of government. Under our system of government, the civil service must serve the elected government of the day.
The civil service must therefore understand the political context, and the thinking of the political leadership, so that it will not come up with policies and ideas that are non-starters, so it can design policies that are not only sound, but are well-supported and can be well implemented.
Civil servants have to be politically impartial: they should not be campaigning for or against a political party. They must not misuse state resources or powers for partisan political purposes.
But neither can they shy away from carrying out their duties without fear or favour when a matter could be politically controversial. For these reasons, that is why key officers in the service are not allowed to be members of political parties.
The civil service is not independent of the elected government, unlike the judiciary, Mr Lee said.
And under Singapore's system, the civil service must serve the government of the day. ""The civil service must therefore understand the political context and the thinking of the political leadership.""
This is so it can design policies that are not only sound, but which will also have the people's support and can be implemented well.
Yet civil servants must be politically impartial: They must not campaign for or against any party, nor misuse state resources or powers for partisan purposes.
Nor should they shy away from carrying out their duties when a matter is politically controversial.
Despite their distinctive roles, Mr Lee said, the political leadership and civil service must still share the same major beliefs, values and ideals. These values include meritocracy, clean government, multiracialism, inclusive development and economic growth. And the beliefs include that no one owes Singapore a living and the country must be exceptional to thrive.
In Singapore's founding years, political leaders and civil servants were ""cut from the same cloth"", said Mr Lee. So it is not surprising that some civil servants became ministers and civil servants were ""talent-spotted"" to join politics.
""For that was a generation when politics was on hold,"" he added.
The People's Action Party (PAP) had total dominance, holding every parliamentary seat for 15 years.
Had people not put party politics aside, ""we might well have ended up with no country, at least not one we would be proud to call home"".
But Singapore is in a different phase today, said Mr Lee. The post-independence generation, born into growth and prosperity, has more diverse experiences and interests and wants to be heard.
""Politics is no longer dormant,"" he added. The PAP is still in a strong position, but the opposition ""has more fertile ground to till"" and is constantly active, with elections fiercely contested.
""The political leadership and the civil service have to work hand-in- hand in this new environment, with each understanding its respective role,"" he concluded.
At last night's dinner, 65 administrative officers were promoted. Nine of them were among the 21 newly appointed officers.
In his speech,civil service head Peter Ong laid out three ways to develop strong public service leaders: Building a diverse leadership corps, forging deeper partnerships with stakeholders, and envisioning the future together.
The public service has launched an exercise akin to the SGFuture dialogue series. Called ""PSfuture"", agencies will hold sessions to gather officers' views and aspirations.3 countries, 3 different ways
PM Lee yesterday cited three instances of how political leaders and civil servants work together in other societies - the United States, Britain and modern China.
Singapore's system is British in form, with elected political leaders supported by a non-partisan civil service, he noted. But it has worked quite well because both politicians and civil servants share the same core values.
UNITED STATES
At the federal level, there are not one but at least four layers of political appointees. The president is elected, and appoints not just the secretaries, but deputy secretaries, assistant secretaries and deputy assistant secretaries.
When a new president is elected, and a new administration takes over, 8,000 public officers leave, and 8,000 new appointees come in.
It doesn't always work well, as departments are so large and entrenched that it is hard for a president and his appointees to impose their will on the bureaucracy. Sometimes, whole departments are sidelined or given prominence.
BRITAIN
The British have the classic traditional model - an impartial civil service serving whoever is the elected government of the day. For much of the 20th century, this was workable, because whichever party was in power, they shared the same basic assumptions. But in recent decades, this has not been the case and the system has not worked so well.
Successive British governments introduced political advisers in the Cabinet Office, the Prime Minister's Office and key ministries, whom the PM and his senior colleagues could rely upon to develop and implement their political goals, and help them get re-elected.
The need for gear meshing between the ministers and the civil service has increased. Britain now has almost 100 special advisers.
CHINA
Politics is in command. The Communist Party permeates the whole government. It goes all the way down to the village, the factory floor, the military unit. At every level, the party secretary calls the shots. The government leader is only second-in-command.
At the pinnacle, there is the general secretary of the party. The key decisions are made in party committees, rather than in the apparatus of the State Council.

","   This week, I am hosting 20 of the most senior public servants from developing countries all around the world. These officials, from places as varied as Cameroon, Cambodia and the Cook Islands, are gathering at the UNDP Global Centre for Public Service Excellence (GCPSE) here in Singapore to consider how best to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
This is a week-long programme on Transformational Leadership for Delivering the 2030 Agenda: Learning from Singapore's Success, run jointly by the GCPSE and the Singapore Cooperation Programme of the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The 17 SDGs were agreed on at the United Nations last year as the replacement for the far less ambitious Millennium Development Goals. The goals cover everything from poverty to hunger, natural resources, climate change, prosperity, fulfilment, peace and partnerships.
When my visitors look up at the city's startlingly glitzy skyline and wonder how that sprung from the chaotic, smelly harbour of 50 years ago, what can they learn from the Singapore Story of sustainable success that will be relevant?
The story of Singapore's developmental success has been articulated many times, from varied perspectives. Most commentators focus on three decisive factors: meritocracy in recruitment and promotion for all government jobs, zero tolerance of corruption and enlightened leadership. All agree that core to Singapore's astonishing speed of progress was an honest, committed public service.
However, when Singapore began its modern developmental journey as a brand-new nation in 1965, the world was a less complex place. Citizens today are more educated, increasingly globalised in outlook, and better networked with counterparts in other countries than ever before. Technology is pervasive to a degree that few could have imagined in the 1960s. Predicting the future is, oddly enough, becoming harder. The realm of ""unknown unknowns"" is probably growing, and certainly more significant today than it was 50 years ago. The natural environment also seems more unstable; the scope and scale of natural calamities of the last few years are unprecedented. Developing nations today face a more complex environment than Singapore and other now- developed countries did when they were undergoing the transformation.
Nonetheless, Singapore's astonishing achievements remain a beacon of hope and inspiration for nations still struggling with their own developmental trajectories. Singapore in its early days benefited from two decisive factors: the quality of its political leaders, and of its public service. The political leadership was visionary and focused on nation-building. The public service was efficient, corruption within its ranks was ruthlessly and decisively stamped out, and its officers wholeheartedly embraced the nation-building ambition. This effective ""political/administrative leadership interface"" was the superstructure upon which the economy, healthcare, education and other components for transformational development could be supported. In short, both political leadership and the civil service were imbued with an intrinsic sense of public service motivation. This was an attribute lacking in many other developing countries at that time, and unfortunately still to this day.
Why is this attribute even more important now than half a century ago? The international community, in adopting Resolution 60/34 of the United Nations General Assembly on Public Administration and Development of 2006, agreed that ""an efficient, accountable, effective and transparent public administration is a key driver of social and economic development and has a key role to play in the implementation of internationally agreed goals"".
Yet research suggests that the public's trust in government is in sharp decline in many parts of the world (for example, De Vries and Kim, 2014; Newland, 2015: 39-63). This applies even though government performance has improved on many fronts. This low trust in government undermines quasi-voluntary tax compliance, diminishes the willingness to pay for public services, and decreases morale of officials.
Besides increasing complexity, governments today also confront significant new pressures on public service. While citizens demand better services and want to participate in policymaking, they are not content just to be presented with efficient service. Public officials are frequently being told to be more ""people-centred"" and ""entrepreneurial"", meaning that risk aversion should be replaced by greater tolerance of risk. It is far from clear whether the bitterly partisan politics that exists in many countries really can embrace that change. Yet governments will have to adapt and respond dynamically to situations that change more often and more rapidly.
Research also suggests that trust in government and state legitimacy are not primarily created by democracy, the rule of law, or efficiency and effectiveness, but are the outcomes of ""the impartiality of institutions that exercise government authority"". And ""one of the most interesting findings from the research on happiness is how much the quality of government and the trust and confidence people have in their public officials contribute to well-being"" (Derek Bok's The Politics Of Happiness). So the reason people are increasingly losing confidence in their governments seems to be that almost everywhere we confront a steadily widening gap between reality and rhetoric, between hard fact and fiction, in public life. (Hood and Dixon 2015:12).
Where to start on reversing this?
PRIDE, PRESTIGE, PURPOSE AND THE POLITICS OF PRACTICAL PRAGMATISM
Less well understood in the story of Singapore's developmental success was the importance of creating a strong intrinsic motivation. This can be summed up as its ability to instil Pride in working in the public sector, maintain the Prestige of posts in public service, and imbue a strong sense of Purpose in public officials. Along with this came what I call the Politics of Practical Pragmatism. Senior officials understood and embraced the reality that Politics was a fact of life that needed to be managed rather than avoided, developing an approach to problem-solving that was not ideological but Practical and Pragmatic. It is apparent that the formula worked.
In facing the development challenges of the 21st century, the public service and political leaders in developing countries of today need to have the same intrinsic public service passion as their counterparts did in the Singapore of the 1960s.

"," Presidential elections; Affirmative action; Public hearings
","   Minority representation emerged as the main topic among the 19 people and groups who addressed the Constitutional Commission. They were invited to speak after submitting their views in a public consultation. Submissions came from a broad section, including a number of young people. The commission expects to submit its recommendations later this year, before the next presidential election, which must be held by August 2017.
At all four public hearings by the Constitutional Commission that is reviewing aspects of the elected presidency, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon repeatedly asked one question.
Phrased in different ways but no less pointed each time, its essence was: Is it all right for there not to be a minority president for a very long time?
CJ Menon, who chairs the commission, directed this question, more than once, to law experts, academics and law students who were discussing how to ensure minorities are represented in the office of the President.
Minority-race representation is one of the three areas being reviewed by the Constitutional Commission, and the topic most hotly discussed at the four public hearings.
Consensus was rare and there were no easy answers. While most speakers broadly agreed on the need for minorities to be represented, they were deeply divided on how to achieve it.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
I think the very fact that we're looking for some special way in which minorities can be represented or can become president already is an admission that we need to have something special. ''
FORMER CABINET MINISTER S. DHANABALAN
Some preferred a system where certain elections were reserved for candidates of specified races, while others preferred candidates to run in multiracial teams.
But many were disturbed by what they saw as a form of affirmative action, although others accepted it as a necessary price to pay.
Two broad categories of proposals on how to ensure minority representation emerged.
The first was to occasionally restrict presidential polls to minority candidates, while the second was to have presidential candidates run in teams, with at least one candidate per team being of a minority race.
The Sunday Times examines the merits and downsides to the proposals raised at the hearings, as well as the concerns raised then.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION OR NOT?
The fact is that Singapore has not had a Malay president - or even a Malay candidate for president - since the elected presidency was set up in 1991. Its only Malay president, the late Mr Yusof Ishak, was appointed to the office after Independence.
Singapore, from 1999 to 2011, had an Indian president, Mr S R Nathan, who was elected unopposed in 1999 and 2005.
In 2011, all four candidates in the presidential election were Chinese.
The relative scarcity of presidents and candidates from minority communities is a problem, agreed most.
Referring to how portraits of Singapore's president are displayed in public buildings, Institute of Policy Studies senior research fellow Mathew Mathews told one of the hearings: ""If you grow up and all these pictures on the wall are not your ethnic group, there is a perception that people who look like me will never be there.""
That is not a good position for Singapore to be in, he added.
Arguing for the necessity of an institutional fix, Dr Mathews said that society is not race-blind, although that might change in time.
He cited an IPS survey he helmed in 2013, which showed that about 18 per cent of the 2,000 Chinese respondents said they were not comfortable with a Malay or Indian boss.
This was in contrast to about 7 per cent of Chinese respondents who were not comfortable with a Malay or Indian colleague.
This suggested that Singaporeans are not race-blind, a pattern mirrored in the findings of a 2007 Nanyang Technological University report that in the political sphere, Indians were consistently preferred over Malays for the positions of MP, Prime Minister and President.
But several individuals at the hearings were adamant that tweaking the elected presidency was not the solution, arguing that doing so was tantamount to affirmative action.
This went against the principle of meritocracy, as much a pillar of Singapore as multiracialism, they said.
Moreover, giving minority candidates a boost risked undermining those who get into office that way.
IPS deputy director of research Gillian Koh explained: ""The moment you institute this, you are saying certain communities cannot make it and they require certain help.""
The winner of an election reserved for a minority community might be regarded as a token representative and lack gravitas and political legitimacy, she and IPS research assistant Tan Min-Wei added.
But Dr Mathews disagreed, arguing that an individual could prove these perceptions wrong once in office, if he performed well.
Weighing in on the concerns, former Cabinet minister S. Dhanabalan said that any change to the elected presidency to ensure minority representation would necessarily involve affirmative action of some sort.
""I think the very fact that we're looking for some special way in which minorities can be represented or can become president already is an admission that we need to have something special,"" he said.
A CASE FOR CLOSED ELECTIONS
The first category of proposals raised the idea of closed, or reserved, elections.
Under this system, if there has been no president from a particular minority group for a number of terms, the next election will be reserved for candidates of that group.
This was the broad idea behind Dr Mathews' proposal, and an element of Mr Dhanabalan's as well.
A key feature of this system is that it would have ""a natural sunset"", said CJ Menon, noting that the provision for a closed election would not be invoked if a minority president is elected in an open election.
""If society develops along certain lines (and) we become less and less aware of race, then you won't need to invoke the provision,"" he said.
The advantage, posited CJ Menon, was that such a system allowed Singapore to continue striving to become race-neutral, while ensuring that the races would be represented at least periodically in the office.
""You allow the system to wind its way towards a situation where the goal, at the end of the day, is race neutrality,"" said CJ Menon, wondering aloud if it was the ""least obtrusive"" way of doing so.
Seen in this light, having a closed election as a last resort would function as a failsafe or ""safeguard"", as Dr Mathews put it.
Some objected to the idea of ringfencing voters' choice this way.
Political science academic Loke Hoe Yeong said that if the Government designates that an office be contested only by candidates of a certain ethnicity, ""it could be perceived as being very undemocratic"".
Human rights group Maruah said in its submission that introducing racial criteria for the presidency runs against the principle of treating all Singaporeans equally ""regardless of race, language or religion"", as laid out in the National Pledge.
JOINT TICKET SYSTEM
Others preferred instead a Group Representation Constituency (GRC)-style process for the presidential elections, where two or three members - with at least one minority member - run for the office as a team.
The winning candidates could rotate the seat of President between themselves, with their teammates serving as vice-president or on the Council of Presidential Advisers in between.
Such a joint ticket system was proposed by Mr Dhanabalan, who suggested two-man teams for every third presidential election, and by others including Eurasian Association president Benett Theseira.
One advantage is that Singaporeans are already familiar with the GRC system, albeit for parliamentary elections.
But Professor Chan Heng Chee, a member of the commission, asked whether this system would leave a minority candidate open to the criticism that he was there on the coat-tails of the majority candidate.
Mr Dhanabalan replied that any GRC arrangement could not escape such criticisms, but thought that closed elections went too far.
A QUESTION OF PALATABILITY
Which proposal the commission decides to recommend could come down to a question of palatability, and Singapore might even see a mix of elements of both.
Members of the commission noted that both proposals could be seen as restricted elections in essence, with CJ Menon remarking: ""It's really a question of palatability, isn't it? Because in substance, it comes down to the same thing.""
But if that is the case, the sunset clause system seems more appealing. For one thing, it acknowledges the importance of representation in the office of the presidency.
It also avoids any possible upheaval that might result from having a rotating team of presidents with terms shorter than the standard six years, as would be the case for a GRC-style system.
Most importantly, it would be a failsafe instead of a normal state of affairs.
The irony of such a system would be that it would be created with the hope that it would never have to be used. And if the clause never kicked in, that would be a success.

","   The Singapore 20 years from now will be an innovative and deeply inclusive one, where a new generation of Singaporeans define their own purpose in life, each with a sense of individuality, in a society that is bound together and at home with itself, said Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam yesterday.
Painting a picture of what the Republic will be like in 2035, based on a poll of students, he said: ""Twenty years from now, we will still be a little red dot, always will be.
""But it will be a deep red dot. The colour of the Singapore heart.""
Education, he said, would become more holistic, flexible and encouraging.
A more flexible system and a focus on skills and job performance, rather than qualifications earned early in life, will be needed instead for the fluid job market of the future, noted Mr Tharman, who is also Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies. He was speaking at the opening ceremony of the Pre-University Seminar held at the Nanyang Technological University.
While there is a ""real fear"" in many advanced countries that the jobs lost will outstrip the jobs created, Singapore can avoid that by responding in advance to what is coming, said Mr Tharman. Studies show it is more productive for humans to ""cobot"" - collaborate with robots - than to have enterprises that rely purely on humans or robots alone.
About 550 students from 30 pre-university institutions, including junior colleges and polytechnics, attended the event, whose theme this year is ""Living the Singapore Spirit"". It is co-organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Hwa Chong Institution.
Citing an informal survey MOE did to find out the aspirations of seminar participants, Mr Tharman noted that students ranked job satisfaction and the ability to make the most of one's talents, above factors like pay and career progress. Most also felt the Singapore of the future has to be innovative and inclusive.
Whether or not these aspirations could be met would depend on how Singapore reacts to changes in areas such as technology and geopolitics, said Mr Tharman.
Some jobs - such as software engineers, data scientists and healthcare professionals - could be in demand, while demand for lawyers, accountants and real estate or insurance agents could taper off.
While there is a ""real fear"" in many advanced countries that the jobs lost will outstrip the jobs created, Singapore can avoid that by responding in advance to what is coming, said Mr Tharman. Studies show it is more productive for humans to ""cobot"" - collaborate with robots - than to have enterprises that rely purely on humans or robots alone.
Education will also evolve, with a premium on original thinking, which breeds the innovative spirit.
The way students and parents go about selecting schools will change, he said, with people valuing schools that develop their interests rather than schools with the highest cut-off scores.
But there is a ""deeper tension"" between innovation and inclusiveness, said Mr Tharman. While young Singaporeans will have a stronger sense of individuality, Singapore must not become an individualistic society but maintain a ""spirit of solidarity"" with ""diversity of thinking"" .
""It is a tension, but how this plays out depends on us,"" said Mr Tharman, who also fielded questions from students on issues such as meritocracy, media freedom and cultural preservation. The Pre-University Seminar, which has been held yearly since 1970, ends on Thursday.

","   On June 4, Hong Lim Park played host to the Pink Dot rally, an annual event to support the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.
A few days after the event, on June 7, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued a statement that said: ""The Government's general position has always been that foreign entities should not interfere in our domestic issues, especially political issues or controversial social issues with political overtones. These are political, social or moral choices for Singaporeans to decide for ourselves. LGBT issues are one such example.
""This is why under the rules governing the use of the Speakers' Corner, for events like the Pink Dot, foreigners are not allowed to organise or speak at the events, or participate in demonstrations.""
The statement has drawn a flurry of criticism online and in mainstream media. I must confess it got me a bit puzzled too.
First, when is a foreign entity foreign, and when is it resident?
This year, there were 18 corporate sponsors of Pink Dot. They included Google, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft. Local sponsors included PS.Cafe and Cavenagh Law.
Pink Dot's organisers have stated that its sponsors are all registered and incorporated in Singapore. As writer George Hwang put it pointedly in a commentary on The Online Citizen website: ""You cannot consider MNCs' locally incorporated subsidiaries as 'Singaporean' for tax purposes and as alien for Speakers' Corner.""
The issue of what is ""foreign"" when applied to Pink Dot sponsors is one grey area.
Another grey area is what constitutes ""interference"".
If sponsoring an event constitutes interference, then why do iconic summits organised by Singapore government agencies seek sponsorship from companies, including foreign ones? The World Cities Summit and Singapore Energy Summit, for example, both have foreign sponsors. In the cities summit, there is a discussion on whether culture matters in a city - a potentially sociopolitical issue.
The Singapore International Film Festival includes Swiss watch manufacturer IWC Schaffhausen as official time partner, and Marina Bay Sands, a subsidiary of Las Vegas Sands Corp, as present- ing sponsor. Movies too can feature ""controversial social issues with political overtones"" - as we know from the Government's periodic moves to ban the public screening of films such as Tan Pin Pin's To Singapore with Love.
Will the ban on foreign sponsorship be extended beyond the pro-gay Pink Dot event, to film and other cultural events and even conferences on socio-political themes? If not, why single out Pink Dot as an event that cannot get foreign sponsors?
Or perhaps the concern about Pink Dot is over law and order, given its rising popularity. Attendance rose from 2,500 in its first year in 2009 to 28,000 last year. Gay pride parades in Turkey and Russia, among others, have sparked riots, sometimes when anti-gay protesters clashed with gay pride marchers. Last week's horrific mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando highlights the potential for violence over this polarising issue. But if law and order were a concern, MHA should say so explicitly and offer solutions that make sense from a security point of view, not restrict foreign sponsors.
In making the arguments above, I am merely trying to sketch out the anomalies and contradictions that ensue when one tries to apply the rule that ""foreign entities should not interfere in our domestic issues, especially political issues or controversial social issues with political overtones"".
To be sure, the rule on no foreign interference in domestic politics is not a new one. I think most Singaporeans would support the line in the sand against foreign meddling drawn by this Govern- ment. I, for one, certainly do.
We want to evolve our political system at a pace we are comfortable with. We do not want, or need, foreign democracy activists or human rights groups - some with dubious sources of funding - to push our tiny, fragile and extremely beloved island-nation down paths we will find hard to turn back from.
What is unsettling about the MHA statement is its addition of the category of ""controversial social issues with political tones"" to the list of off-limits issues for foreigners. This definition is so widely written that it can become a trawler net to catch any issues that become embarrassing or inconvenient to the Government.
Already, activist group Aware has asked if its advocacy work - such as on workplace harassment, and support for single parents - will be affected by the rule.
Citing the latter issue, Aware executive director Corinna Lim wrote in The Straits Times' Forum page: ""If a group objects to this and floods the Government with letters of complaint, would it become a 'controversial' social issue? Would any support we might have from foreign entities thus be deemed 'interference'?
""We are troubled by these potential implications of MHA's statement, which is ambiguous, leaves too much open to possibly arbitrary interpretation, and seems to go much further than previous pronouncements.""
Ms Lim has a valid concern.
Singapore is at a transition point.
We have a Committee on the Future Economy to chart our economic blueprint. We are rethinking our school and training model, to integrate in-school and after-school learning better. We are concerned about the limits of our meritocracy system, and want to broaden our social safety net.
We should not close ourselves off, mentally or culturally, from the rich debates raging worldwide on many issues of social equity that have a bearing on the challenges we face. These range from income inequality to disruptive technologies and the impact these will have on jobs and incomes, to the equity of health systems, and to the continued relevance of our industrial-model education system.
Many of these issues can all justifiably be described as ""controversial social issues with political overtones"". What does keeping out foreign interference in these issues then mean? No foreign sponsors , even from local subsidiaries of foreign firms? No foreign academics allowed to speak at a conference on these issues? What is a ""foreign academic"" anyway? Does a foreign lecturer at a local university count?
There are many grey areas and questions arising from this loosely written rule against foreign interference in ""controversial social issues with political overtones"".
Keeping debate on difficult social issues entirely local hinders our ability to learn from the experiences of others. An open, inclusive attitude can help us better reach a national consensus on difficult issues.
As for LGBT issues, they are certainly contentious and emotionally charged because they deal with people's freedom to love without breaking the law, and some religions have clear teachings against homosexual practices. Debate on these issues will be fractious. They may even be ""controversial social issues with political overtones"". Pro- and anti-gay camps may want to tap foreign sponsors and foreign groups (such as churches, universities, organisations) to talk to Singaporeans about such issues.
To be sure, it makes for a messier socio-political environment.
But do LGBT issues fall under the category of domestic politics that is core to Singapore's interests and identity as a nation, and from which foreign participation and sponsorship of events should be banned? I do not think so.
Singaporeans are a nationalistic lot. We will support a government that ringfences our political system and domestic political contests from foreign interference.
But Singaporeans are also a probing, sceptical bunch.
If the Government wants to keep out foreigners from some debates and events, yet include them in others, we need more convincing on why, and how.

"," Society
","   Editor-at-large Han Fook Kwang's book, Singapore In Transition: Hope, Anxiety And Question Marks, is truly an introspection of us as a people and country (""Retired ST editor's book holds up mirror to Singapore society""; last Friday).
While it is evident that we have progressed economically, we still lack a shared social consciousness that makes us a civil society.
Perhaps we have been too obsessed with catching up.
We start the marathon early - getting into elite schools, and competing for scholarships and jobs.
In the workplace, it is about promotions and job titles. Society seems to judge us by what we own - condominiums, cars and credit cards. The cycle continues with our children on what schools they attend and how they fare in national exams.
Thus, we have been conditioned to be self-centred. Life is about self-preservation. Someone's gain is another's loss. Competition is keen, if not cut-throat.
Consequently, we have become a stratified society.
We are huddled into standardised labels for quick identification, whether it be age, income, profession or dwelling.
Meritocracy has been substituted with parentocracy. The ""haves"" become more entrenched with their material superiority. Ironically, while we call for inclusivity, we live more exclusively.
Is there hope? Can we make Singapore a kind and considerate place?
It begins with each and every one of us. There is always room for divergent views. Ideas should be considered based on their merits, not how quickly we stick labels on them. We should seize this disruptive era to rethink new ways to address old problems.
Surely, there is more than one definition of success.
Adults should be exemplary in our treatment of people less like ourselves. Children will then learn to accept others.
Social graciousness should be recognised. No one should be discounted or be made to feel less worthy because of who he is.
While we pursue excellence, we should think about issues larger than ourselves. While we celebrate our blessings, we should be considerate of the less fortunate.
We should live to enlarge the collective good so that more people can draw from it.
If every one of us thinks less of ""self"" and more of ""them"", Singapore will certainly be a First World society.

","   For Singapore's entrepreneurship landscape to reflect the diversity of its society, business owners and young people from minority groups must have equal access to funding and opportunities, a United States official has said.
This is important as entrepreneurship can act as a powerful counter to violent extremism while also exposing the young to new ideas, noted Mr Shaarik Zafar, the US Department of State's Special Representative to Muslim Communities.
Mr Shaarik was speaking to journalists on the sidelines of the three-day Global Entrepre- neurship Summit which ended yesterday, at the Stanford University campus in California.
Almost 700 entrepreneurs and about 300 investors from around the world took part in the summit, including at least seven representatives from Singapore.
Mr Shaarik has made three visits to Singapore, most recently in May this year when he met Singapore's Minister for Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli.
""Singapore's diversity, just like diversity in other countries, is its strength,"" he said in response to questions from The Straits Times at the Summit.
""Singapore has strong rule of law and access to capital. But the challenge is, as in many parts of the world, sometimes minority youth don't have access to this,"" he noted.
""I think the key is mentorship, and often that means people mentoring young people outside their community.""
Mr Shaarik added that Singapore can be an ""important role model"" when it comes to helping mi- norities access entrepreneurship opportunities.
""The next step is engaging Muslim youth and other minority youth, and making sure they have access to the same training, the same mentorship and the same capital... It is important that all aspects of Singaporean society are able to access (these).""
Mr Fazal Bahardeen, the chief executive of halal travel firms CrescentRating and HalalTrip, said there is a growing number of Malay-Muslim entrepreneurs in Singapore who are mostly focused on the Muslim consumer market.
Although this is a fast-growing segment, it can still be challenging for Muslim entrepreneurs in the region to access funding, he noted.
""It could be due to a lack of understanding of its real market potential or that investors are reluctant to get involved in targeting the Muslim segment... Whatever the reason, the result is that raising capital for such start-ups is even more difficult in an already difficult fund-raising environment,"" said Mr Fazal.
Still, Singapore's diverse society puts it in good stead to become a strong player in the Muslim market.
""The community has matured in its understanding of practising the faith in a multicultural environment, together with Singapore's environment of high corporate governance, transparency and meritocracy,"" said Mr Fazal.
""This combination is favourable to build Singapore's business position as a strong player in the Muslim consumer market globally.""
At the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, Mr Shaarik also told journalists that promoting entrepreneurship is a ""fundamental part"" of US President Barack Obama's foreign policy ""because we recognise entrepreneurship is directly linked to stability, economic growth and connectivity with the world"".
His comments echoed remarks made by US Secretary of State John Kerry earlier in the day, during the official opening of the Summit.
Entrepreneurship can create jobs and opportunities for young people all over the world who might otherwise be vulnerable to violent extremist ideas, Mr Kerry told the audience.
""Think of the peril if we leave those minds, which have the same desires that many of you do here, if we leave them to the pickings of extremists and exploiters and demagogues,"" he added.
""(Entrepreneurs) provide a highly visible and very effective rebuttal to the propaganda of violent extremist groups. Because your optimism provides an alternative to their nihilism. Because you are trying to build the brighter future that in fact these folks are determined to prevent.""

","   The Brexit outcome is being blamed by many on the British govern- ment's failure over the years to cushion the costs of globalisation.
The story being written? That the winners of globalisation chose Remain, the losers chose Leave.
The Telegraph newspaper's analysis of the results, for instance, showed that voters with less wealth and education backed Brexit.
Brexit also resonated strongly with the UK's older generation, with areas that scored the highest anti-European Union votes having the greatest numbers of pensioners.
Britain's membership in an expanding EU meant it benefited from - but also had to handle the consequences of - the EU's ""four freedoms"": freedom of movement of goods, people, services and capital over borders.
OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE IT TO THE TOP
Social mobility is higher in Singapore than in most European countries, but it's declining. We have to watch that our system gives avenues for the bottom fifth of the population to make it to the top.
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR REUBEN WONG, an associate fellow at the EU Centre in Singapore.
In a commentary published in The Guardian, Mr Gordon Brown, Britain's prime minister from 2007 to 2010, argued that ""the key lesson of Brexit is that globalisation must work for all of Britain"".
And in Britain, industrial towns were hollowed out as manufacturing collapsed in the face of Asian competition, wrote Mr Brown.
""These towns are home to a disproportionate share of the semi- skilled workers who feel on the wrong side of globalisation and who opted to vote leave.
""Unable to see how globalisation can be tamed in their interests, they have, not surprisingly, become recruits to an anti-globalisation movement whose lightning rod is migration,"" he said.
Their difficulty in learning new skills and finding new jobs was not helped by the entry of EU workers willing to work long hours, in less than ideal conditions, for less.
THE SINGAPORE TAKEAWAY
Singapore has had similar debates on income inequality and immigration, says Institute of Policy Studies deputy director of research Gillian Koh.
Throughout the years, the People's Action Party Government has ""worked towards taking the best policy ideas from the political right and left to strike a working balance in a broad centre"", she says.
This means, for instance, being market-oriented while having the state actively ensuring that economic growth translates to social development, by heavily redistributing the benefits of growth.
There is the Workfare policy that supplements the income of low- wage workers, for example.
In taking this approach, difficult choices were made, says Dr Koh.
She points to how the Government decided to temper the growth rate of the foreign workforce.
It promotes productivity and innovation instead.
Though the policy is unpopular with business owners, especially small firms hit hard by the manpower crunch, the Government has made it clear it will not turn the foreign worker tap back on.
""The price continues to be paid to ensure that any sort of backlash against globalisation, market capitalism and immigration is mitigated even in a very small and open economy like ours,"" says Dr Koh.
Lately, the Government has also been making sure that people stay employable, so that they are not caught out as jobs shift elsewhere in the global economy.
The Manpower Ministry and its agencies have rolled out a slew of training programmes for those more vulnerable to rapid technological changes.
The SkillsFuture drive to help Singaporeans master skills also gives Singaporeans $500 a year in credits that can be used to pay for approved training courses.
What Singapore has to watch out for is ""a danger of the dispossessed feeling very frustrated, that they have no hope for the future"", as National University of Singapore political scientist Reuben Wong puts it.
For now, the poor in Singapore still have a better crack at improving their lives through the opportunities of meritocracy and the education system, says Associate Professor Wong, an associate fellow at the EU Centre in Singapore.
""Social mobility is higher in Singapore than in most European countries, but it's declining. We have to watch that our system gives avenues for the bottom fifth of the population to make it to the top.""
Agreeing, UniSIM labour economist Walter Theseira argues that people must believe that ordinary citizens can benefit from globalisation and international openness if they work hard.
Otherwise, ""no amount of public welfare spending will convince people that this is a good deal"", he says.
""Most people prefer to earn a decent wage than to have money given to them because they lost their jobs from globalisation.""

","   Singapore's management of ethnic and religious differences has dampened the lure of extremism in the country, but global events show the allure of radicalism remains very potent, said Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam.
In recent months, there has been a wave of terrorist attacks in Europe, and France, in particular, has been hit hard.
This has led some to ask ""Why France?"", Mr Shanmugam told reporters on Friday when the Government announced that four men have been arrested under the Internal Security Act for terrorism-related activities.
While he stressed that he does not have the answer, he noted the ""slightly different approach"" France and Singapore take on race and religion.
He compared four key areas, even as he acknowledged that France - a large country with a long history - is unlike Singapore.
A WORK IN PROGRESS
They are not going to go away any time soon. Let's recognise them and then let's see how we work on them to achieve a higher ideal.
MR K. SHANMUGAM, Minister for Home Affairs and Law, on ethnic differences.
For instance, French official documents do not record the ethnic identity of its citizens. In Singapore, identity cards state the race of an individual and some Singaporeans have asked about the need for it. ""Many people say, in the IC why are they saying 'race'...why not just say Singaporeans?"" he said.
Although Singapore has somewhat succeeded in forming a Singaporean identity, he said ethnic differences have not gone away.
""They are not going to go away any time soon. Let's recognise them and then let's see how we work on them to achieve a higher ideal,"" he added.
Singapore also forbids the denigration of religion that many Western countries allow in the name of freedom of speech.
""We will not, for example, allow the kind of religious satire that publications can put up, of Catholic nuns engaging in sexual acts or burning of the Quran, in the US under the framework of freedom of speech,'' Mr Shanmugam said.
He added: ""Such publications won't be allowed. Burning of religious books will not be allowed. So we take a stricter approach.""
Also, Singapore's housing policies prevent ethnic enclaves from being formed. ""We live in mixed communities and that's part of our ethnic integration policy - active intervention by the state,"" he said.
Such ethnic enclaves are found in many countries, including France, but ""whether that resulted in these attacks, I can't say"", he stressed.
Singapore also ensures adequate representation of different communities, he said, adding that minorities must feel they have a stake in society and fair participation in all aspects of life, including politics, business and academia.
Singapore's group representation constituency (GRC) system guarantees that minorities are represented in Parliament. ""If you had a Parliament that did not have that representation... minority communities will feel different about their say and stake in what's happening.""
Based on these fundamentals, Singapore has spent decades building tolerance, acceptance and appreciation across religious and racial lines, Mr Shanmugam said.
It is still a work in progress.
He added: ""Minorities must not feel shut out unfairly. Meritocracy is important, but they must not feel that there are other factors at play that keep them out.""
Community and religious leaders also subscribe to ""a common vision for Singapore and a Singaporean identity and subscribe to a secular elected government"".
Despite the progress, the fight against extremism is ongoing, he said, adding: ""Now, we also have to say a big 'no' to extremism and all teachings that tend towards extremism. Otherwise, the ground would become fertile for extremist teachings to be absorbed and then for terrorism.""
Returning to the question of why terrorists are targeting France, he said: ""I'm in no position to say but we do some things differently from France based on our history, our geography, our culture. And, so far, it has worked for us but the currents sweeping across the world are very powerful and we are going to face challenging times.""

","   In the face of challenges posed by possible tensions in Asia, the threat of terrorism and a slowing economy, Singaporeans may have certain fears and frustrations.
But as Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong highlighted in a speech at a National Day dinner in Marine Parade last night, what is needed to assuage these feelings is good leadership that can steer Singapore confidently into the future.
At the dinner at Roland Restaurant, Mr Goh, an MP for Marine Parade GRC, cited two anxieties that may affect Singaporeans.
First, there is a fear that ""the Singaporean dream - the ability to make a better life for themselves and for their children - is slipping from the grasp of the next generation"".
Second, he said there could also be ""the frustration that the Singaporean identity and meritocracy, predicated on equality amid diversity, is increasingly skewed"".
EMERGING LEADERSHIP TEAM
I see a core leadership team emerging. They had won the support of the people in the last general election and are working hard to prove themselves.
EMERITUS SENIOR MINISTER GOH CHOK TONG
""Our minority groups, in particular, worry that their opportunities are less than others' because of their race, language or religion.""
Mr Goh said that such anxieties are not new, and have been with Singapore since independence.
But ""concrete meaning"" must be given to Singapore's value of inclusiveness, with national unity of paramount importance.
He said citizens must not forget ""those among us who struggle to keep up, or feel that they are losing to newcomers in their own land"".
On leadership, Mr Goh said the qualities needed in leaders include the imagination and competence to overcome problems and implement solutions; the courage to make painful but necessary decisions; the ability to mobilise Singaporeans to achieve common goals; and the vision to inspire hope and confidence in Singaporeans for the future.
Most importantly, he stressed, leaders must have the trust of the people.
""They must put the people above their own ambition and interests. Political power is not about stature or building legacies but to do good for others.""
He noted that Singapore's leadership succession is on track, and expressed his confidence in the new Members of Parliament and ministers who are ""capable, dedicated and hard-working"".
""I see a core leadership team emerging. They had won the support of the people in the last general election and are working hard to prove themselves.""
Singapore's democratic processes have produced honest, competent and dedicated leaders over three political generations in the last 51 years, Mr Goh added.
""But as any good investor knows, past performance of a company does not guarantee future results.""
He urged the Singaporean electorate to play its part in ensuring that a tradition of competent leadership remains in place.
""Our people are the bedrock of our democracy. They are ultimately responsible for choosing the leaders of our country. So my message to Singaporeans is: Stay involved in your community, be informed of events in and outside Singapore, and demand integrity in our politics and policies.""
Singapore can continue to excel if it is nimble and adaptable, said Mr Goh, adding that he was heartened to see the growth of social activism among Singaporeans who take action when they see vulnerabilities within society rather than wait for the Government to do something.
""When these two halves come together - wise leaders and involved citizens - you will have an exciting future.""

","   A minority candidate who runs for president will find it hard to beat a rival from the majority race, all else being equal.
But at the same time, Singapore cannot afford to let minorities be shut out of the highest office of the land for too long.
Otherwise, Singapore's national unity and the sense of national identity among minorities will be weakened.
This frank assessment of how much race mattered in the state of the nation and what is at stake was given by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last night as he made the case for why changes to the elected presidency were needed.
He set out his argument in his Malay, Mandarin and English National Day Rally speeches last night before he took ill.
MATTER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
This is serious, for it concerns our social cohesion, our multiracial society and our future.
PM LEE, on how the current system may not allow Singapore to have a non-Chinese president for a long time.
Mr Lee argued that a safeguard is needed to ensure a minority - that is, a non-Chinese Singaporean - becomes president from time to time. Having a minority president is critical because Singapore is a multiracial society, and the President as head of state symbolises the nation.
Every Singaporean has to be able to identify with him and know that someone of his community can become president, Mr Lee added.
But the reality is that it is hard for a minority candidate to win a presidential election today, as the deck is stacked against him from the start.
Singapore has undoubtedly made much progress in becoming one people, regardless of race, language or religion, he noted.
But findings of a recent Channel NewsAsia-Institute of Policy Studies survey of 2,000 show race relations here is a work in progress.
It found that three out of four people believe race does not influence success. Also, most people believe the interest of one's own race should not come before the interests of other races, a belief held as well by most of the Chinese majority polled.
But Singapore is not completely race-blind.While most Singaporeans across all races accept a president or prime minister of another race, they also said they preferred one from their own race.
Mr Lee noted that elections are hotly contested today.
""Now that the President is elected in a national election, it is harder for a non-Chinese to get elected as president,"" he said.
Singapore in 50 years had only one Malay president, Mr Yusof Ishak, from 1965 to 1970.
If a minority president is not elected ""for a long time, minorities will become disappointed and uneasy, and rightly so"", said Mr Lee.
He added that this issue can be politicised and manipulated to provoke ill-feelings in minority communities and divide Singapore in the future.
This is why Singapore must make changes to the elected president system now, while things are still peaceful and the society is united, he said.
Mr Lee also addressed concerns he had heard. These include people asking why such elections could not be left alone to run their natural course.
""Some may feel that since we are a majority-Chinese country, when a Chinese president is elected, it is all right,"" he said in Mandarin.
But the reality of the multiracial society here is that under the current system, Singapore may not have a non-Chinese president for a long time, he said.
""This is serious, for it concerns our social cohesion, our multiracial society and our future,"" he said in Mandarin.
Another concern was that changes might compromise the principle of meritocracy.
But he stressed that the same stringent qualifying criteria will be maintained, no matter the race of the candidate for president.
Even after the changes, an elected president from a minority race will still be as fully qualified as any other president, he added.
PM Lee took ill and later, when he returned to the stage, he said he would discuss the issue further on another occasion.
His office, however, released what he was scheduled to have said on the elected presidency in a statement to the media.
Mr Lee noted that it would not be the first time Singapore had introduced special provisions for minorities.
About 30 years ago, it introduced group representation constituencies, or GRCs, in general elections. Candidates had to run in teams that must include at least one person from a minority race.
When the idea was first floated, the minority communities had misgivings, saying it would be patronising and they did not need it, said Mr Lee.
But people now accept GRCs, which are an important stabiliser ensuring there will always be minority MPs in Parliament, whatever the election outcome, he added.
He acknowledges such a change in the elected presidency is a delicate problem that is legally hard to draft, politically sensitive to explain, and something that takes time to accept.
But the change is necessary so that a minority Singaporean can regularly become president ""to represent what we feel about Singapore, and our ideal of a multiracial society"", Mr Lee said.
It will strengthen racial harmony in Singapore ""so that a generation from now, Singaporeans of all races will feel even closer to one another"".

","   In a fit of anger, the boss of Mr S R Nathan ordered him to sack an officer who had made a mistake.
But Mr Nathan, a mid-level civil servant then, moved the man to a corner table in the office instead, out of the sight of his infuriated boss.
Days later, his boss saw the man, called Mr Nathan and told him: ""I would have been aghast if you had gone ahead and fired him. You did the right thing.""
That was in the 1970s.
Already, he demonstrated the traits that would take him far in life: his independent judgment, boldness tempered with diplomacy and, above all, kind-heartedness.
The incident also typified his work ethos, recalled Mr Tan Eng Beng, 58, principal private secretary to Mr Nathan from 2005 to 2011 when he was president.
Each morning, Mr Nathan would carefully comb through the newspaper and whenever he came across a report of an individual down on his luck, Mr Tan was asked to find out how the person was being helped.
Tributes poured in on Facebook and from people who went to the Ceylon Road home of the late former president S R Nathan to pay their respects.
CONTRIBUTION TO HERITAGE
For us in the heritage scene, Mr Nathan left a strong contribution. He was instrumental in starting up a very important institution that we launched last year - the Indian Heritage Centre. His was a guiding hand in the early phase of development, which we very much needed. He also donated his personal effects, photographs and wartime publications to the centre.

EPITOME OF MERITOCRACY

He was, I believe, the epitome of meritocracy in Singapore, having risen through the ranks to reach the highest and most prestigious office of the land.
MR CHANDRA DAS, 77, chairman of Tamil Murasu newspaper and non-resident High Commissioner to Sri Lanka.
MAN OF COURAGE
If you knew Dr Goh, you would know that it took great courage for someone to disagree with him.
Mr Nathan did, and Dr Goh eventually came round to change his opinion of the officers he had initially condemned.
Mr Nathan's explanation was that sometimes, our political masters needed time to cool down, and they would then regret their initial impulsive decisions to sack those they thought were wanting.
PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN EDDIE TEO, in a Facebook post, on how the late Mr S R Nathan was not afraid to stand up to then Defence Minister Goh Keng Swee when working under him.
""He would open the newspaper and say, 'Hey, this boy is sleeping at the bus stop, what are MCYS (the then Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports) and others doing to help him? Please tell me,' "" he recounted.
The instinctive acts of compassion are Mr Tan's most cherished memories of Mr Nathan, whom he saw for the final time on Monday afternoon at the Singapore General Hospital, hours before Mr Nathan died at the age of 92.
As his aide, Mr Tan had a front-row view of the former president's relentless effort to fund the education of poor students.
He recalled a group of Malay students who did well and were admitted to prestigious British universities including Cambridge University and Imperial College London.
But they could not go on their own dime or that of self-help group Mendaki, which does not fund overseas education.
When he heard about their plight, Mr Nathan personally arranged for donors to pay their fees.
He went a step further and asked public agencies to give the students internships and jobs so that they would return to Singapore.
""He said we should do what we can to help them succeed in the universities there and then come back and be leaders of the community here in Singapore,"" said Mr Tan.
Mr Nathan could also be counted on when aid schemes or groups like the Chinese Development Assistance Council did not pay for tertiary education: ""He asked all these agencies and people to let him know if they came across someone who needed support.""
Mr Tan added: ""He must have easily helped more than a hundred people this way over the years, without letting them know that he was the one supporting them. He never wanted to be acknowledged.""
Helping with an invisible hand was his way of living his strong belief that education improves lives.
Growing up with little, he received a bursary from oil giant Shell to study social work at the then University of Malaya in Singapore. He was 28.
He also set up the S R Nathan Education Upliftment Fund in 2011 to support disadvantaged polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education students. Said Mr Tan: ""He always wanted to give back.""
For Mr Nathan, no individual was too unimportant and no detail too troublesome to look at - two qualities that stood out in his work.
He was an exacting boss who held those under him to high standards, said Mr Tan. ""Whenever he had any questions, he would call me over, and I had to be very clear about a recommendation or decision I made.""
He held himself to the same standards: no cutting corners.
He would meticulously examine every piece of legislation before he gave his presidential approval.
Recounted Mr Tan: ""He scrutinised whatever the Government put up, to the extent that government agencies were sometimes quite unhappy with me because I was the one who had to query them.
""They would say, 'Why are you asking all these questions?' ""
On state visits, Mr Nathan - a former diplomat - always had a foreign policy goal he wanted to achieve, said Mr Tan.
""He's not just going there to have tea with the president of the other side.""
Part of his responsibility as president was to consider the clemency pleas of death row inmates, and to sign their death warrants.
""He would even call up the Attorney-General to make sure he was doing right by the person, that he understood the case and was not signing blindly. He had this sense of trying to be fair to everyone,"" said Mr Tan.
Mr Nathan was unafraid to disagree when he felt something was not right.
For instance, he disagreed with the decision to build casinos in Singapore, and gave his views to the ministers of the day.
But he could see beyond his personal preference and accept what was for the national good.
When he said yes to a request from the Government, he would do so ""not because he knows the Prime Minister or Mr Lee Kuan Yew, but because it's the right thing to do"".
""He always took the position that you cannot change what others think. There will always be criticism,"" said Mr Tan.
""But as long as his conscience is clear, he could live with it. And his conscience was clear.""

","   Multicultural living might be passive, as when one merely tolerates diversity. Living multiculturalism, however, is active. It is about embracing the variety of experiences that a multiracial society can offer. The difference between the two characterises Singaporeans' attitudes towards race.
Many pay lip service to multiracialism. After all, the very rationale for the independence of Singapore was a quest for a multiracialism that could break free of an entrenched political economy of racial privilege. The adoption of meritocracy as the basic principle of economic success strengthened the idea of multiracialism. Shared experiences, street food, national icons and Singlish all have contributed to making multiracialism an unremarkable feature of contemporary Singapore life.
Reality, unfortunately, lags behind ideals at times. This is reiterated by a Channel NewsAsia- Institute of Policy Studies survey which shows that, while Singaporeans strongly support multiracialism and meritocracy, there are contradictions beneath the surface. Almost half of them recognise that racism can be a problem and are aware that there are a significant number who are at least mildly racist. Even more worryingly, Singaporeans reveal a sharp contrast between accepting other races on a casual and social level, and preferring their own race in personal and political settings. What this could mean is that multiracialism is fine so long as it does not intrude into the two defining realms of the individual: his private existence, where he is sovereign; and the political sphere, which sustains his identity.
Living multiracialism must go beyond token multiculturalism. This entails the willingness of people to invite those from other races home for a meal, or allow children or grandchildren to play with kids of other races. Reassuringly, Singapore has begun that journey. About 70 per cent of respondents in the survey found outright discrimination unacceptable, such as not hiring someone because of race or religion, or insulting others because of race. That they viewed such acts as racist and not normal shows that Singaporeans do not pretend that divisive ethnicity does not exist in their midst.
Personal mindsets and habitual interactions must not revolve around race but must draw on the larger and shared legacies of heritage, history and culture. That is the only way Singapore as a whole can remain strong. If parents believe that this is the future they want for their children, they must inculcate the values of an inclusive society at home, not least by example. Civic nationalism will come naturally to the young when parents think of Singapore as a nation for all its people, regardless of race and religion. Schools will succeed in reinforcing the message only if it is there in the first place. Multiracialism weathers the elements best when its roots are planted early on in life.

","   Equal opportunity and social mobility are things that our Government has strived to promote since Singapore's founding. I found it interesting, therefore, that in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech on Sunday, he singled out disruption from globalisation and technological progress as the ""defining"" economic challenge of our generation.
In his speech, he acknowledged how segments of society (e.g. taxi drivers and retail staff) have had their livelihoods threatened by new technology and alluded to the need for the Government to help incumbents adapt while levelling the playing field for everyone.
I would argue that disruption has not just widened the income or wealth gap, it has also skewed the odds in favour of the privileged and highly educated at the expense of the blue-collar worker, thereby creating a ""skills gap"" which many struggle to bridge. In a world where game-changing competition can materialise in an instant (thanks to free trade or a new smartphone app, for example), those who have spent their whole lives in a particular profession may find their livelihoods diminished or having disappeared overnight. It is fanciful to think that the only thing preventing an out-of-work factory assistant from retraining to be an in-demand software engineer is hard work and determination. This is not to say we ought to resist change in a Luddite fashion. But we should nonetheless be cognisant of the fact that economic progress is not positive for everyone, or even the majority, in society.
Recent government initiatives such as SkillsFuture and KidStart - effectively subsidising education for those who need or want it, from pre-schoolers to retirees - are a step in the right direction, but more can be done to help shrink the opportunity gap. We could start with something even more basic than education.
Public transport, for example, is a necessary expenditure for the almost 60 per cent of households without a car. The adults need to get to work and the kids need to get to school, and walking or cycling are rarely feasible options. While the Government already subsidises transportation costs and invests billions in infrastructure, I think policymakers could consider gradually increasing subsidies further so that the real, inflation-adjusted costs to commuters fall over time, to the point where they might eventually become free (or practically free). Such a move may be considered by some to be radical. However, I think there is a strong moral and economic case for it.
I would argue that if we want to promote the virtues of education and employment, we should increase accessibility to both - figuratively (by creating more opportunities for learning and work) and literally (by making it cheaper and easier to get to and from schools or offices). Furthermore, as public transportation is a non- discretionary, non-transferable service (as opposed to a luxury good like a gold necklace, which could be resold for cash), it is unlikely to be abused or overconsumed if made free. Given the essential nature of transportation, and the prohibitively high cost of owning a car in Singapore, one can see how ordinary citizens may come to view public transport fares effectively as an unavoidable tax on the masses. Thus, I would suggest that further subsidies would not only be environmentally friendly, by giving people greater incentives to use public transport, they would also act like a tax cut for the general public, boosting disposable incomes, consumption and the overall economy.
Hope and ambition have helped transform Singapore from a colonial backwater to an Asian business hub in 50 years. If we are to survive the next 50 years, it will be crucial to preserve that optimism and drive in our future generations as well, with small tweaks and gestures to make an unfair world a little fairer.
Another idea I would champion, in our effort to create an environment of equal opportunity for our young, is to establish a government-backed scheme to offer merit-based internships to post-secondary students (i.e. those in junior colleges, polytechnics, etc).
There are two key reasons for such a proposal: The first is that internships are not just nice to have on a curriculum vitae (CV), but they also provide inexperienced students with valuable insights into potential professions and help them make better choices about the courses they might pursue in university, which will shape the paths they take later in life; the second is that while internships may benefit the interns (or even society as a whole) greatly, they are often a hassle and an irrecoverable cost for the company. Thus, they are underproduced when left to the free market, and become the preserve of the privileged and well-connected rather than those truly deserving of them.
Throughout my professional life, I have worked at financial institutions large and small, from investment banking to financial advisory. At every firm, I have occasionally been asked to let a young intern (usually 16-17 years old) mirror me for half a day. While some are very keen and genuinely grateful for the opportunity to learn, others have been awful, arrogant or generally disinterested. But, in every case, their backgrounds have been similar - they were either the children of our wealthy clients or friends of senior management. These young interns, with their connections and embellished CVs, will presumably have the best chance of being the lawyers and bankers of tomorrow, and that strikes me as being not just unfair but unhealthy for a meritocracy such as ours.
THE REDISTRIBUTION OF LUCK
I consider myself very ""lucky"" - to be born in Singapore rather than Somalia, to be a child of the go-go 1980s rather than the war-torn 1940s, and to have had loving parents who invested unreservedly in my education and development from an early age. To be sure, I am not trying to diminish the fact that I have worked hard, taken risks and seized opportunities to achieve my goals, and I certainly did not have the privilege of a ""silver spoon upbringing"". But to deny the role that chance and serendipity have played in my life turning out the way it has would be nothing short of arrogance.
The issue of luck, however, is one that defines and divides opinion. The debate starts at birth because it is clear that we have no control over where and to whom we are born, and yet these two completely arbitrary factors are arguably key inputs in the equation of life outcomes. It is also clear that, given a choice, most of us would prefer to be the offspring of an American millionaire entrepreneur than an African subsistence farmer. It is by this line of reasoning that those of a leftist disposition justify greater economic transfers to those deemed less fortunate, however that may be defined.
But it is also true that fortune favours the brave and I can personally attest to the saying ""The harder I work, the luckier I get"". And so, while others may start with more chips, and the odds at the roulette table of life are naturally stacked against you, there is nothing preventing you from stepping up to earn another spin of the wheel. It is imperative, however, that we all get the same odds, because our society (and indeed, our success) is founded on the basis of meritocracy and a strong work ethic. It is a system which doesn't seek to guarantee equal outcomes but equal opportunity, and where those at the top of organisations, be they public or private, are our most capable and qualified. So if we ever believe the game to be rigged, the incentive to keep playing is lost and the system breaks down.
It is for this reason that our leaders have treated, and need to continue treating, the issues of widening income gaps and social mobility so seriously. It is also for this reason that we should continually recalibrate the scales to ensure that every Singaporean has a fair shot at a better and brighter future, all the while avoiding the temptation (and pitfalls) of the welfare state.
Hope and ambition have helped transform Singapore from a colonial backwater to an Asian business hub in 50 years. If we are to survive the next 50 years, it will be crucial to preserve that optimism and drive in our future generations as well, with small tweaks and gestures to make an unfair world a little fairer.

","   Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu, in explaining the upcoming changes to the elected presidency, said yesterday the goal is to send a strong signal that a person from a minority race can represent Singapore.
She also indicated that it will make clear the majority race wants to be represented by a minority president. ""We're sending a signal to all minority races that if... the head of state is to represent the entire society, it's important from time to time to have a minority holding that important position for us,"" Ms Fu said at a closed-door dialogue.
About 70 young people attended the day-long session to discuss the key points of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech. Reporters were allowed into the session in the final hour.
PM Lee had said the Constitution would be changed to ensure ethnic minorities are elected as president from time to time.
The youth, in talking about their experiences of racism, wondered whether the majority race enjoys some advantages in society here.
If so, Ms Fu said, something should be done so that ""our minority brothers and sisters"" are clear that ""we do want them to represent us as president"".
However, if minority candidates are not at a disadvantage, Singaporeans will naturally vote for the candidate best suited for the job, regardless of race, she added.
The safeguard then will be needed only if no minority individual holds the office of head of state from time to time, she said.
Youth worker Jed Senthil said he and his friends were concerned the move might be an act of tokenism.
Said the 30-year-old: ""A Malay friend said he doesn't want a Malay president for the sake of having a token one. It doesn't make him proud.
""I'm sure there are capable candidates among all races.""
Replying, Ms Fu said she did not have details of the changes, but ""minority or not, the same set of criteria will apply"". Meritocracy will still be the core value upheld, she said.
Mr Senthil later told The Straits Times he would prefer that greater efforts be made to find and coax minority candidates to run, rather than make changes to the presidency.
The youth also discussed common values held by Singaporeans, like treasuring multiculturalism.
Mr Khairul Hilmi Mohd Khair, 27, a social service professional, said there was a need for the different races to trust each other more.
He said the ""true test of our multiculturalism'' will come the day Singapore is attacked by radicalised Muslim terrorists. ""That's when we see how much you'll trust your Muslim friends.""
Ms Fu replied that in such an event, she hoped youth like Mr Khairul would take the lead and set the tone by calling for unity.

","   Singapore has come a long way in building a nation where every citizen has equal standing and rights, but race still matters when it comes to politics and how people cast their vote, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said.
This is why it is necessary to amend the Constitution to ensure a president from Singapore's minority races is elected from time to time, he said in an interview with Mediacorp's Debra Soon that was broadcast last night.
""We have come a long way. It's not a Chinese or Malay or an Indian nation. Everybody has his place, everybody is equal... People believe in this ideal and believe that we have made progress towards this ideal,"" he said. ""But at the same time, it doesn't mean that we have become colour blind because we are different races, different languages, different religions, and those factors are still important to us and will be for a very long time to come.""
Mr Lee spoke on the issue of race and the elected presidency during his National Day Rally last month, but he took ill and did not complete his prepared remarks on the topic.
In the TV interview shown yesterday, he took the opportunity to explain his thinking on the subject, ahead of the release of a Constitutional Commission's report on proposed changes to the elected presidency, including ensuring a minority candidate is elected from time to time.
Mr Lee cited a recent survey done by Channel NewsAsia and the Institute of Policy Studies that showed people were more willing to accept members of their own race marrying into their family. A significant number of respondents also indicated greater acceptance for someone of their own race to be president.
This shows that race still counts in elections, Mr Lee said, adding that it means a Malay or Indian candidate for president will inevitably face difficulties that someone from the majority race might not.
""Not everybody will rule him out but some will find the hurdle higher and so he starts off at a disadvantage - and in a close election, that will make a big difference,"" he said. And though all voters say they will vote for the best candidate, ""that definition differs depending on which voter you ask, and race is one of the factors which go into that"".
Mr Lee said it was important for a minority candidate to be president from time to time, as the head of state represents all Singaporeans. ""Then people see that yes, this is my country. Someone like me can become the head of state, can represent the country.""
The survey also showed younger voters are less race conscious.
But Mr Lee noted: ""The distinction is still there, it hasn't disappeared and I don't think it'll disappear for a long time.""
Even in the United States, where the ideal is a melting pot, President Barack Obama was the first African-American elected to the post after 230 years of independence.
Mr Lee pointed out that fewer than half of white Americans voted for Mr Obama in the 2008 election, but 95 per cent of African-Americans cast their ballots for him. ""It shows that a black man can now win but it shows that race is still a big factor in American elections, which is not so surprising,"" Mr Lee said.
The figures put into perspective Singapore's position, that race is a factor ""we have to accept and... take into account and decide what we're going to do about, to make sure our system will work properly"".
Asked if provisions to guarantee a minority president might be seen as tokenism, Mr Lee replied: ""I don't think it's tokenism. I think it's a very necessary symbolism of what we are as a multiracial society, what Singapore means, stands for and what we aspire to be.""
As such, the mechanism that determines the head of state has to bear this in mind and ""produce an outcome which is multiracial and which will reflect the colour of our society, the shape of our society"".
Mr Lee acknowledged concerns that making such provisions in Singapore's case could be seen as giving a minority candidate an easier path to the presidency, and said such sentiments reflected the success of meritocracy.
""People want to succeed on their own merits and nobody wants to come in on a free ride and be seen that standards have been lowered for a particular race,"" he said.
""So whatever mechanism we do, we have to make sure that the same qualifying criteria apply, same standards, and there cannot be any relaxation or any doubt that the person who's elected is of that quality. And there are minorities who are of that quality,"" he said.
Mr Lee noted that when the president was appointed by Parliament, Singapore had ""eminently qualified"" presidents in Mr Yusof Ishak, Dr Benjamin Sheares, Mr Devan Nair and Mr Wee Kim Wee. ""We want a mechanism which can produce this kind of an outcome, this kind of diversity as an assured outcome, which presently we don't have.""
Mr Lee was also confident the Chinese community would accept such a measure as ""majority Chinese accept that we cannot be a Chinese- Chinese society and that was so right from the beginning"".
""Chinese Singaporeans of that generation... understood that they had to give space to the minorities, that they had to go the extra step to make the minorities feel comfortable living in Singapore... having opportunities like everybody else and not being disadvantaged, that is why we are able to get here today and have a multiracial society.
""If they look at the elected president changes in that spirit, (as) part of being a harmonious, happy, multiracial society, then I think that people will understand and will accept and will support,"" he said.
Mr Lee also said although there is no political pressure to make these changes now, they had to be done for the nation's long-term good.
""We are not in a situation where the minorities are demanding something and the majority is pushing back and saying, 'We don't want it,' "" he said. ""I think it is something that we need to do.""

","   If Singapore has not had a president from a particular racial group for five continuous terms, the next presidential election should be reserved for candidates from that group, a high-level panel tasked to review the elected presidency proposed.
This ensures that the highest office in the land can be held periodically by someone from a minority community, which is crucial as the president symbolises the nation and should reflect its multiracialism, said the Constitutional Commission.
But it made clear that the eligibility criteria for candidates must not be lowered for anyone from particular racial groups to qualify.
The recommendation addresses a much-debated aspect which the commission was asked to look at by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong: whether there should be a special provision in the law to ensure that Singapore has minority presidents from time to time.
The commission, chaired by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, concluded that it is necessary as Singapore is still working towards the ideal of being race-blind, but is not there yet.
In the meantime, there is a pressing need to ensure that no racial group is shut out of the presidency, said the commission.
The country has not had a Malay president since Singapore's first president Yusof Ishak held the post from 1965 to 1970. Before independence, he had been Yang di-Pertuan Negara of the State of Singapore, the precursor to the presidency, from 1959 until 1965.
ULTIMATE GOAL: A RACE-BLIND COMMUNITY
The ultimate destination for our society should be a race-blind community where no safeguards are required to ensure that candidates from different ethnic groups are periodically elected into presidential office. Equally, it seems to be common ground that Singapore as a society cannot affirmatively say that she has already 'arrived'.
THE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION, on why there is a need for a provision to ensure all the major races are represented in the presidency.
In its report to PM Lee, the commission said it is vital that minority candidates do not see the presidency as unattainable. So there are ""strong justifications"" for introducing safeguards that make sure the office ""is not only accessible, but is seen to be accessible, to persons from all the major racial communities in Singapore"", it added.
To achieve this, it proposed a safeguard that kicks in only when there has been no president from any racial group for five terms, which works out to 30 years.
But if no qualified candidate of the particular race emerges, then that election will be opened to candidates of all races. The subsequent election will then be reserved again for candidates of the particular race.
Asked about this proposal, Law Minister K. Shanmugam said the Government is asking the Attorney-General (A-G) for advice on aspects of the commission's recommendations to ensure representation of all the major races in the office of the president.
""The Government will announce its position once the A-G has given his advice and the Government has considered it,"" he said.
The commission, in recommending the model, said it is the least intrusive way of ensuring minority representation.
For one thing, the provision is race-neutral and does not single out any one racial group for protection. It also has a ""natural sunset"" as it may never be triggered if presidents from various racial groups are elected during open elections.
Said the commission: ""It enables the representation of all racial groups in the presidency in a meaningful way while being minimally prescriptive.""
There is also no danger of undermining meritocracy, as long as candidates are held to the same stringent qualifying standards for all elections, it added.
This was an area of concern raised during the commission's hearings in April and May, by some groups and individuals who felt that reserving elections for particular racial groups would result in a president being elected by virtue of his race and not his abilities.
Some others had been against having a special provision, saying it may lead to calls for similar safeguards for other public offices.
But this argument, the commission said, failed to recognise the unique symbolic function that the president plays. ""No other public office - not that of the prime minister, the chief justice or the Speaker of Parliament - is intended to be a personification of the state and a symbol of the nation's unity in the way that the presidency is.""
The commission also said that ""placing undue focus on the custodial role, to the exclusion of the symbolic, would oversimplify what is in truth a multifaceted institution"".
While a key role of the president, after the elected presidency was introduced in 1991, is to safeguard Singapore's reserves, this did not diminish the office's symbolic role.
Former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, in a 1999 interview with The Straits Times, said that ""the convention of rotating the presidency among the races was important to remind Singaporeans that their country was multiracial"", the commission pointed out. After Mr Yusof, Singapore's next presidents were Dr Benjamin Sheares, a Eurasian, then Mr Devan Nair, an Indian, followed by Mr Wee Kim Wee, a Chinese.
The elected presidency came into effect in 1991, and Mr Ong Teng Cheong, a Chinese, was the first Singapore president to be elected at the polls. He was followed by Mr S R Nathan, an Indian, who served for two terms, and current President Tony Tan Keng Yam, a Chinese.
Said the commission: ""It is because of the crucial symbolic role performed by the president that the office should periodically be held by persons from minority races.""

","   The Government has accepted in principle the main recommendations laid out by a panel that reviewed the elected presidency.
In a statement yesterday, Acting Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said the Government will also provide a detailed response to the Constitutional Commission's report in a White Paper next Thursday.
A Constitutional Amendment Bill will subsequently be tabled in Parliament, and the issue debated.
In its report, the commission recommended, among other things, that a presidential election be set aside for candidates of a particular race, if no one of that race has been elected president after five continuous terms.
In his statement, Mr Teo, the Deputy Prime Minister, said every community in Singapore ""must feel that a member of their community has a chance to become president"".President Tony Tan: A comprehensive review
""The Constitutional Commission recently concluded its review on the elected president scheme and submitted its report to the Government, which has made it publicly available today. It is a landmark review, drawing on 25 years of operating a very important institution that is unique to Singapore. I am confident that the upcoming Constitutional amendments will be a milestone for Singapore in ensuring that the elected president scheme stays relevant with time and our local context.
""The commission had earlier sought my input as the incumbent elected president to refine its proposals. Having been in office for five years now, I hope that my first-hand perspectives, of what worked and what might not, have been useful to the review.
""It is commendable that the process undertaken by the commission has been an inclusive one. Despite running on a tight timeline, the commission sought the views of many Singaporeans. Many of the views were thoughtful and constructive. I am heartened that there have been more than a hundred submissions, and that the commission has held a number of public hearings to debate some of the issues. Not only was this process helpful in developing some of these ideas, but it was also a good educational opportunity about the EP and its critical role in Singapore.
""The commission's work has been a comprehensive review of a very important topic. I will study the report and give my views on the specifics at the second reading of the constitutional amendments later this year.""
He was heartened that some people, including those from minority races, argued for a meritocratic approach in which the best person is elected regardless of race.
Even so, the Government has always ensured that ""even as we practise meritocracy, all races in Singapore feel that they have a place and equal opportunities"". Citing the group representation constituency system which ensures a minimum number of minority-race MPs, he said it has ""contributed to maintaining our harmonious multiracial society, though some had objected when it was first introduced"".
POTENTIAL DIFFICULTIES
Ironically, the role of the elected president as a 'check' on the Government would seem to incentivise candidates to campaign on an anti-Government platform. This would be inconsistent with the unifying role of the president. In addition, it can also give rise to real difficulties in the day-to-day business of governance.
THE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION, on the tension between the president's historical and custodial roles.
Mr Teo, who is Acting Prime Minister as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is in Laos for the Asean summit, stressed that minority representation does not mean the qualifying criteria will be lowered.
""Every potential candidate, no matter his race, must still meet the same stringent eligibility criteria to qualify for elections,"" he said.
The commission also proposed changes to tighten eligibility criteria for potential candidates from the public and private sectors. One key change is that a candidate must have had experience running large, complex companies with $500 million in shareholders' equity, up from the current benchmark of $100 million in paid-up capital.
Mr Teo said it is timely to update the criteria now, as the ""scale and complexity"" of the president's responsibilities have grown.
""The commission has struck a balance in its recommendations on the eligibility criteria,"" he said.
The panel also proposed that the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) be expanded and its views be given greater weight when the president and Government disagree. While the Government agrees in principle with the proposals on the CPA, Mr Teo said the details must be studied carefully to ensure the council is not politicised.
The commission also made several suggestions outside its terms of reference, such as having laws to ensure presidential candidates do not mislead voters. In his letter to commission chairman Sundaresh Menon, PM Lee said the Government will ""study these views seriously"".

","   There is a pressing need to introduce a safeguard to ensure Singapore's minority races are not shut out of the highest office in the land, said the report of the panel reviewing the elected presidency.
Even experts who did not like the idea of a safeguard agreed that Singaporeans are not yet able to look past race, it added.
""Singapore cannot yet be considered a post-racial society: This is a reality that must be faced, even if it is one that is not to be endorsed,"" said the report released yesterday.
The point was the panel's response to a sentiment expressed by five of the 19 individuals and groups that gave feedback at public hearings held in April and May this year to get people's views for the review.
The concerned individuals and groups gave various reasons for opposing a safeguard. These included worries that doing so may undermine meritocracy, or constitute racial discrimination. But the panel pointed out that race matters to Singaporeans at the ballot box and, for this reason, argued for the need to ensure minority representation.
The Commission firmly believes that the eligibility criteria should not be compromised.The qualifying criteria are there to ensure only candidates who are likely to have the requisite attributes may run. So long as these criteria remain sufficiently stringent, they will continue to serve their critical function of allowing only persons with the necessary experience and expertise for the job to qualify for President.
Its preferred way of achieving it is to reserve a presidential election for candidates of a particular race, should Singapore fail to elect a president of that race for 30 years.
The recommendation was one of the biggest changes to the elected presidency, and also the most contentious at the public hearings.
The panel took pains to address the concerns raised at the hearings, saying that as Singapore journeys towards being race-blind, the minorities must in the interim be guaranteed the chance to be president from time to time. It also said the practice of reserving elections for a particular race is neither tokenism nor racial discrimination.
Some law dons and political scientists were concerned that a president chosen in an election reserved for his or her race may be viewed as a token president who lacks legitimacy. The commission acknowledges the concern is legitimate.
But perceptions of tokenism may persist to varying degrees, regardless of how the election is structured, it said. Ultimately, it boils down to the president conducting himself with dignity and gravitas, and earning the respect of Singaporeans, the report added.
The report also said reserving elections for particular races does not fall foul of an international treaty that bans racial discrimination, which Singapore has signed.
It pointed out that the treaty, known as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, permits measures taken to advance the position of certain races.
The practice of reserving elections for particular races encourages members of minority races to run for president, the report added.
The commission also rebutted three broad arguments against having a safeguard at all.
The first argument is that minority candidates have done well in general elections, showing minorities do not need a special provision for presidential polls. Second, reserving elections for minorities may undermine meritocracy.
Third, introducing a provision to ensure minority representation for the presidential office may lead to calls for similar provisions for other offices, such as that of the prime minister or chief justice.
The commission, in its response, said parliamentary elections are different from presidential ones. Voters choose MPs partly because of the plans of the candidates' political parties, but assess presidential hopefuls purely on their individual merits.
Also, the meritocracy argument loses much of its force if the eligibility criteria is not lowered for minority candidates, the report said.
""The commission firmly believes that the eligibility criteria should not be compromised.""
The office of the president is also unique and not comparable to that of the prime minister, chief justice or Speaker of Parliament, it said. None of these is a personification of the state, or a symbol of national unity, in the way the president is.
Therefore, a safeguard is justified for the elected presidency but not for any other office, the report said.

","   The Constitutional Commission's long-awaited report on the elected presidency is an important development in efforts to maintain and strengthen Singapore's unity, racial harmony and stability, and, in the long run, to portray the multiracialism that has become part of Singapore's national identity.
Among the main components of the report is the recommendation to introduce safeguards in the elected presidency to ensure that the highest office in this land ""is not only accessible, but is seen to be accessible"" by the minority Malay and Indian races.
The implementation of the elected presidency in 1993 was supported by the Malay community because of its good intentions - to protect the nation's reserves and assets from a government that spends as it pleases, and to maintain the meritocracy and equality of the public service as well as to prevent nepotism and politically motivated appointments to high offices.
But at the same time, it raised questions in the Malay community about whether or not there would be a Malay president after the late Mr Yusof Ishak. This was not because of the difficulty in finding a Malay candidate who met the qualifying criteria that had been set, but due to the ""effect of race"" that can influence the results of an election.
The fact is that Singapore has not achieved its goal of becoming a race-blind society.
In this matter, credit should be given to the founding prime minister, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. As the President is ""a symbol of national unity"", he emphasised the importance of rotating the office among the main races in Singapore. He said that ""the convention of rotating the presidency among the races was important to remind Singaporeans that their country was multiracial"".
In fact, after two Chinese became president consecutively (the late Mr Wee Kim Wee and the first elected President, the late Mr Ong Teng Cheong), Mr Lee said that it was important for the next president to be from a minority race.
""It is time to remind Singaporeans to have a symbol as a multiracial society, an expression of our national identity,"" he said.
Emphasising the importance of having a provision for minority races to hold the position of President, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that it was so that ""the people can see that yes, this is my country... people like me can become the head of state, can represent the country"".
The commission also acknowledged that because of the importance of the symbolic role played by the President, the minority races cannot be regarded or regard themselves as unable to attain this position. The commission also said this is important for the policy of multiracialism.
Certainly, there were concerns raised over the pros and cons of having a special provision for the position of the President to be held by members of minority races from time to time. The Malay community itself does not want the position to be ""given"" to a Malay as a token to show equality. This concern can be understood and is welcomed as this shows that the principle of meritocracy is accepted by Singaporeans, and in fact is firmly embedded in the minds as well as the belief of Singaporeans.
In this matter, the commission emphasised that the qualifying criteria will not be compromised even if the presidency is held by a minority and this shows that there is no issue of tokenism.
The same qualifying criteria apply to all candidates, which means that whether Singapore has a Chinese, Indian or Malay president, all of them are selected because they are the best person for the position.
This also means that not everyone can meet the high qualifying criteria. Certainly this is so, if we want the best candidate. Therefore, our minds should not be disturbed by other matters, including the fact that some people may not be able to run for this position as they do not meet the stringent requirements.
What is more important is that the Malays should make greater efforts to achieve greater progress which will help increase the number of eligible Malays to be elected as President even without a special provision set for the minority communities.
The Malay community should not worry about whether or not there are Malays who meet the high qualifying criteria. In fact, PM Lee is confident that there are members of the minority communities who are eligible to be elected as the President of Singapore, although he admitted that the number is not as big as that of Chinese candidates. And, he is confident that the number will increase in the future with great progress achieved by the minority communities, including the Malays.
Therefore, what is more important is that the Malays should make greater efforts to achieve greater progress which will help increase the number of eligible Malays to be elected as President even without a special provision set for the minority communities.
This clearly shows that the Constitutional Commission is taking care of the interests of the Malays, as far as the post of President is concerned, through its recommendations. It is of great relief that the Government is concerned about all the races in Singapore and strives to ensure that every Singaporean has a place in Singapore, including to hold the highest office in the land.
However, the proposed changes need the full support not only from the minority ethnic groups but also the majority ethnic group. This is important to maintain harmony, stability and unity in Singapore.

","   I welcome changes to the law to guarantee that ethnic minorities are elected as president from time to time (""PM hints at provision for minority elected president"", Monday; and ""Elected presidency: Proposed changes may be at odds with spirit of meritocracy"" by Mr Seah Yam Meng, Forum Online, Tuesday).
What our society needs now is a system that does not just ""promote equality"" but also truly advances it.
Meritocracy is a value system that has governed how Singapore has elected its leaders for many years. By definition, this system requires one to disregard race, religion, values and social status.
However, it has been found that Singaporeans still hold a certain preference towards political candidates of their own race (""Singaporeans respect all races, but racism still an issue: Survey""; Aug 20).
Given that a minority candidate would start off at a disadvantage when pitted against a candidate from the majority race, by virtue of numbers, such provisions to guarantee that a minority candidate is elected from time to time are targeted and timely.
By ensuring that the position that represents all Singaporeans - regardless of race, language, religion or place of origin - is periodically occupied by a candidate who understands the unique challenges faced by minority races, we are making sure that our society remains firmly grounded in our founding value of multiracialism.
Since the sentiments of the voting population are unlikely to change in the coming decade, the choice lies between upholding meritocracy or ensuring that our leaders reflect the values which bond and strengthen our country.
Such a change to the system does not underestimate the rationality or maturity of Singaporeans at the ballot box; rather, it is the rational and necessary measure that will carry Singapore further in our pursuit of equality in representation.
However, it is better if Singapore can see an elected minority president or prime minister without such provisions in place.
Thus, I encourage all Singaporeans to move beyond automatically preferring leaders of their own race to carefully considering each candidate's ability and merit in relation to others.
It is one thing to tout the fact that our society is largely meritocratic; quite another to actually demonstrate that in our choice of leaders.
While such provisional changes are essential, I anticipate a time in the near future when more Singaporeans recognise the benefit minority leaders can have on the progress of our country in becoming a truly multiracial state.

","   Whether proposed changes to the elected presidency weaken a key institution in Singapore's political system or undermine the nation's basic principles like meritocracy - these were the thrust of many questions raised by community leaders at a two-hour dialogue yesterday.
But Law Minister K. Shanmugam said the Government makes tweaks to the system that it feels are in the best interest of Singapore and Singaporeans, even if the changes invite criticism from some quarters.
He cited the Group Representation Constituency system, which was introduced in 1988 to guarantee minority representation in Parliament.
The Government of the day faced severe criticism, especially from minority community leaders, Mr Shanmugam recalled.
""Many of the Malay and Indian MPs didn't want it. They said it is not good, people will say that we are being carried by the Chinese candidates, that we can't be elected on our own.
ROTATION SIGNIFICANT
It's important to me that the presidency is rotated among the races... Also that the Government takes a closer look at race categories in the future. This is close to my heart as my sons are mixed, and whether they identify as Chinese or Malay, these things will become more prevalent in the future.
MS SRI ZURAIDA ZAINAL ABIDIN, 41, canteen stall operator.
BETTER GAUGE OF CHARACTER
We need to ensure whoever becomes president has good character, but that is very difficult to legislate. The updated criteria are the best way to have a stronger measure of character.
MS LYNNE POH, 38, coffee shop operator.
""But Mr Lee Kuan Yew realised that in the end, in some things like this, race becomes relevant - in a straight fight, race does matter,"" he said, referring to Singapore's founding Prime Minister.
But the GRC system has proved to work as it has been used honestly and in good faith, he said, in response to a question on whether trying to imbue respect and integrity in the elected presidency is an elusive process given the proposed reserved election.
""Today, some ministers are minorities: I anchor my constituency, nobody says I'm being carried by someone else,"" said Mr Shanmugam.
A reserved election is for a particular race which has not had an elected president for five terms or 30 years.
Last night's panel, which included Senior Minister of State (Defence and Foreign Affairs) and South East District Mayor Maliki Osman, was also asked whether the proposed changes would lead to an erosion in meritocracy.
No, said Mr Shanmugam, who noted that in the past, when the president was appointed, the office was rotated among the different races.
In the event of a reserved race, the candidates must still meet the eligibility criteria.
The panel was also asked if the proposed changes are aimed at locking out potential candidates that the Government dislikes.
Mr Shanmugam said the ""key thing"" is to leave aside the individual and ask whether the system needs to be evaluated regularly and kept relevant.
""Do we, as a Government, do what is right based on the system, or do we worry, well, some people are going to say, this is to knock out people we don't like?"" he asked the audience of about 300 grassroots and community leaders.
The current criteria mean more than 1,000 private sector individuals qualify as candidates. It is not possible to ensure all will still qualify when the bar is raised, he added.
Asked why the Government wanted to retain the three-year, instead of six-year, qualifying tenure for private sector candidates, Mr Shanmugam said the Government felt a six-year qualifying period that falls within the last 15 years may exclude otherwise qualified individuals.
SIM University economist Walter Theseira said the Government was probably aware that overly stringent criteria will place too much emphasis on the custodial powers and have the unintended effect of excluding individuals who have the qualities to play the unifying role of the president.
Also, if only one candidate qualifies to run, it reduces the legitimacy of the elected president, he added.
Dr Norshahril Saat of the Iseas - Yusof Ishak Institute said the Government did not accept all the recommendations for raising the eligibility criteria because it wanted to strike a balance between maintaining high standards and ensuring there are enough people who qualify for the job.
""You want to ensure high standards so that the position is given to someone who can manage the technical requirements of the position, but not too much that you shrink the pool of those who qualify,"" he said.

","   The Constitutional Commission's proposal to guarantee a minority president from time to time strikes an ""appropriate balance"" between working towards the ideal of multiracialism and ensuring minorities are represented in the meantime, the Government said yesterday.
The ""hiatus-triggered"" framework - in which an election is reserved for a particular race if no one from that group has been president for five continuous terms - also gels with Singapore's meritocratic ideals.
This is because the qualifying criteria for presidential candidates remain the same. ""This should negate any perceptions of him being a 'token' president,"" the Government said in its White Paper response to the panel's report.
The Government also said that, in accepting the recommendations, it agreed with the commission's reasons for ensuring multiracial representation in the presidency.
The panel had said that the ""ultimate destination"" was one where no safeguards are needed to ensure the representation of different ethnic groups.
Singapore has not ""arrived"" at such a destination yet, it said.
Agreeing, the Government said multiracialism is ""fundamental to Singapore's cohesion and survival"".
It featured prominently in the first Parliament session in 1965 and formed the terms of reference for the first Constitutional Commission a year later, said the White Paper.
The ideal is also entrenched in other social policies, such as education, housing and politics.
For example, the group representation constituencies scheme was introduced in 1988 to ensure minorities are suitably represented in Parliament. ""This has encouraged all political parties to engage in multiracial rather than sectarian politics,"" said the Government.
Noting that countries such as Switzerland and Canada also ensure multiracial representation for their head of state posts, the Government said the nation would ""lose an important element of multiracialism"" if particular minority groups are never represented in the office.
""Every Singaporean has to be able to identify with the president, and to know that a member of his community can and will become president from time to time.""
The Government also cautioned against taking Singapore's multiracial and meritocratic society for granted, as the world is ""seeing a trend of explicitly race-based politics which works up and exploits populist sentiments"".
It added: ""Decencies and sensibilities built up over the years can easily come undone in an age where populism and appeals to racial impulses are increasingly common.""
The White Paper cited Britain's Brexit referendum in June, when debates on immigration policies were widely intertwined with racial arguments.
But at the same time, Singapore has yet to become a ""post-racial"" society, it said, pointing to a recent study that shows that a significant number have a strong preference for presidents or prime ministers to be of their own race.
But the proposed mechanism is race-neutral as it guarantees the representation of all racial groups, the Government said.
It was ""most unlikely"" that the Chinese community would experience a five-term hiatus.
But the move to make sure there is minority representation is ""significant at a symbolic level, as it underscores the importance of ensuring that all races are represented in the presidency"", said the White Paper.

","   Head of state versus custodial role, minority representation and stricter qualifying criteria. The Straits Times roundtable panellists discuss what these mean for the elected presidency and the nation.
When Singapore attained self- government in 1959 and independence in 1965, its head of state and later, president, was a unifying symbol of the multiracial nation.
Just over a quarter-century later, in 1991, changes to the highest office in the land were introduced, giving the president custodial powers over the nation's reserves and in approving key public-sector posts - assets vital to a country with no natural resources to fall back on.
He would also have to be elected.
And now, one year after Singapore celebrated its Golden Jubilee, the Constitution will again be amended significantly, with the widest changes to the elected presidency in its 25 years.
The changes, which the Government outlined in a White Paper published last Thursday, will strengthen the process of candidate selection to ensure men - and women - who stand for election merit the post and can fulfil both key roles well, said a roundtable panel convened last Friday by The Straits Times.
Private-sector candidates must have been the most senior executive in a company with at least $500 million in shareholders' equity, compared to the current $100 million in paid-up capital.Finding good men - and women - who can be president Has the bar been set too high? Reserved races - right direction but will they work? Bring the entrenchment provisions into force sooner?
There will also be a mechanism that ensures candidates from the three main racial groups are represented in the office regularly.
Amendments to the Constitution will be made to strengthen the role of both the initial vetting panel, the Presidential Elections Committee and the Council of Presidential Advisers, as well as to safeguard the institution itself.
But the demands of the historical and custodial roles of the president can be at odds and give rise to potential tension - a point the Government noted in its White Paper.
And finding good men and women who can do the job is a big task, let alone taking the issue of minority representation into consideration, said the roundtable panellists, comprising Minister for Law and Home Affairs K. Shanmugam, Nominated MP Azmoon Ahmad, and academics Gillian Koh and Cheah Wui Ling.
They noted that the process by which the matter was tackled - from the time the review was announced in January and the setting up of a Constitutional Commission that called for public submissions and had hearings, to the publication of the commission's report on Sept 7 - was consultative.
More importantly, it has started a broader conversation about topics that people have been wary of talking about, such as race and representation in the position, said Assistant Professor Cheah of the National University of Singapore Law Faculty.
""There was sufficient time for people to discuss this,"" she said, noting that the commission received more than 100 submissions from the public.
""You can't say that Singaporeans are apathetic. Given the opportunity, they would want to engage, and engage in a constructive manner.""
These engagements shaped the Government's response to the commission's proposals ""quite substantially"", Mr Shanmugam said, noting that it felt the broadest possible representation should be taken into account.
""The process has been good for this matter,"" added the Law Minister, who is leading a series of engagements with grassroots and community leaders on the changes, which the Government will introduce in Parliament next month.
The amendments to the Constitution will then be debated in the House in early November.
The review of the elected presidency itself came in the wake of the hotly contested 2011 presidential election which President Tony Tan Keng Yam won by a narrow margin.
One question that has emerged is whether the changes are aimed at barring certain individuals from contesting the next presidential election, which must be called by August next year.
But Dr Tan Cheng Bock, who came in a close second, himself said in a Facebook post this month: ""We should not jump into conclusion that the whole exercise was to prevent me from running. After all, the people in charge are men of virtue and integrity and would not resort to doing this.""
At recent dialogues, Mr Shanmugam and his colleagues have said the changes seek to improve the system and raise the bar for candidates in tandem with the growth of the economy and the reserves, and are not directed at individuals.
MINORITY REPRESENTATION
Given that the president is a symbol of national unity, there is a need to guarantee minority presidents from time to time. In particular, Singapore has not had a Malay president since its first head of state Yusof Ishak died in office in 1970.
One key recommendation by the commission - the only one the Government accepted in full and that has gained some traction among the public - has been the special provision to guarantee minority representation in the presidency.
This means that if there has not been a president from one of the three main racial groups - Chinese, Malay or Indian and other minority communities - for five continuous terms, or 30 years, the next election will be reserved for members of that group.
One significant aspect is that, unlike the provision for minority MPs to be elected under the Group Representation Constituency system, the commission proposed that this framework be race-neutral.
This means that if, for some reason, there is no Chinese president over five terms, the next election will be reserved for Chi- nese candidates. ""We thought in practical terms that eventuality will never happen and wonder if it was necessary,"" said Mr Shanmugam.
""But when we went round to the various dialogue sessions and to people on the ground, it was quite clear that most people preferred an approach which had a reserved election for all the races if, for example, for five terms a Chinese candidate doesn't get elected. A race-neutral approach in those terms philosophically also makes sense, and so the Government has accepted that.""
He noted that some have also wondered whether five terms was too long. The commission had rejected a model of alternating the presidency between the three racial groups, as this was too obtrusive and fixed.
But the minister added: ""There is nothing to stop candidates from any race standing in any election unless it's a reserved election.""
The accepted framework, he said, acted as a ""circuit breaker"" - a reserved election would kick in only if a candidate from a racial group had not held the office for five terms.
In its White Paper, the Government said this approach ""carefully balances the need for multiracialism with our meritocratic ideals"".
Dr Gillian Koh of the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), who at a commission hearing felt strongly that a president elected in a reserved election might lack gravitas, said she had come round to the idea of a reserved election. She noted that the provision was a fallback one, a ""light touch"" and a ""nudge"" in the direction of multiracialism.
Prof Cheah felt reserved elections help resolve the issue of minorities finding it harder to be elected, but wondered about possible steps that could be taken to tackle underlying issues like voting along racial lines.
FEEDBACK MATTERED
It has been very useful for us literally to speak with these thousands of people and we will continue to do so to understand their viewpoints and to explain these provisions, some of which are very technical. The Government has taken the position that it has, based on feedback over the months, including very important feedback when we tested out some ideas after we received the commission's report. We had a view after looking at the report and, even then, we made some changes after talking to people.
LAW AND HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER K. SHANMUGAM, on how the Government had taken into account feedback from the public.
'FEW MINORITY CANDIDATES'
The fact of the matter is, with the $500 million shareholder equity threshold, we will only be able to find a few candidates among the minority. So the question is, how do we make sure that minorities can still be part of this? Whether we like it
or not, just by statistics, if you take the Malay community, probably not more than 0.5 per cent or 0.2 per cent will meet this requirement... I hope that there will be more Malays coming forward offering themselves in the coming 10 years.
NOMINATED MP AZMOON AHMAD, on whether the more stringent criteria will affect the pool of minority candidates. VIDEO The panel discusses the point on minority representation.
Mr Shanmugam noted that the United States has had close to 2,000 senators in its history, but only nine have been African- American. And 43 per cent of whites voted for US President Barack Obama in 2008, compared to 95 per cent of blacks.
The minister noted that every major community would like to see someone of their race be president. ""These things are primordial. They don't go away,"" he added.
Singapore, he said, took the approach of recognising that differences can be a strength. ""We needed meritocracy as a basic building block, but if meritocracy meant that one or more of the races didn't have a look-in into the system, that wouldn't work either. We had to make sure that everybody prospered within the framework of meritocracy, but you make some adjustments along the way and encourage a lot of self-help.""
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
But a deeper issue, Nominated MP Azmoon Ahmad felt, was that the raised eligibility criteria would narrow further the pool of minority candidates from the private sector, even as it was important to have a sufficient crop of Malay candidates and the same criteria for all.
Dr Koh pointed out that the Government's qualified acceptance of the commission's recommendations - it rejected the suggestion that all candidates must have served for at least six years in a qualifying position, up from three, among others - would still keep the field of eligible contenders wider than the commission proposed.
Mr Shanmugam said that even as the criteria had to be updated, having different criteria for minorities would not be accepted by people, including minorities themselves.
Thus, while the revised criteria means there will be fewer Malay and Indian candidates who would now be eligible, he was confident the pool would grow over time.PANELLISTS

Mr Azmoon asked the minister if he was confident there would be a Malay president elected in an open contest in the next five terms.
""I certainly hope so,"" Mr Shanmugam replied. ""There are qualified Malay candidates. And I think it's up to the community to persuade them to come forward and stand in open elections.""
But the onus must not just fall on minorities, Prof Cheah pointed out.
""It's also incumbent on the majority community to try to overcome the in-group mentality shown in data (from surveys on racial preferences of voters),"" she said.
Indeed, a recent Channel NewsAsia-IPS survey found 59 per cent of Chinese respondents said they would find a Malay president acceptable, the lowest across all groups.
Panellists agreed that it was the obligation of Singaporeans as a whole to overcome such tendencies.
The indications seem promising.
Said Mr Shanmugam: ""What has been heartening in the dialogues is the strong sense of multiracialism and strong sense of meritocracy.""
ELECTED PRESIDENCY SYSTEM Even as the current debate on the changes revolve around two key long-entrenched principles that have stood Singapore in good stead over the past 50 years - multiracialism and meritocracy - the latest changes also move a step closer to making the elected presidency a permanent feature of the system.
A quarter-century has elapsed since the elected presidency was introduced, and the Constitutional Commission called for provisions in the Constitution that entrench the system to either be brought into force, or repealed fully or partly.
Dr Koh found the Government's decision to split these provisions significant: The first tier seeks to safeguard the elected presidency and ""when it's finally set in place, we should have no further arguments about the need for the elected presidency, not even setting aside discussions about whether we should go back to the appointed president"".
The second tier will allow amendments to the custodial powers and other criteria to be made with more flexibility and not require a national referendum on such changes.
Mr Azmoon said he liked this approach: ""There is this provision for changes. We have to make the system adaptable through time.""
As to when the revised provisions will be entrenched, Mr Shanmugam said: ""You want to see how it works and that is something that we can only say after some experience.""
Does he see a return to an appointed president in the future, with the custodial powers devolved as the commission had suggested?
Mr Shanmugam said there was some basis for the commission's views in this area, but ""if you want the president to have the moral authority to say 'No' to the Government, he has to have his independent standing, through elections"".
""But a future government could disagree (on the need for an elected president), and if it disagrees, it can amend the Constitution in the way that is provided,"" he added.
For all the shortcomings of holding elections, which the commission said could prove divisive, panellists recognised the merits of the elected presidency as a unique feature in Singapore's evolving system of governance.
Dr Koh said she sees the elected presidency as an institution that addresses what critics of Sing- apore's government system say it lacks - checks and balances on a dominant party in government.
And it helps safeguard two things that are essential to the Singapore system, she added - the integrity of the public service and key appointments - as well as a key element of the nation's defences: its reserves. ""If the time comes and we face trouble, that's all we've got,"" she said.
The potential for tension between the president's historical and custodial roles notwithstanding, the White Paper notes that all elected presidents have been able to perform both roles with distinction. ""All presidential candidates must aspire towards playing both roles well,"" it adds.
Mr Azmoon agreed, saying ""we must not ever forget"" that the president is a unifier across various segments of society.
Prof Cheah added that the public discussion on the subject had surfaced deeper themes about identity and accountability, and going forward, it is a good thing for people to start thinking about difficult topics and talking about them and, ultimately, reaching out across communities.
Even as the ongoing debate is a reminder that the president must be a unifying figure, it should also give Singaporeans cause to reflect on what they, too, can do for the country to stay united.

","   Are reserved-race presidential elections a clever solution to ensure multiracialism? Or are they something that minority groups themselves may not find all that workable?
At a Straits Times roundtable discussion on changes to the elected presidency last Friday, panellists discussed the pros and cons of the ""hiatus-triggered"" framework.
Under this model, an election is reserved for a particular race if no one from that group has been president for five continuous terms.
On one hand, Institute of Policy Studies deputy director Gillian Koh saw the move as a ""nudge towards multiracialism"".
It would also go hand-in-hand with Singapore's other ideal, meritocracy, as the proposed higher eligibility criteria would apply to all elections.
Dr Koh said she had initially disagreed with the provision, fearing it would lead to heightened race differences but was heartened that the provision is meant to be a fallback.Finding good men - and women - who can be president Has the bar been set too high? Reserved races - right direction but will they work? Bring the entrenchment provisions into force sooner?
""I live with it because it is a five-term hiatus before the provision kicks in,"" she said.
On the other hand, Nominated MP Azmoon Ahmad was concerned that the higher criteria would shrink an already small pool of Malay candidates even further.
His worry was compounded by his observation that of those Malays who are qualified, most would prefer not to put themselves up for election. ""I hope that there will be more Malays coming forward offering themselves (as candidates), maybe in the coming 10 years,"" he said.
Dr Koh concurred, noting a lack of Malay candidates who have put themselves up since the elected presidency scheme was introduced in 1991.
The panel concluded that two things must happen to change this.
First, minority candidates must, well, volunteer.
""We really want to encourage the community to... not be scared and feel that the election process is so churlish because you have to trumpet yourself and offer yourself for the position,"" said Dr Koh.
Second, it is also the responsibility of society to overcome any racial biases it might have. Panellists cited recent surveys that had shown that a significant number of Singaporeans preferred their leaders to be someone from their own race.
Said National University of Singapore assistant law professor Cheah Wui Ling: ""We also have to reach out across community lines... and encourage them to run.""
She wanted the Government to take more active steps, such as in educational policies, to address the problem of voting along racial lines.
Law Minister K. Shanmugam agreed that more education would help, but said such biases are part of ""human nature"".
However, Singaporeans have come a long way: ""We must not overstate it. The majority of Singaporeans can look past race.""
He attributed this to the ""practical"" ways that Singapore has dealt with its different races: ""We didn't, like France, ignore the differences and say they didn't matter. ""
The Group Representation Constituency scheme, introduced in 1988 to ensure minority representation in Parliament, is one example.
Despite the minority requirement, the principle of meritocracy has not been undermined.
He said: ""Today, when people look at a Malay MP or an Indian MP, they don't say, 'Oh, he's there because of his race'.""

"," Race relations; Politics; Perceptions; Presidential elections
","   The debate about the elected presidency (EP) is driven not just by politics and the law, but by perceptions, values and notions of fairness. Policymakers and the public need to engage on these for fruitful discussions.
The passion in the public discussion on the proposed changes to the elected presidency is palpable. This is not surprising as the issues involve multiracialism and meritocracy, which are core principles that Singapore upholds as a society.
Next month, the Government will table a Bill that encompasses changes to the elected presidency. Parliament will debate the Bill during its second reading in November.
How should policymakers and the public approach the discussions in the next two months? Here are my suggestions on ways to make a positive difference in the discourse:
PERCEPTIONS
First, we must remember that perceptions matter. We need to recognise that issues relating to the elected presidency are complex because they are interrelated. A decision on an issue can lead to benefits and positive multiplier effects, or unintended negative consequences.
The fact (or perception) that many issues are intertwined makes it difficult to look at the issue through a single lens and to evaluate the arguments for or against a proposed change or position. Instead, we must understand that people's views on the issues are likely to be affected by human psychological processes.
Discussions on the elected presidency are not just political or legal in nature, but are social and emotional as well. After all, the presidency is an institution that is meant to symbolise the unity of the nation. When an institution (and a person) is invested with such values and aspirations, it is not surprising that debate about changes to it can become heated.
Policymakers and citizens alike must thus realise that people may be unduly influenced by what is salient at the moment, such as a sound bite in the media. They may focus on the immediate past and imminent future, such as the previous presidential election and the next, rather than longer timeframes. They may also make inferences based on what the changes mean for specific individuals and concrete cases, rather than consider more abstract issues, such as how the changes will affect the system of governance or future changes in government.
And it is human to selectively seek out information and interpret it in a way to support preconceived ideas.
So for the public and policymakers alike, it is important to discuss issues frankly and keep an open mind.
Singaporeans - both the people and the Government - aspire to, and demand, a high standard of integrity in public and political service. This explains why one proposed change is for potential presidential candidates to have their character and reputation assessed more stringently by the Presidential Elections Committee. This proposal is based on the value of integrity. It complements the other proposals to raise the eligibility criteria relating to financial and executive management which, while relevant to technical competence and ability, may not predict integrity.
SOCIAL HARMONY
Second, social harmony must be kept paramount in discussions on the elected presidency. Social harmony has always been a shared value underlying Singapore's efforts to address differences, especially when multiracial issues are involved. It should guide how changes to the elected presidency are reviewed and discussed, and how differences in views are expressed and managed.
For the public and policymakers, social harmony should be a key consideration when they decide, if and when, to advocate a position, support a policy option or implement it. This is most relevant when there are reasons to believe that the positions or policy options have a risk of negatively affecting race relations and social cohesion.
Threats to cohesion occur when policies or public actions send signals - sometimes unintentionally - that one race is assumed inferior or unfairly advantaged as compared to another.
This leads to intergroup suspicion, tension and misunderstanding. There may also be negative individual or community effects on beliefs about perceived efficacy and self or public image. All these may eventually result in conflict, or civic and political disengagement.
When the shared value of social harmony is salient, individuals, groups and policymakers have a common and constructive basis to discuss issues of individualism versus collectivism, and group versus national interests.
Social harmony is especially relevant when discussing the need for a reserved election for a particular race and how the ""hiatus-triggered"" provision is consistent with Singapore's multiracialism and meritocratic ideals, or not.
Racial communities in Singapore have been living in harmony and in a way that is consistent with both multiracialism and meritocracy simultaneously. This precious societal asset that enables social cohesion must be preserved.
Like interpersonal trust and trust in government, social cohesion is difficult to build but easy to lose, and, once lost, is difficult to restore. We should appreciate why people are anxious about the proposal to reserve an election for a race if no person of that race has been president after five continuous terms, and encourage honest discussions and seriously consider how the reserved election compares with alternative options.
In this way, people from all communities can be assured and will express their concerns honestly. Sensitive issues that need to be surfaced will not be self-suppressed out of fear of alleged racism.
FAIRNESS
Third, we must understand that people will assess the proposed elected presidency changes according to whether they think the changes are fair. As I wrote in a previous article, people perceive fairness on four dimensions: outcomes, processes, performance and access to opportunities.
Changes to the elected presidency will be seen by citizens as fair if:
- It results in an outcome where capable candidates with integrity are deemed eligible to contest, and the contest produces a president with capability and integrity.
- If the process to determine eligible candidates has clear and objective criteria, and they are consistently applied.
- If citizens can see that those who perform well are rewarded, based on objective assessment.
- If citizens can see that everyone eligible has equal access to the contest. The consideration here is whether the access is unduly decreased, or increased, because of group membership or societal situations beyond the individual's control, and independent of effort and true potential.
In other words, people will assess the proposed changes to the elected presidency based on whether they provide an objective means of evaluating a potential candidate, and whether they think the changes hobble some individuals while privileging others.
MOVING FORWARD
Bearing in mind that feelings and perceptions matter, that people want processes to be fair, and social harmony is paramount, how should the parliamentary debate and public discussion proceed?
If social harmony is paramount, then we must make sure that political scapegoating and squabbles do not dominate the discourse. Such rhetoric may be entertaining but the impact can be adverse. It will not only create confusion but also cause cynicism. It can even divide Singapore society and threaten the cohesion built up over the years.
Everyone contributing to the discussion should be constructive. The following are some concrete steps that can shed light in the heat of passionate debate.
- Get the facts right and make them clear. Verify claims. Identify false beliefs, and dispel myths and misinformation. Explicate and emphasise the facts. Start by reading the government White Paper.
- Distinguish between laws and values. What is not illegal and what can be passed as laws may not always coincide with what is acceptable by people socially or psychologically, or what they consider morally right or fair.
- See things from another's perspective because feelings and perceptions matter. Find out from the various communities what is important or acceptable to them, what they think, how they feel and when they would or would not do something. Ask to find out their concerns and circumstances. Never just assume and attribute.
- When making judgments on potential policy outcomes and the psychological impact on people, distinguish between theory and practice. When something is theoretically possible, consider the extent to which it is practically plausible. Good science, context-sensitivity and representative feedback from the people are critical here.
- Frankly discuss implications of policy options and consider how likely they are to achieve the intended national goals or result in unintended negative consequences. In the light of new information or circumstances, have the intellectual honesty and political courage to change one's current position.
If all parties take a constructive approach when considering the proposed changes to the elected presidency, it is possible to evolve a system of governance that benefits Singapore and Singaporeans.The writer is director of the Behavioural Sciences Institute, Lee Kuan Yew Fellow and professor of psychology at the Singapore Management University.

303,"Why the gap in views? A 2011 survey by the Institute of Policy Studies after the presidential election found that 85 per cent of the 2,000 Singaporeans surveyed agreed that a president from a minority community could be elected through the existing system.

","   A recent survey of over 2,600 Singaporeans by market research agency Blackbox found that only 23 per cent thought it was ""absolutely necessary"" to improve the elected presidency (EP) system to ensure that minorities are given greater opportunity to become president.
Around half (48 per cent) thought it was ""good to have"" and 29 per cent thought it ""not necessary"".
In contrast, over half (53 per cent) thought it was ""absolutely necessary"" to improve the EP via the introduction of tougher checks and balances to restrict the Government's ability to spend Singapore's reserves. Only 5 per cent thought this ""not necessary"".
These findings, released by Blackbox on Sept 16 on its website, suggest a disjuncture in views between the Government and Singaporeans. The Government, in releasing a White Paper on the elected presidency on Sept 15 , agreed with recommendations by a Constitutional Commission that there should be reserved elections to safeguard minority representation in the EP. This will kick in if one of Singapore's constituent racial groups has not been represented in the presidential office after five continuous terms. Why the gap in views? A 2011 survey by the Institute of Policy Studies after the presidential election found that 85 per cent of the 2,000 Singaporeans surveyed agreed that a president from a minority community could be elected through the existing system.
This confidence indicates several beliefs which we have routinely noted in our research: We aspire to be multicultural and we believe that as a society, we have become race-blind. We also strongly endorse the principles of meritocracy and believe that success is independent of race in Singapore, especially since we have seen people of all races succeeding. As such, we are uncomfortable with policies that might favour individuals because of their racial background.
TOO SOON TO CELEBRATE?
In reality, much of our multiracial harmony has come through the careful management of our differences. Despite the nostalgia that some have of pre-independence Singapore, where communities supposedly lived with great levels of cohesion, the reality is that there were many tense moments in our race relations which sometimes culminated in violence. Even in present times, while we espouse multiculturalism, many of us hold on to prejudices and some of us experience racism, as seen in the Channel NewsAsia-Institute of Policy Studies (CNA-IPS) survey on race relations, released last month.
History has shown that policies to proactively manage diversity are often contentious. When the motion was tabled in 1989 to have ethnic quotas in public housing, there was substantial opposition that these policies would affect the natural processes of housing sales, impact housing prices and disadvantage minorities. Today, few argue that this policy is detrimental. There are even calls for this policy to be extended to ensure there are no enclaves even in the private housing system.
In the same vein, there was robust argument against the group representation constituency system when it was first proposed in the late 1980s, with some charging that the system was politically motivated to support the ruling party. But 68 per cent of the 2,000 respondents in the CNA-IPS survey agreed that this policy safeguards minority rights, with 7 per cent disagreeing and the rest indicating that they were not sure.
MULTIRACIAL REPRESENTATION AND MERITOCRACY
Singapore's Government is not only expected to ensure that the nation's meritocratic system functions, it also has to work to preserve the harmony of this multiracial society. For the latter to be in place, it is crucial that the Government ensures minority representation, especially in public institutions closely related to Singapore's practice of multiracialism. This is something that at present seems more important to minority communities compared to the majority Chinese population. Over half of minority respondents (52 per cent) in the Blackbox survey said it was ""absolutely necessary"" to ensure that minorities are given greater opportunity to become president, compared to 14 per cent of Chinese Singaporeans.
Singapore's Government is not only expected to ensure that the nation's meritocratic system functions, it also has to work to preserve the harmony of this multiracial society. For the latter to be in place, it is crucial that the Government ensures minority representation in public institutions.
But I expect Singaporeans across races will recognise that we have not had a Malay president for the last 46 years since Mr Yusof Ishak died in office in 1970. This is a gap in our portrayal of multiracialism, a matter which should not be treated lightly because of the symbolic nature of the presidency.
How Singapore ensures that we obtain an elected president of the minority races from time to time might require a mechanism to compensate for the race-based preferences which are still part of our society. The White Paper on the elected presidency calls for what some have deemed as affirmative action, as it agrees with holding a reserved election to ensure such minority representation.
Yes, the value of affirmative action has been called into question but I would venture to say that it is more problematic when it is applied to level up an entire group, rather than being used as a safeguard. As the case of African-American students in the United States has shown, pushing students who do not fare as well academically into top Ivy League schools might result in some simply not being able to cope with the demands of such competitive educational settings.
The mechanism that the Government's White Paper supports is different. It will not lower the bar for minority candidates - the same exacting standards will be required for all who want to be elected as president, regardless of race. The reserved election serves to eliminate the possibility that racial biases may disadvantage minorities who are exceptionally qualified for the presidency.
For minority Singaporeans, the fact that the highest office in the land can be occupied by a fellow minority, even if it requires some modification to our system, symbolises the broader priorities of the nation to include them. Thus, I hope that the next presidential election will be reserved for candidates from the Malay community. It would be logical to begin counting the five terms - since the reserved election provision kicks in if there is no president from a particular racial group after five terms - from 1991 when the EP scheme began with President Wee Kim Wee exercising the EP's new custodial powers.
Singapore's practice of meritocracy cannot merely be based on the realisation of the principle but should support the broader goals of ensuring an equitable and harmonious social system. Multiracial representation is a fundamental component of such a system.
It is high time that we have a Malay president in multiracial Singapore.The writer is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies, National University of Singapore.

","   I support Dr Patrick Liew Siow Gian's suggestions on improving financial literacy among senior citizens, and educating them on retirement planning (""Extend helping hand, not handouts, to retirees""; Sept 19).
However, it seems that his views on the necessity of state-assisted retirement are divorced from the reality of the situation.
Foremost, I contest his characterisation of retirement as a concept.
Humans are not economic tools to be used until they are fully exhausted. It is imperative that the option of withdrawing from work in old age remains viable; not doing so would be an affront to human dignity.
The rest of his argument is premised on the assumption that ""there are no clear success stories"" of state-sponsored retirement funds ""to act as models for the rest of the world"".
Notwithstanding the fact that Singapore's Central Provident Fund already provides a promising case study, let us examine nations that have implemented generous welfare and pension programmes, such as the Nordic countries.
In the Global Competitiveness Report 2015-2016, Norway, Finland, Sweden and Denmark all ranked within the top 15 worldwide. This indicates that workforce participation, productivity and a strong work ethic are still very much present despite the availability of government handouts.
This disproves the assertions that retirement benefits would ""erode our work ethos and fighting spirit"", or that the taxation needed to support the scheme would make it harder for businesses to ""compete with their counterparts overseas"".
Moreover, these countries, especially Norway, have successfully used sovereign wealth funds and strategic investments to sustain their pension schemes, even in the face of an ageing population. This is not dissimilar to how Singapore's CPF Board manages and grows citizens' contributions.
This, again, contrasts with the argument that states are having difficulty financing retirement funds.
Most importantly, it must be recognised that ""people's attitude, knowledge and skills"" are not, in themselves, sufficient to guarantee an acceptable standard of living in retirement.
In my previous letter (""Don't miss out on life's best chapter""; Sept 7), I stressed that meritocracy and proportionate reward for work do not always hold true. Hard-working and well-prepared individuals can be - and often are - unfairly punished by the vicissitudes of fate.
For these individuals who slip through the cracks, state assistance is not just desirable, but essential.

","   Should Singapore's city centre have Housing Board flats? If a city's core is where one finds its pulse and essence, should it include HDB flats, since HDB living - a quintessential Singaporean experience - is a vital piece of the social fabric?
This question resurfaced recently in the context of the discussion on having more HDB flats in the central area, such as at the Greater Southern Waterfront that extends from Labrador Park to Marina South, south of Tanjong Pagar.
One concern is the ""lottery effect"" of large price appreciation for such well-located flats, and whether corrective measures such as selling the flats on shorter leases, or permitting resale only after more than the current five years, could work to create a more equitable system.
The central area has had HDB flats since the 1960s, such as in Chinatown. In the 1980s, central area land was thought to be too expensive for public housing, and should be reserved for commercial use. By then, it was becoming less of a disadvantage to live farther from the city, with the upcoming Mass Rapid Transit rail network.
Since then, other than Pinnacle@Duxton, no new HDB flats have been built in the central area. HDB flats in areas like Outram Park were acquired under the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme or demolished.
Meanwhile, in heritage areas like Tiong Bahru, higher-income residents and hip shops displaced traditional occupants and trades.
For reasons of diversity and inclusiveness, it is desirable to provide more public housing in city centre areas. How this can be done deserves further study, including the planning model for such housing, which could be in smaller precincts rather than a whole town, as well as details such as possible measures to manage ""windfall"" resale gains.
With plans now under way for a new downtown, the time is ripe for serious discussion on whether, and how, to inject public housing into the central area.
After all, the city centre, as Singapore's historical and symbolic heart, must resonate in meaningful ways with everyone.
Confining new HDB estates only to outlying areas, while planning a glittering array of architectural gems, luxury residences and consumer offerings for the well-heeled in the central area could make segments of the population feel left out.
Harvard sociologist Robert Putnam argued, in a 2007 study, that diverse communities are well worth the effort to nurture for their contribution to ""social capital"" (the people networks that make a society function). This is so, although such communities may need to overcome initial short-term mistrust and fragmentation.
Socio-economic diversity has three main advantages. First, diversity promotes inclusiveness, variety and vibrancy. Singapore's hawker centres are socially important because they serve people of all incomes. Cities with offerings for a range of diverse consumers with varied lifestyles and tastes along the same streets draw more people outdoors, make neighbourhoods and the whole city more lively and inviting, and encourage business innovation and entrepreneurship.
Singapore's diverse-use, mixed-income neighbourhoods such as Holland Village and Marine Parade are regarded as highly liveable. Such communities are sought after by what urban studies theorist Richard Florida calls ""the creative class"" - designers, researchers, entrepreneurs and innovators who increasingly drive economic development.
Second, diversity enhances social mobility and spatial justice, which is the concept of how socially valuable resources like hospitals or parks are spread across different parts of a city or region by providing fairer access to areas with better amenities, jobs, schools and networks.
Mixed-income communities are an important pillar of a comprehensive meritocracy with high social mobility. Delivering the 2013 S. Rajaratnam Lecture, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam noted that upward mobility was stronger in mixed-income areas with more two-parent families, better schools and civic engagement.
Third, diversity fosters social cohesion, trust and resilience, rather than just mutual accommodation and co-existence between income groups. If wealthier and lower-income households lead increasingly separate lives, negative perceptions may be sharpened. But contact with different ethnic or income groups in a person's social environment - such as shared experiences at the local food centre, grocery or the playground - promotes more balanced perceptions of others.
Here, everyday encounters of neighbourliness act as a social leveller for residents, familiar strangers and visitors.
Land markets are not perfect, and market outcomes do not always maximise value to society. Allocating land parcels only to the highest bidders may not be ideal if only office skyscraper developments are built in the city, leaving it devoid of homes, cafes and recreational facilities. Good urban planning will prevent these outcomes.
For reasons of diversity and inclusiveness, it is desirable to provide more public housing in city centre areas. How this can be done deserves further study, including the planning model for such housing, which could be in smaller precincts rather than a whole town, as well as details such as possible measures to manage ""windfall"" resale gains.
Genuinely diverse, inclusive central area communities would be mixed not only in land use, but also in the range of ethnicities, cultures, demographic and socio-economic groups and occupations they host.
This can increase distinctiveness and vibrancy, reinforce a more equitable and inclusive society, and support the meritocracy and social mobility fundamental to Singapore's continued progress.
Singapore is a global city, but - unlike New York, London or Tokyo - it is also a country and nation.
If done well, including more slices of the HDB way of life into the central area could help enhance the tangible, psychological stake Singapore residents have in their country.
Greenfield central area sites, such as the Greater Southern Waterfront after port activities relocate to Tuas, present opportunities to make a big difference to the nature of the city core and to society as a whole.Wu Wei Neng and Louisa-May Khoo are researchers at the Centre for Liveable Cities

","   Parliament began debating proposed changes to the elected presidency yesterday, and a strong focus was on how best to ensure all races have a chance to be represented in the office from time to time.
The changes to the Constitution will also raise the eligibility criteria for candidates, and refine the role of the council advising the president.
Signalling the importance of the changes, President Tony Tan Keng Yam had a message for the House, which Speaker Halimah Yacob read out at the start of the debate.
The changes are based largely on the recommendations of a Constitutional Commission, whose report was released in September and which the Government broadly accepted.
Said Dr Tan: ""The objectives of the review are clear - to ensure that the institution of the elected presidency stays relevant with time and our local context, and that the Singapore Constitution as a living document is aptly refreshed.""
He added that the president is a symbol of the nation's unity and the office must uphold Singapore's multiracialism. It was thus not a coincidence that Singapore's first four appointed presidents - Mr Yusof Ishak, Dr Benjamin Sheares, Mr Devan Nair and Dr Wee Kim Wee - represented, in turn, the Malay, Eurasian, Indian and Chinese communities respectively, he said.
But after the elected presidency was instituted, all but one of the elected presidents have been Chinese, including himself, he noted.
""Our long-term aspiration should be for minorities to be elected into the office without the need for any intervention,"" said Dr Tan.
""But we also need to recognise the current realities.""
Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, in his 90-minute speech setting out the Government's case for the proposed changes, also noted that the presidency has lacked a way to ensure minorities are represented in the office since it was transformed from an appointed position to an elected one in 1991.
Thus the proposed change to reserve a presidential election for a specific ethnic group, if a member of that group has not been elected after five terms, was balanced, he said.
""The symbolic role of the presidency has sometimes been overlooked but remains of vital importance,"" said Mr Teo, adding that it is difficult to ensure all races will be represented in direct elections.
Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson), one of three backbenchers to speak yesterday, said while three in four Singaporeans are ethnic Chinese, it is important that the president reflect Singapore's multiracialism.
""Non-Chinese Singaporeans are not a 'by the way'; we are all an integral part of Singapore,"" she said.
Even so, the criteria to qualify to run will not be lowered for any race, said Mr Teo, addressing concerns that special arrangements to ensure multiracial representation in the presidency would be tokenism.
He said: ""Multiracial representation can be achieved while ensuring meritocracy is not compromised.""
It was a dilemma that Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim wrestled with.
In a moving speech, the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs said that segments of the Malay community, ""perceived as an underachieving community"", yearned for a president from one of their own.
There has not been a Malay president for 46 years. But a Malay candidate must meet the same exacting standards as all others, which the changes will ensure, he added.
The debate continues today.

","   While it is nice and timely for Singapore to have a Malay president, the Malay candidate must meet the same exacting standards demanded of candidates from other communities, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim said.
""We do not want, and we cannot accept, tokenism,"" Dr Yaacob told the House yesterday, on the first day of debate on proposed changes to the elected presidency. ""We want a president to command the respect of all Singaporeans,"" he added.
Speaking in English and Malay, Dr Yaacob, who is Communications and Information Minister, sought to explain the psyche and concerns of the Malay community and its historical burden of being perceived as lagging behind other communities.
Describing the issue as an ""emotive one"", Dr Yaacob noted that Singapore has not had a Malay president for 46 years. The last Malay president was Singapore's first president Yusof Ishak, who died in office on Nov 23, 1970.
""An entire generation of Malays have grown up without ever having a Malay president,"" said Dr Yaacob. ""Among the older Malays, having lived under a Malay president, it is understandable that they yearn for one after a very long time.""
Younger Malays who grew up under meritocracy may be a little reluctant to see the change to ensure a Malay president from time to time, yet in closed-door discussions many would raise their hands when asked if they want to see a Malay president, he noted, adding: ""But very few would say this publicly.""
He noted how when the ethnic integration policy for public housing was started in 1989, there was some unease, but today, it has served the national interest, preventing ghettoes and enabling integration.
He himself struggled with it, but recognised the need for such policies ""to avoid the pitfalls of other societies that ignored the human tendency to behave in tribal ways"".
The changes to the presidency are a similar policy tweak, he noted.
""To have a qualified Malay to do the job speaks to a long-held desire among the community to see one of us serving in the highest office in the land. It is about our place in this nation that we call home,"" he said.
Malays, more so than other communities, look forward to seeing the success of one of their own, Dr Yaacob said. He cited the example of Natasha Nabila who topped the Primary School Leaving Examination in 2007 and broke the record for the highest scores. ""The community was overjoyed,"" he said.
Dr Yaacob also shared a personal anecdote about his eldest brother Mohd Ismail Ibrahim, the first Malay President's Scholar. The extended family turned up at Paya Lebar Airport in 1968 to see his brother off for his studies, while a fellow scholar was accompanied only by his immediate family. He said: ""The airport was swamped by Malays! It was a moment of celebration.""
""The truth is that we do not have many Malays in key positions of power and leadership,"" noted Dr Yaacob. ""Having one being a president is not just nice, but timely.""
He added: ""But this cannot, and must not, be the reason why we should have a Malay president.""
Dr Yaacob also said he was concerned the debate was putting minority communities in the spotlight again, a situation the Malay community had frequently been in for the last 50 years. ""We lagged behind in education, (had) higher divorce rates, higher crime rates and, more recently, Islam has been associated with the terrorism threat,"" he said.
The move to ensure a Malay president could be seen as ""the Government going out of its way to help a community that has lagged behind"". This is why for a candidate to be respected by all Singaporeans, he must meet the same high standards, regardless of race, he added.

","   Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday explained why he felt it was his personal responsibility to introduce changes to the elected presidency during the second reading of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill in Parliament. Below is an excerpt from his speech on the changes needed to ensure the presidency remains a multiracial institution.
For the past quarter century since we have implemented the scheme, the elected presidency scheme has worked well and become a valuable part of our political system.
It is a unique system, very difficult to get right, because the balance is a delicate one. A symbolic head of state, but elected through a national ballot with a popular mandate, but not a mandate to govern. He can use his mandate to say no in certain areas but not to push for policies or to initiate action.
The presidential election itself presents some difficulties. In a fiercely contested campaign, emotions build up, and issues that have nothing to do with the role of the president can become hot. Candidates may then make claims, promises and declarations which go beyond the president's powers and competence under the Constitution.
We saw that happen in the 2011 Presidential Election.
But for all these difficulties, I am convinced that the elected president has been a plus for our system. Having this stabiliser is critical and has already made a difference. Even though it is not easy to get right, we should persevere to improve the system.
MULTIRACIALISM
Among all the changes in this complicated Bill, the one which we thought hardest about, and where the most is at stake, is the question of ensuring multiracial representation in the elected presidency.
To raise the qualifying criteria is relatively straightforward because it is an objective bar. To strengthen the CPA (Council of Presidential Advisers ) is a matter of fine-tuning. The provisions on veto and entrenchment are essentially a legal drafting problem, setting the right balance between flexibility and rigidity in the Constitution, but it can be done.
But whether to ensure that people from different races can and do indeed become president is the most difficult question because it goes right to the core of our fundamental belief in a multiracial society.
As the head of state, the president is the symbol of our nation. He represents all Singaporeans. Therefore, the office must be multiracial.
At the same time, whichever ethnic group the president belongs to, he has to be multiracial in his approach. He has to reach out to all races, connect with every Singaporean. Fortunately all our presidents, so far, have done that.
Many of us want to be race-blind. We feel that we ourselves are race-blind. We are understandably uneasy about any suggestion that perhaps we are not so. I am heartened that is our ideal and aspiration but at the same time we have to be realistic about where we are today.
If the president, who is the symbol of a multiracial nation, always comes from the same race, not only will he cease to be a credible symbol of our nation, but the very multi-racial character of the nation will come under question. Every citizen, Chinese, Malay, Indian, or some other race, should know that someone of his community can become president, and in fact from time to time, does become president.
This is not a theoretical matter - for us, race is a very live consideration, with real world implications.
We have made enormous progress in our racial harmony, certainly, but we are not completely there. As a small, open, multiracial country, our ethnic groups are always subject to different external pulls and influences. Our racial harmony can be affected by developments in other countries and this applies to all our ethnic groups.
Take the rise of China, with which we have substantial relations. China's rise is a tremendous plus for Singapore, and for the world. Our companies do a lot of business in China, and many Chinese companies participate in our economy.
We work on government-to- government projects - Suzhou, Tianjin, and now the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative. We have been to-ing and fro-ing intensively - tourism, culture, education.
Every Chinese New Year, without Chinese artisans, we will not have all the lanterns at the Riverside Hong Bao. Every community event, there is some engagement, some flow, some connection, with some part of China which can add some extra colour and vividness to our Singapore Chinese culture. We want to grow this cooperation with China and take full advantage of our familiarity with the culture and language.
Yet, there is a risk. Because of our population composition and cultural familiarity, people may misunderstand us to be a Chinese country, and forget that Singapore is an independent sovereign country, cooperating with other countries on the basis of our own national interests and positions.
It can lead to misunderstandings, unrealistic expectations and it can lead to us being carried away, even domestically, and forgetting this fundamental fact about Singapore.
We are not a Chinese country, but a multiracial, multireligious South-east Asian country with an ethnic Chinese majority, but not a Chinese country. We have to show this domestically, to our own population, the Chinese population as well as the non-Chinese population. We have to show this externally to other countries too. So that is one important way in which the external world influences our domestic racial cohesion and considerations.
Secondly, among our closest neighbours, race and religion are hot issues. We look at Indonesia, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, you may know him by another name, Ahok, is running for re-election as governor of Jakarta. Ahok is a Chinese and a Christian. His opponents cited a Quranic verse to tell Muslims not to vote for Ahok. They called him a ""kafir"", an infidel, a strong word. Ahok responded in a YouTube video and accused them of lying and misinterpreting the Quran. Then they attacked Ahok for blasphemy. Ahok was forced to apologise but his opponents staged a huge demonstration in Jakarta last Friday. The protesters yelled ""We want a Muslim governor!"" and ""Burn Ahok!"" There was violence and rioting. They (the police) are investigating whether he committed blasphemy.
In Malaysia, politics is based on race and religion. It is the antithesis of the way politics is conducted in Singapore. Political Islam is a dominant feature. PAS (Parti Islam Se-Malaysia) has tabled a hudud Bill in Parliament. The Barisan Nasional government has allowed it to be put on the order paper. Non-Muslim parties are deeply upset about this, but they know that in such matters, they do not decide. The divide between the races is very deep.
In Singapore, we worry about race and religion ourselves too. What will happen to our society if we have a terrorist attack? What more if the attack is by a Singaporean, self-radicalised after visiting extremist websites? Will we stand together, or will we split along racial and religious lines? A terrorist attack is frightening but if it comes from outside, I think it is not so hard to understand, we pull together. If it should come from within, are we sure that we can heal back together so easily, unless we work very hard at it before the fact? These external events and influences will affect our social cohesion.
We are building a radically different society in Singapore than other countries in the region. We are seeking to be multiracial, equal and harmonious. Gradually enlarging our shared Singaporean identity, while celebrating our different cultures and faiths. Allowing minority communities ample space to live their own ways of life, never forcing everybody to conform to a single norm set by the majority. We have to work consciously and systematically at this. It will not happen by itself, nor will we get there if we blithely assume that we have already arrived and do not talk about it, do not do anything about it, and we are okay. That is not the way to be okay.
The president is the most important unifying symbol of the nation. Singaporeans look up to the president as the personification of all that Singapore stands for and all that we stand for in Singapore. So it is a fundamental necessity that the presidency be multiracial.
If we do not make deliberate arrangements to ensure a multiracial outcome, the presidency could well become a single-race office because minorities do find it harder to win in a national election.
NOT AN EASY SUBJECT
This is not an easy subject to speak about openly. Many of us want to be race-blind. We feel that we ourselves are race-blind. We are understandably uneasy about any suggestion that perhaps we are not so. I am heartened that is our ideal and aspiration but at the same time we have to be realistic about where we are today.
You have seen the surveys. They show that at least a significant minority of Singaporeans consider race as a factor when they vote, and will not vote for somebody of a different race to be president.
That puts the minority candidates at a disadvantage in an election.
Mr Murali (Pillai) spoke about this yesterday, and he knows this from personal experience. I knew this when I sent Mr Murali to Bukit Batok to fight a by-election in an SMC (single member constituency), knowing that it is not so easy for a non-Chinese to do that. I did it because he knew the ground, I knew him, and I judged that this was a risk that I was prepared to take. He fought hard, he won, but he can tell you, and I can tell you, that he had to fight harder than if I had sent a similar Chinese candidate familiar with the ground to go and fight and win. It is a reality of Singapore society and Singapore politics.
It is not just Singapore. This is so in every country, including the US. In 1992, when Bill Clinton first stood for president, he ran against George H.W. Bush, the senior George Bush. The blacks voted for Bill Clinton. Toni Morrison, who is a black female Nobel laureate for Literature, described Bill Clinton rapturously as ""the first black president"".
Years later in 2008, Hillary Clinton, his wife, ran against Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination in the primaries. Bill Clinton repeated this phrase and described himself as ""the first black president"", to shore up Hillary. He thought it would help. Instead, he caused an uproar in the African-American community. The blacks voted overwhelmingly against Hillary, for Obama.
Then Obama became president. It was a real breakthrough for African Americans. People said marvellous - race no longer matters in US politics, but they were too optimistic.
After eight years of a black president, in the current election you have two white candidates, Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump. What is the election about? At one level, it is about globalisation, jobs, insecurity, but on another level, race is front and centre. Trump supporters are overwhelmingly white, lower- and middle-income voters. They feel threatened by the demographic changes happening in America. Theirs is a white protest vote.
The moral of the story is that race and religion are very deep-seated realities in every country. We must take them very seriously. So even though there is no pressure, and the minority communities have not pressed for it, we should make arrangements now, to ensure that the presidency will be multiracial.
RESERVED ELECTION FOR MINORITIES
We have decided to do this through what the Constitutional Commission has called the hiatus-triggered model, which means that presidential elections are generally open to candidates of all races, but if we have not had a president from a particular community for five consecutive terms, then the next term will be reserved for candidates from that community.
If one of them is elected, we will have a president from that community. This means that in the course of six presidential terms, there should be at least one Chinese president, one Malay president, and one president who is either Indian or other minority, provided qualified candidates appear.
Which means that out of six terms, there will be at least two non-Chinese presidents, which means one in three presidents will be non-Chinese, which is bigger than the proportion of non-Chinese in our population. Some people have objected that this arrangement goes against the principle of meritocracy. I understand their concerns, but I would like you to consider two points.
First, the candidate in a reserved election must still meet the same qualifying criteria. He must be competent for the job of wielding the custodial powers. He must be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election.
Secondly, the symbolic role of the president is just as important as his custodial role. As a symbol of the nation, the race of the candidate is relevant. So while individually, a good candidate of any race will be satisfactory, collectively, over a period of time, we need that mix of presidents of different races, and the election mechanism must be designed to produce such a mix over time, and that is what the hiatus-triggered model delivers.
When should the racial provision start counting? The Constitutional Amendment Bill states that the Government should legislate on this point and the Government intends to legislate when we amend the Presidential Elections Act in January next year.
We have taken the Attorney-General's advice. We will start counting from the first president who exercised the powers of the elected president - in other words, Dr Wee Kim Wee. That means we are now in the fifth term of the elected presidency. We will also have to define the ethnic group of each of the elected presidents we have had so far. There is no practical doubt, but as a legal matter we have to define it because you cannot convene the committee retrospectively to certify them.
The Act will deem Dr Wee Kim Wee as Chinese, Mr Ong Teng Cheong as Chinese, Mr S R Nathan, who served two terms, as Indian, and Dr Tony Tan as Chinese.
Therefore by the operation of the hiatus-triggered model, the next election, due next year, will be a reserved election for Malay candidates and that means if a Malay candidate steps up to run, or more than one Malay candidate step up to run, who are qualified, Singapore will have a Malay president again.
As Minister Yaacob Ibrahim observed yesterday, this would be our first after more than 46 years, since our first president, Encik Yusof Ishak. I look forward to this.
These are practical arrangements we must make, in order to make our multiracial system work. We recognise where we are and we will work to strengthen our multi-racial society. Our ideal is to be race-blind. We ""pledge ourselves as one united people, regardless of race, language or religion"", and we must continue striving towards this goal.
As we get closer to this ideal, and minority candidates are regularly elected president in open elections, we will need the hiatus-triggered reserved elections less and less.
WHY NOW?
We have spent a lot of energy and time on the changes to the elected president this year. I personally have paid a lot of attention to this. I feel strongly that this is my responsibility and something that I need to do now.
Let me explain why. I have been involved with the elected presidency almost from the start. As a young minister, I helped Mr Goh Chok Tong and his team develop Mr Lee Kuan Yew's concept into a complete scheme, and I helped Professor (S.) Jayakumar to draft the white papers in 1988 and in 1990.
Since the elected presidency began, I have been operating the mechanism that we designed, and discovering its glitches. I helped to refine and amend the scheme as we went along. And after becoming prime minister, I have worked closely with two elected presidents, Mr S R Nathan and Dr Tony Tan, including asking Mr Nathan for permission to draw on the reserves during the global financial crisis.
So I think I can say that I know the system; what the design intent was, when we first formulated the scheme, how it has worked in practice, how conditions have changed, how our ideas have evolved and how we should fine-tune and improve the scheme, to make it work for our long-term future.
These changes are my responsibility. I am doing it now because it would be irresponsible of me to kick this can down the road and leave the problem to my successors. They have not had this long experience with the system, and will find it much harder to deal with.
I am sure the result will not be perfect. I fully expect that one day, my successors will find it necessary to make further improvements and adjustments to the elected presidency scheme but I believe the changes in this Bill will make the elected presidency work better for Singapore, now and in the future.
But please understand that whatever we do, it is not cast-iron and foolproof - things can still go wrong in Singapore, with Singapore politics. A government may be elected with good intentions, only to find its policies turn out badly. A president may be elected on a basis different from his Constitutional role. Relations between the president and the Government may become strained, or even break down.
Most fundamentally, Singaporeans may become split along fault lines of race, religion, income or class, and then no political system will produce a stable government for the country. All these are possible, despite all the safeguards we put in place and yet we know that without the elected president, we have more cause to worry about things going disastrously wrong.
Strengthening the elected presidency will reduce the chances of this happening but ultimately our safety, and our future, lie in the hands of Singaporeans. We must rely on Singaporeans to remain united so that our politics can be constructive and cohesive. To get people to come forward to serve the nation in many different ways. To elect good people into Parliament and government, and to serve as president, and then we can all work together with those entrusted with authority and responsibility to deliver the results that we know Singapore can achieve.

"," Leaders from the Chinese and Indian communities said they support the move to reserve next year's presidential election for a Malay candidate.
The step will strengthen multiracialism and social stability in Singapore, they added.
The new system will ensure multiracial representation in the highest office in the land, the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations told The Straits Times.
This is vital to safeguard Singapore's identity as a multiracial and harmonious society, said the national umbrella body that represents more than 200 Chinese clans and associations here.
""We urge all Singaporeans to support this new proposal, which would ensure that presidential elections remain current and relevant to our society,"" it added.
Yesterday, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry issued a joint reply to The Straits Times .
""Meritocracy and multiracialism are the two key cornerstones of Singapore's success,"" said the chambers. ""Social and racial stability is important to businesses and must be maintained. This allows businesses to plan ahead without worry, and adjust with ease. Businesses value a stable and predictable political system that is conducive in creating a pro-business environment to operate in.""
The development does not surprise Mr Tan Aik Hock, president of the Singapore Lam Ann Association. ""It is timely,"" said the clan association leader. ""The Malay community has not had a president since Mr Yusof Ishak.
""Chinese Singaporeans will understand the reasons behind the move. It is part of being inclusive because we are a Chinese-majority society,"" he added.
Dr R. Theyvendran, president of the Singapore Ceylon Tamils Association, said the Indian community supports the move too, noting: ""We have (had) two Indian presidents, so the Indian community is already represented and in a strong position.
""And this is a very fair system,"" he added. ""Eventually, there will be another Indian president in the future.""

","   Institutions which uphold single objectives enjoy an easier existence than those with multiple key goals. The president as a symbol of unity would be a relatively uncontroversial part of Singapore's polity. But when it falls on the president, as someone who can rise above the political fray, to also preserve the national reserves and the integrity of key civil service appointments, the picture can get complex. This is because an apolitical role has to sit alongside roles which run the risk of politicisation. A further complication arises when the choice of a president has to be based on more than just one criterion: It must abide by the principle of meritocracy underlying public life in Singapore; it must satisfy certain competency benchmarks; and ideally, it ought to also reflect the multiracial character of society.
These are reasons why perfect refinements have eluded this institution. At the core of the debate is the deep-felt need to have presidents of all races over time. Many agree that too many years have passed since the nation has had a president from the Malay community. It would gratify them that a decision has been taken to reserve the next presidential election in 2017 for Malay candidates. Multiracialism, after all, is no less a marker of Singapore's political identity than is meritocracy. Much as the group representation constituency mechanism serves to ensure the parliamentary presence of the minority races, the elected presidency should reflect the agency of the minorities in the public life of Singapore. Several ways have been suggested to do this but none has been found that is universally acceptable. The ""hiatus-triggered"" model is also not perfect but it is the least objectionable of the solutions considered thus far.
Given the demographic heft of the majority Chinese, the objective of having respected figures of all races in the Istana could have fallen by the electoral wayside without legislative intervention. Reserving the next election for Malay candidates will help Singaporeans to see how a mandated break in open elections can help ensure no race is left out over very long periods. But a reserved election will be fruitful only if candidates with the right qualifications step forward.
This is a crucial caveat. For the presidency to remain an office of election and not selection, the quality and number of Singaporeans prepared to serve is vitally important. A negative pall would be cast if standards were lowered or if only one candidate stands. Competition would give Singaporeans of all races a chance to vote. And there is no better way for citizens to affirm the importance of the office to them and its multiracial character than by exercising their vote. Being an institution that buffers the nation from the siren calls of populism and also one that unifies Singaporeans, it should never be taken for granted.

"," Presidential elections; Race; Meritocracy
","   Of the changes to the elected presidency passed by Parliament last week, the one to reserve an election for a particular racial group is the most contentious.
With that change to the Constitution, a presidential election will be reserved for a particular racial group if no one from that group has been president for five terms in a row. That means in the course of six presidential terms, there should be at least one Chinese, one Malay, plus one president from the Indian and other minority communities.
Candidates in the reserved elections will meet the same criteria as those running in open elections.
Other changes include stricter qualifying criteria for presidential candidates and more powers for an expanded Council of Presidential Advisers.
The changes have several implications. First, Singapore will, after a 46-year wait, see a Malay president in the next election provided there are qualified candidates. The Republic's first president Yusof Ishak was Malay and held the post from 1965, when Singapore became independent, to 1970, when he died in office. Before that, he was Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State) from 1959, the year Singapore achieved self-rule from the British.
With the Prime Minister's announcement that the next presidential election, due next year, will be reserved for Malays, President Tony Tan Keng Yam will not be able to run for a second term. He has since confirmed that he will not be standing again. There will also be no repeat of the fierce contest between four candidates - all of them Chinese men - seen in 2011. That turned out to be a close fight between Dr Tony Tan and Dr Tan Cheng Bock, who obtained 35.2 per cent and 34.85 per cent of votes respectively. The changes to the Constitution passed last week effectively deny Dr Tan Cheng Bock the chance to take part in the next election and that has raised questions about the timing of the amendment.
Another big concern is what these changes will mean for Singapore's founding principles of meritocracy and equality. These principles tell us that leaders should be assessed based on their capabilities, and not race, family or social status. Would not the changes passed last week be a blow to Singapore's meritocracy and instead entrench race-based politics? That is the basis of some people's opposition.
But even within the Malay/ Muslim community, there is a diversity of views. Some consider the Government's plan as tokenism, akin to letting Malays win a runners-up medal since no one from the community is capable of competing in an open and fair election against other ethnic groups. On the other hand, there are Malays who embrace the amendments with open arms. They have long regarded the late Mr Yusof as a symbol of pride and cannot wait to see another president emerge from the community. Whatever the shortcomings, the amendments passed ensure that the sanctity and prestige of the elected presidency are not compromised, through the provision of several safeguards. The first is a higher bar for candidates such that only capable individuals need apply. There are no exceptions and minorities have to meet the same strict qualifying criteria.
The second safeguard is that since the next election is reserved for Malays, Malay candidates who want to win must drum up support among all Singaporeans, regardless of their race or religion. He or she cannot campaign solely on a platform of Malay interests but must instead seek to represent Singapore's multicultural and secular values.
Mr Yusof exemplified these values. In the 1940s and 1950s, he was managing editor of Utusan Melayu - a popular Malay language newspaper which advocated for the upliftment of the Malays. Yet, he championed the interests of all races throughout his presidency, earning praise from all racial groups.
As a nation, we must hold fast to a vision of a Singapore that is race-blind. Recent polls, however, show that we have not quite achieved that yet. At the same time, there is a risk that if there is no president from a particular racial group for a long time, the issue could be politicised should some claim that discrimination is at play. Therefore, there is a need to intervene to ensure multiracial representation in the years before our ideal of a race-blind nation is realised.
Some countries introduce affirmative action to level the playing field for all races. While Singapore has made huge strides in fair treatment of minorities, we have to be upfront and admit that the system has never been a perfect meritocracy. Instead, it has always been an ""abridged"" one. Nonetheless, it is this abridged meritocracy that has ensured minority representation in our parliamentary democracy, which also stabilises race relations in the country. Thus, applying it to the elected presidency scheme is not unprecedented and has its merits.
Questions about how a race-based election will affect our meritocracy will persist. However, on a broader trajectory, reserving the next presidential election for Malays is in my view a necessary form of tokenism to develop trust among the races.
After a break of more than four decades, it is timely to elect a Malay president and give him or her a chance to represent all Singaporeans, just as Mr Yusof did during his tenure in the 1960s.
But even as we do so, we must not lose sight of our principles that guide us to elect our leaders based on their capabilities.The writer is a fellow at the Iseas - Yusof Ishak Institute. He is the author of Yusof Ishak: Singapore's First President.

","   The election last week of Mr Donald Trump as United States president sent shock waves around the globe. But has it translated to a tsunami of doubt about little Singapore's future?
We have always been prepared to roll with the punches and we knew that the day after would be a question of us facing a bad, or less-bad, outcome. It does, however, remind us of the need for long-term governance systems that fundamentally build up our resilience as well as anticipatory instincts. How have we done that?
First, be it Brexit, or rival presidential candidates Hillary Clinton or Mr Trump, Singapore has always been a ""price-taker"" in these big geopolitical shifts. As with another huge external force - climate change - that might reshape our future, we can only try to mitigate or adapt to risk.
We plan for the long-term trends and sharp turns in our external operating environment. In foreign affairs, we invest heavily in developing strategic relationships; no power is too small nor too large to be strategic partners with. While we contribute to the international rule of law, we can also be found in key regional and multilateral forums on trade, strategic and defence relations.
To illustrate, Singapore always strives to be an invited guest at the Group of 20 leaders' summit and was, this year, again honoured with that privilege to listen in on the big boys in Hangzhou, China. Both the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership initiatives, championed by America and China respectively, are of interest to Singapore.
In the same way, our commercial interests hedge their bets as long as they have the intelligence, corporate muscle and suitable legal frameworks to do so. They reach into developed as well as far-flung underdeveloped markets - after all, they must be prepared for changes in sentiment on free trade and foreign investment flows.
At home, these commercial interests' hunches have been up since last January when current American President Barack Obama first contemplated taxing the repatriation of foreign earnings.
Singapore responds to its ""vulnerability"" by building strong outriggers; it is an important discipline to maintain.
Second, in our local socio-political order, we have tried to build a tough inner mettle through inclusive political and social policies.
This can be seen in the emerging discussion about how the new economy of disruption requires a collective effort to reskill workers, and review social safety nets - a point Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam addressed at the McKinsey Innovation Forum last month.
Across the developed world today, there is a deep sense of job and income insecurity. The question posed is whether globalisation, free trade and being part of the broader post-World War II international system truly results in inclusive and equitable growth.
Achieving fair and equitable economic development has also defined Singapore's governance system from the very start. It is a fundamental social compact that the governing party has with its citizens. There was a renewed impetus to achieve that through active state intervention in the late 2000s and certainly after the watershed 2011 General Election when six opposition politicians won seats in Parliament.
We had our own ""mini-Brexit vote"" then as the result was in good part a reaction by ordinary citizens to what they perceived as an all-too-lax immigration and foreign labour policy - a leitmotif of the campaigns by the political opposition then.
Changes were made in labour, social support, education and urban planning policies. Campaigns on immigration in the subsequent General Election last year failed to ignite.
Being an open, globalised and developed economy means that Singapore tends to be the first to be battered by shifts in the global economy and the attendant waves of change and discontent. But, having a responsive political system, and yes, opposition politics as well as citizens taking to alternative media to express their views, has meant that there has been a whole-of-Singapore change to keep society on an even keel.
The burden is now on the Committee on the Future Economy to tap the wisdom of change-leaders to help us find new business opportunities and warn of the stronger safety nets we may need.
Third, what of our response to the rising sense of tribalism sweeping across the world?
People are seeking refuge from socio-economic discontent in the ascriptive identities of race - in nationalism; in returning to the country from the city; in wishing for the glory days of their religious communities and faith. They want leaders with messianic visions of the future, who talk tough even if it means that they undermine the rule of law.
Singapore has had to deal with those impluses since 1965, and 2016 is no different. How? Again, policies to ensure equitable economic growth and social integration amidcultural diversity are ongoing national priorities. On the other hand, with the rise of new communication technologies, religiously-inspired terrorism and the culture wars, security and legal agencies of the state have had to evolve new ways of spotting specific threats to our multiracial cohesion. This year's prosecution of the website editor behind fabricated articles that incited xenophobic sentiment, and the detention of Bangladeshi workers planning terror in their homeland, amply demonstrate how that vigilance operates.
Our commitment to social cohesion is also exemplified by the deliberate, delicate and thoughtful nine-month public engagement process that fed into the reform of our elected presidency. We have decided to introduce the reserved election element to symbolise multiracial inclusion, with no compromise to our system of equitable meritocracy.
In a nutshell, we have made, and must continue to make, every effort to anticipate the geopolitical, economic and social shifts that might affect us. If we do succumb to some of the multifarious risks out there, it will not be for lack of trying to avoid them. At that point, we have our long-term social and political systems, as well as our unique foreign policy, to help us bounce back. We will be smart, strategic and resilient enough to take advantage of all that the Trump presidency represents and becomes.The writer is deputy director (research) at the Institute of Policy Studies, National University of Singapore.

313,"The support for the death penalty is as follows: 92 per cent for intentional murder, 88 per cent for discharging a firearm and 86 per cent for drug trafficking.

","   Most Singaporeans are in favour of the death penalty but with exceptions, according to a new survey.
Also, fewer support the death penalty for drug trafficking and firearms in cases where no one dies or is injured.
There is less support for the mandatory death penalty as well.
These findings, released yesterday, follow a United Nations General Assembly debate in September on the death penalty and Singapore giving its judges the discretion, in specified situations, to lift the death penalty for drug couriers.
There is a growing worldwide trend to abolish the death penalty, noted National University of Singapore (NUS) associate law professor Chan Wing Cheong, one of four researchers who headed the study.
""It is important for Singapore to continue to review the death penalty because it is irreversible,"" he said.
NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser, Singapore Management University law don Jack Lee and human rights group Maruah president Braema Mathi also led the study, which polled about 1,500 Singapore citizens aged 18 to 74 between April and May this year.
Singapore's approach to capital punishment was restated when the UN General Assembly debated the issue this year and urged countries to abolish it.
However, four years ago, Singapore had lifted the mandatory death sentence for drug couriers who play a minor role, such as transporting and delivering, and who help the police nab the ringleaders, for instance.
Those who commit murder but did not intend to kill can also escape the gallows.
But the mandatory punishment remains for intentional murder, drug trafficking and firearms-related offences. In such cases, the courts do not have the discretion to decide on a lighter sentence.
The support for the death penalty is as follows: 92 per cent for intentional murder, 88 per cent for discharging a firearm and 86 per cent for drug trafficking.
But when asked whether these same crimes should carry a mandatory death penalty, 47 per cent said ""yes"" for intentional murder, 36 per cent for firearms offences and 32 per cent for drug trafficking.
People are also more reluctant for the death penalty to be imposed when they know the details of a crime.
The respondents were given 12 scenarios based on real-life cases that ranged from intentional murder to drug trafficking and firearms offences. Each case had either mitigating factors, such as the offender having no prior record, or aggravating factors, like the victim dying.
The respondents chose the death penalty in only one-third of the cases, although all 12 got the mandatory death penalty under the law.
Supporters said they believe it deters would-be offenders from committing serious crimes.
Most who backed the discretionary death penalty gave the reason that circumstances differ, and not every offender deserves to die.
Older Singaporeans and those who are more highly educated are also more likely to support the death penalty in general.
Prof Tan said this may be because the middle-class in Singapore values security highly and believes strongly in meritocracy - that people should be rewarded for hard work, but also punished for wrongdoings.
The support also varies across religions, with Taoists and Buddhists twice as likely to support the death penalty as Protestant Christians. Protestant Christians themselves are twice as likely as Catholics to support the death penalty.
But Prof Chan said people are unlikely to strongly oppose any gradual move towards judges getting more discretion on when to impose the death penalty.
He pointed out that the study shows most people not having strong views for or against the death penalty.
""A very small percentage insists on the present scheme,"" he said.
Prof Lee added: ""Whether or not we move towards abolishing the death penalty, perhaps we should consider whether judges should be given more discretion.""

","   The next presidential election is due in eight months, but the past year saw significant changes to the highest office of the land, as Singaporeans took part in a public debate and reflected on what the post means to a multiracial nation.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong initiated the process in January when he raised the need to review Singapore's political system during the debate on the President's Address, and convened a Constitutional Commission to review the elected presidency a month later.
The nine-member commission, chaired by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, called for feedback from the public to aid its work.
More than 100 individuals and groups sent in submissions, and 19 expanded on their views during four public hearings held by the commission in April and May.
Most of the exchange centred on two key aspects - how to ensure that the president, as guardian of the reserves, has a baseline financial competency; and how to ensure that members of minority communities are elected president from time to time, as a reflection of Singapore's multiracial identity.
SYMBOL OF UNITY
The commission agrees emphatically that a race-blind society is the only legitimate aspiration for Singapore... But there is a pressing need to ensure that no ethnic group is shut out of the presidency even as progress is made towards that ideal, lest the office of president loses its vitality as a symbol of the nation's unity.
REPORT BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION
The commission's report was released to the public in September.
It made a range of proposals, but two key changes underscored the focus of the public hearings.
One, a candidate from the private sector must have helmed a company with at least $500 million in shareholder equity to qualify, up from the current $100 million in paid-up capital.
Two, an election should be reserved for members of a particular racial group if there has not been a president from the group for the five most recent presidential terms.
""The commission agrees emphatically that a race-blind society is the only legitimate aspiration for Singapore,"" the report said.
""But there is a pressing need to ensure that no ethnic group is shut out of the presidency, even as progress is made towards that ideal, lest the office of president loses its vitality as a symbol of the nation's unity,"" it added.
Singapore has not had a Malay president since its first president, Mr Yusof Ishak, died in office in 1970.
The president had been appointed and was a largely ceremonial position until 1991, when the elected presidency was introduced to safeguard the reserves and approve key public service appointments.
Raising the eligibility criteria was a reminder that the president needed certain qualifications to act as the second key to the reserves.
But the president's role as a unifying figure is equally important.
Critics charged that reserved elections were an affront to Singapore's cherished principle of meritocracy. A segment of the public also seemed apprehensive about them.
At public forums after the report was released, participants were mostly supportive of raising the eligibility criteria, but were split on the issue of reserved elections.
Dialogues with minority groups were no different. At an event for the Malay community, a grassroots leader said the president's race did not matter as much as his capacity to care for Singaporeans.
This prompted another participant to argue that Singapore's racial harmony was not by happenstance, but a result of carefully calibrated policy measures.
The Government took pains to stress that even in reserved elections, the eligibility criteria would not be lowered.
But it also took public wariness of such a stipulation as a sign that Singaporeans widely believe in a meritocratic approach to policies here.
Even so, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said - in a statement in September accepting the commission's main recommendations - that the Government has always ensured that ""even as we practise meritocracy, all races in Singapore feel that they have a place and equal opportunities"".
Last month, 39 MPs spoke over three days of debate in Parliament before amendments to the Constitution were passed.
And as there have been five terms without a Malay head of state since the elected presidency was introduced, next year's election will be reserved for Malay candidates.
This means that in September, Singapore will have its first Malay president in more than 46 years.

He oversees a school system that has just been ranked No. 1 in a prestigious international benchmarking test, but Education Minister in charge of schools Ng Chee Meng is filled with ""divine discontent"".
There have been many attempts to explain the No. 1 ranking in mathematics, science and reading that 15-year-olds here recently achieved in what is dubbed education's World Cup - the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) conducted by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Education experts worldwide have put Singapore's success story under scrutiny and concluded that it is down to rigour, coherence in policy implementation and a culture that prioritises academics. But Mr Ng says the ""secret sauce"" is the 33,000-strong teaching service.
A 2010 report by global management consulting firm McKinsey praises Singapore's pool of great teachers, achieved by making teaching appealing to its top students with competitive salaries, rigorous training and opportunities to grow professionally.
Clearly proud of the ""army"" under his purview, Mr Ng says: ""Education ministers from other countries often ask me what are the key ingredients. I tell them that we have forward-looking policies and good systems in place. But really the key thing is our teachers and the first-rate work they do.From fighter pilot to education minister
Education Minister (Schools) Ng Chee Meng rose from fighter pilot to become Chief of Air Force and then Chief of Defence Force before entering politics in 2015.
He went to the former Hua Yi Primary, The Chinese High for four years, and then Hwa Chong Junior College (the latter two are now Hwa Chong Institution).
He received the Singapore Armed Forces Overseas Training Award and studied electrical engineering at the United States Air Force Academy. In 2002, he obtained a Master of Arts in international relations from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
He and wife Michelle have two daughters.
Q What were your co-curricular activities (CCAs)?
A Swimming and table tennis in primary school. In secondary school, the National Police Cadet Corps. I also trained to be a lifeguard. NPCC was my highlight. It was during that time that I met my wife Michelle, who was in NPCC - and who attended Cedar Girls' - but we didn't date then.
In junior college, I joined the Science Club, won a national schools medal in taekwondo and received my private pilot licence through the Junior Flying Club.
Q How did you cope with so many CCAs and your A levels?
A It was a major juggling act. Thankfully, I had four months to study.
Q And your favourite teacher?
A Madam Salome Chua, my science teacher in Chinese High. She was also my CCA teacher.
She provided a loving environment for a boisterous bunch of boys, and took time to share her life journey and values.
I still keep in touch with her. Her dedication and commitment to ensure we had the best outcomes were really heartwarming.
Q What was your favourite subject?
A My favourite in primary school was PE - no need to study. When I grew older, science was my favourite. Languages were never my forte.
""You can have the best policies, but without the commitment and dedication of teachers, we will not be able to deliver real outcomes.""
But he admits that not all is right, hence his ""divine discontent"", a phrase Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong used in his National Day Rally Speech to urge Singaporeans to never rest on their laurels.
Part of Mr Ng's concern stems from complaints by employers and company chiefs, who say Singapore workers, despite being technically good and hardworking, do not think out of the box and lack the derring-do to push boundaries.
He feels it is fair criticism and agrees there is a need to break away from the shackles of some parts of local culture - the kiasuism (being afraid to lose out) and kiasism (being timid). Especially when the world is changing so rapidly and disruption is happening all around. ""What has afforded success for one generation, may not for another,"" he says.
He stresses that to thrive in the new economy, Singaporean workers need to move up the value chain. ""So an engineer, instead of just being able to work complex machinery, should be able to design one.""
NURTURING FROM YOUNG
So, how does Singapore create workers who can create value?
By nurturing the ""entrepreneurial dare"" in young Singaporeans.
Mr Ng is quick to add that he does not mean all Singaporeans should become entrepreneurs or businessmen. ""It's a mindset. An attitude of wanting to do better, find break- throughs, of wanting to innovate. If I were to use a Hokkien word, it would be chiong, not a reckless chiong, but taking into account the risks involved and doing it anyway.""
The nurturing has to start from young, in school.
He has looked at the education systems of the United States and Israel, two nations known for innovation and entrepreneurship. What struck him is the informal learning that goes on alongside the formal learning in their schools.
To explain how informal learning can nurture the traits and qualities making up ""entrepreneurial dare"", he brings up examples from local schools. One is the so-called ""makerspaces"" cropping up in schools which teach design thinking to all students. ""It's an environment for kids to explore, to create. In the process, some may fail, but failing is part of the route to success,"" he says.
A WALL OF OPPORTUNITY
Another example is the 9m climbing wall in Hougang Primary. Pupils from Primary 3 onwards get to try climbing during PE.
Mr Ng says: ""It's just a wall, but it presents so many opportunities to learn things like grit and resilience, cooperation, because you depend on your schoolmates, the belayers who secure climbers at the end of the rope. In the process, they learn how to work as a team, cooperate, communicate and rely on each other. These are the qualities caught through sports like this. It's difficult to do this in the classroom.""
THE EDUCATION MINISTER ON...
PSLE CHANGES
With the wider scoring bands, students should typically have six to eight good schools with different strengths to choose from. And we are hoping that parents will look at the interests and budding talents of their children and choose schools that will nurture them in these other areas as well. We hope to shift parents' mindsets where parents recognise that, yes, building a strong academic core is still important, but there are other aspects ... that would make a big difference.
DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSIONS
It was started to find different pathways for kids to express their talents in other areas. It is not for those with general academic abilities, because you have the PSLE for that. So the rationale is anchored on creating multiple pathways. And we must go back to this original rationale.
TEENAGE SUICIDES
I'm always saddened whenever I read of such a case. I am a father, it really saddens me.
When we work with the Institute of Mental Health to understand the factors, psychiatrists tell us that suicide is a very complex issue and many a time it's multi-causal.
Academic stresses play a part, but issues like family relations and boy-girl relationships can have great impact on a young mind. So we have put in counsellors across all schools. We have trained our teachers to recognise early symptoms and do the necessary referrals. Through sports and activities, we hope to build students' coping ability and resilience.
He urges parents not to constantly smoothen the pathway for their children, but to allow them to fail and try again. ""I am a parent with two daughters, so I know how parents feel. But we all need to take a step back and think if we are really helping our children...
""Parents may have the best intentions, but imagine if this is aggregated over 10 years, until the child is 16 or 18. The child may not have had the necessary experiences to know how to bounce back from failure, a tenacious attitude to overcome obstacles and succeed in life.""
He urges a paradigm shift, away from the unhealthy focus on exam grades and getting into top schools. ""We all have to ask ourselves: Ultimately, what is education's mission? Is it about exam results? Is it about reaching No. 1 on Pisa? The answer must be 'no'. It's really about helping our children discover the joy of learning and preparing them for the future.""
He admits being bothered by the ""niggling Pisa question"" - why is it that Singapore, despite doing so well in these global tests, does not go on to produce prize-winning scientists, innovators and entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs? Yet, the US, which is placed much lower than Singapore in such tests, produces world leaders in many fields.
Mr Ng goes back to Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmu- garatnam's response to the same question, when it was posed by CNN journalist Fareed Zakaria several years ago. Mr Tharman had said that, unlike the US, Singapore was an exam meritocracy, not a talent meritocracy, and the US had a culture of learning that challenges conventional wisdom. ""These are the areas where Singapore must learn from America,"" he said.
Mr Ng highlights notable Singaporeans, including Ms Olivia Lum who founded the water treatment firm Hyflux, Mr Sim Wong Hoo who invented the Sound Blaster sound card and founded Creative Technology, and Raffles Institution student Deanna See who last month won a US$250,000 (S$360,000) prize funded by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for her homemade video explaining antibiotic resistance. And declares: ""Never say never. I am optimistic. In another 10, 20 years we may have a Joseph Schooling equivalent of a scientist from A*Star...
""The thing is, how do we increase the probability of this happening?
""The way to do it is to keep the academic rigour but build in our students the X-factor - that entrepreneurial dare.""

","   Benny Lim, who retired last April, began his 37-year public service career in the Singapore Police Force. He rose to become Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs, National Security Coordination Secretariat, Prime Minister's Office, and Ministry of National Development. In this interview in the forthcoming issue of Urban Solutions, the biannual magazine from the Centre for Liveable Cities, he reflects on the limits of Singapore's social harmony. He advocates rebooting nation-building efforts to address the inevitable tensions of increasing diversity.
Q What key principles have guided Singapore's approach to living with diversity?
A Singapore enjoys a level of racial harmony that many observers describe as exceptional. Without detracting any significance from this achievement, I think it is useful to locate this observation against both historical and living contexts.
Singapore's commitment to being a nation that belongs to all Singaporeans regardless of ethnicity is a product of political ideology, choice and circumstance in history. From the outset, the concept of a multi-ethnic nation of citizens with equal citizenship rights has been a cornerstone of the national ideology.
Indeed, one may argue that this fundamental difference between Singapore and Malaysia made separation (into two nation states) inevitable.
Generally speaking, in the first two decades of independence, nation building was prioritised. Initiatives such as communal engagement, mass campaigns, national service, and overarching symbols of unity and national values, such as the pledge, weaved a common ideological fabric across diverse identities. English was chosen as the common language of administration and meritocracy was enshrined as the organising principle in determining the advancement of citizens.
Singapore's governance framework was centred on a secular state, which offered protection through the rule of law to all citizens. Tough laws were applied robustly against those who threatened communal peace.
On matters of well-being, however, the state was prepared to provide special support to the minorities, like the creation of statutory bodies and special provisions in the Constitution. This reflected a pragmatic appreciation of the difficulties of the minorities to otherwise compete against the dominance of the Chinese majority.
What our history tells us is that we did not arrive at this state of ethnic harmony without conscious design, perseverance and effort. Central to that effort is the creation and development of a national identity called the Singapore citizen and the development of a governance framework that has maintained ethnic peace by cultivating public acceptance and trust.
In the last three decades, with political stability and order, our priorities on nation building seemed to have taken a back seat. Racial and religious harmony continued to be prioritised - but discretely and not as an integral aspect or part of a larger purposive nation-building enterprise.
Q Where has Singapore done well and which area needs more work?
A If you measure communal harmony by the number of inter-ethnic conflicts, then you could say we have succeeded.
Our justice system has played a crucial role. Surveys on public confidence in government institutions typically find the police and courts at the top of the list. Confidence in the integrity, impartiality and professionalism of our law enforcement agencies and judiciary is very high.
From my own experience as a police officer, conflict between actors of different races in Singapore seldom leads to serious violence or rioting. Instead, what usually happen are calls to the police by both parties or an observer and, regardless of the ethnicity of the police officer who arrives, there is trust and confidence in his intervention. This restraint rests on both the effectiveness of the deterrence in strict laws against violence, especially race-based violence, and the trust in the authorities to dispense justice fairly.
Over time, the ideal and the value of ethnic harmony have come to be accepted and supported by most citizens. Polls consistently confirm this consensus.
However, I wonder if what undergirds this consensus is not radically different from why Singaporeans value the safe and secure low-crime environment we have. Peace, safety, order and the danger of ethnic fault lines sparking tension and conflict are well appreciated by Singaporeans.
If this is so, and our ethnic harmony rests mainly at this level of consensus alone, and is not anchored by deep personal bonds of trust, mutual understanding and by a strong national identity, then we need perhaps to think about the strength and resilience of this ethnic harmony and reflect on its limits.Short takes
- Does Singapore's ethnic harmony rest on just mental consensus, or is it anchored in deep personal bonds of trust and mutual understanding?
- Singapore's most successful integration programme? The Housing Board estate.
- On immigration: Consider a term permanent residency (PR) scheme. If someone does not take up citizenship after being a permanent resident for a certain number of years, convert the PR back to a work pass that allows him to work here. Once the work stops, he loses the long-term right to stay in Singapore.
- Nation building needs to be stepped up, to bridge divides in class and religion.
Q In your opinion, what have been the most successful government initiatives in bringing different communities together?
A In terms of urban and physical planning, I think the most important programme has been our public housing estates by the Housing Board (HDB).
I believe that the HDB heartland, where more than four out of five Singaporeans live, is a shared universe that is diverse in many ways and yet similar in so many concerns through the sharing of daily experiences in a common space.
For these reasons, I think we should focus our community- building activities in the HDB heartland. Such activities should not dwell self-consciously on just promoting inter-ethnic bonding. We have to ask how we can get people to form real bonds of trust and friendship and cultivate reflexes for empathy and tolerance.
Crafting the right programmes that resonate with the ground is key. Grassroots leaders tell me that their durian parties are always oversubscribed by residents and certainly multi-ethnic in appeal. In the heyday of our Malaysia Cup (football) campaigns, the Kallang Roar was as spontaneous as it was multi-ethnic in voices! Such activities or programmes should engage the wider community, with multi-ethnic participation as one of the desired, but not necessarily declared, outcomes.
Q Many perceive a backlash against immigration in the West. Do you see this happening in Singapore?
A Singaporeans' concerns over foreigners arose when they perceived unfair treatment. Policy shifts in the last five years have done much to address such grievances. Jobs and job opportunities is the domain where such anxieties may still persist; crowdedness and congestion seem to have become less of a source of acute angst.
I don't think Singaporeans want to do away with foreign workers who build their homes and train lines, support their families with housework or take care of their frail elderly. Moreover, the proportion of citizens marrying foreign nationals has been consistent and was more than one in three in 2015.
Having said that, I believe we can do more in the integration of new citizens. We ought to give more thought to our engagement programmes, or even evaluate how integrated a person has become in our society, as a consideration for citizenship.
For instance, we may want to consider a term permanent residency (PR) system where those who choose not to be citizens when eligible can be reverted to employment pass. In this case, they can continue to live and work here but with no right of permanent stay, and can leave when they retire or stop working.
This is a tweak and formalises the current roundabout regime of the fixed-term Re-Entry Permit. It calls a spade a spade and makes PR a commitment towards citizenship.
Q What are some of the difficulties in physically accommodating an increasingly diverse population, such as Nimby (not-in-my-backyard) sentiments, and how can we address them?
A As a general principle, public interest should not be held hostage to self-centred individual interests, especially when there is no encroachment of the lawful space they own. We should be prepared to take a decision, agree to disagree and proceed.
At the community level, there is a real need for some kind of conflict- resolution mechanism.
Complaints about noise, for instance, are among the most common complaints lodged by residents to the police. However, unless it clearly breaches existing laws of nuisance or health codes, there is really little that the police can do when called upon. There is a practical need to boost our capability to mediate such conflicts in a community-centric way.
Q A key issue of living with diversity is fostering social cohesion and resilience in the face of threats like terrorism. How did the initiatives you were involved in address this?
A I was involved with establishing the Community Engagement Programme (CEP), the predecessor of the current SGSecure movement.
The CEP was an effort to create an operational structure across various key domains to coordinate and manage response so that social cohesion is maintained during crises. One of its aims was to identify and train an activist cadre in each domain - workplace, schools, constituencies - to be the first responders when an incident occurs.
This was based on the observation that in most disasters, it was always the people on site who saved the most lives, because no matter how fast the firefighters or police can arrive, they would always be slower than those already there.
Another objective was that through the frequent emergency exercises, we would be able to build a network of trust and mutual confidence among the key actors, who can be relied on to maintain calm in their respective domains following an incident.
The idea for the recently opened Harmony in Diversity Gallery came from the Inter-Religious Organisation, a body that has been working to promote interfaith dialogue for peace and understanding since 1949. The gallery showcases the common strands that are found in all the religions in Singapore and also succinctly explains how the framework of maintaining religious harmony works in Singapore.
Its real potential resides in the engagement programmes that will be developed in partnership with others in the community and in the public service.
Q Looking ahead, what are the key challenges to integration facing Singapore in the next 20 to 30 years?
A The challenges to social cohesion in the future may not just come from the latent cleavages of multi-ethnicity but also from the fault lines of class. When class and ethnic lines coincide and reinforce each other, the challenge will be compounded.
Also, race today may be less salient than religion as a source of potential divisiveness. The rise of religiosity has been observed in many countries. In Singapore, it has led to an even more plural religious landscape, with differentiation occurring within religious communities.
This diverse terrain has reduced the reach of the traditional religious elite's authority. In turn, their effectiveness as mediators in inter-religious conflict may decline.
The state will have to be relied on even more to hold the ring. It needs to step up its resources and capabilities to manage this complexity. The challenge will not just be to manage competition between groups but more their demands against the state and society for concessions to their interests interpreted as their fundamental rights.
Q How can Singapore be better equipped to deal with these?
A ""Dialogic"" conflict resolution requires the parties to be able to define their interests and then negotiate and come to an acceptable solution rationally. However, when interests are pursued as rights based on ideological-religious grounds, the dispute is more deep-seated and needs to be resolved either by ""imperative"" or ""ideological"" conflict-resolution means.
Imperative conflict resolution requires contending parties to respect an authority to judge and to accept his verdict. The courts work this way; respected patriarchs, too. Ideological conflict resolution requires a supra-ideology which contending parties subscribe to. Civic nationalism is the most common form of this in the modern state.
Hence, maintaining public confidence in the justice system and cultivating national identity, pride and loyalty are ways to develop resilience in the face of our growing diversity and the tensions that come with it.
While we have paid much attention to good governance, I think we can do more for nation building. If the ideal of a multi- ethnic Singapore citizenry is to remain a cornerstone of our national ideology, we need to promote it as an integral part of nation building, of a unitary national identity based on citizenship.
It is a good time to reboot our nation-building efforts: On the ground, SG50 (Singapore's year-long celebration of 50 years of independence) and the passing of our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew have already given this process of self-discovery and rediscovery for our younger and older generations, respectively, a jump-start.

317,"[...]the values, policies and solutions which led the founding party to success became sacrosanct: sacred cows which could not be questioned even when their relevance started to wane.

"," Politics; Democracy; Political leadership; Legitimacy
","   At the IPS meet, Banyan Tree Holdings executive chairman Ho Kwon Ping spoke about politics in 2065, 50 years ahead. Here is an excerpt.
The critical question facing Singapore in 2065 is not simply whether an accidental freak election or a sustainable pendulum democracy should or might occur. It is about whether the social contract between elite governance and the body politic can become so strained and frayed that a crisis of political legitimacy may thrust unexpected, extremist scenarios - ranging from rule by a military-dominated junta to unstable coalition governments - to become a reality.
In other words, what might happen to get us from where we are now, a bastion of political stability, to the uncertainties now plaguing the rest of the world?
Let me ask and then answer three further questions in pursuit of this issue. First, what events could lead to a massive loss of legitimacy or confidence in the People's Action Party (PAP) or the current political system?
Second, what are the chances of these events happening?
Third, is a two-party pendulum democracy a likely, stable and sustainable option? Alternatively, what might realistically evolve instead, in the specific Singapore context?
Let me address the first question in a circumspect manner, by alluding to other Asian democracies. The closest, though imperfect, parallels are India and Taiwan. In both places, the founding party - the Indian National Congress and the Kuomintang (KMT) - were led by charismatic leaders, Jawaharlal Nehru and Chiang Kai-shek, who were worlds apart both in their personalities as well as in their party structures, but possessed, as founding fathers, an unquestioned legitimacy. After their passing, their offspring - Indira Gandhi and Chiang Ching-kuo -succeeded them (albeit with brief interludes in India) but after them, both the party leadership and party itself started to decline.
Three identical things happened in both parties:
First, nepotism prevented the rise of younger, meritocratic elites vying within the party for ascendancy, resulting in sycophants all clustering around the dynastic heirs, like in some archaic monarchy.
Second, the values, policies and solutions which led the founding party to success became sacrosanct: sacred cows which could not be questioned even when their relevance started to wane. A sense of political complacency settled like fine dust over even the internal insurgents and overcame any impetus towards change.
Third, a culture of entitlement led to endemic corruption both political and financial, the final blow in an inexorable decline of legitimacy.
Should that fate, which has befallen almost all founding parties in electoral democracies over time, affect the PAP in the coming decades, we have the scenario for disruptive change.
The second question is: How likely is this to happen?
The short answer is: Not very likely (I hope) in the next quarter-century, or around 20 to 25 years. Beyond that, no one knows.
Why 20 years? (Perhaps too optimistic for some and too pessimistic for others.) I chose this time span because I assume that under our present system, even when Mr Lee Hsien Loong retires, he will assume the mantle of senior minister or minister mentor, and his cohort of leaders will remain like tribal elders to guide successive leadership teams not so much in policymaking but in the preservation of the political values, self-discipline and vision which congeal into a lasting political culture.
History has shown that the values of a founding political culture can usually be transmitted with vigour down three to four generations. Beyond that, complacency and entitlement usually overwhelm the messianic urgency and self-discipline found in pioneer values. One can only hope that future PAP leaders, after our current leadership has long passed from the scene, can learn from history.
They will have a few advantages, not least being that as a young nation, with a new political culture of anti-corruption, meritocracy and multiculturalism, they will not have to battle the centuries of deep divisions which afflicted, say, Indian civilisation.
But as Sri Lanka's civil war has shown, a relatively short period of self-serving political opportunism and populism can spiral out of control rapidly. And who is to say, from what we have already seen with the descent into opportunism in even mature, developed European and American societies, that our future leaders will be so self- disciplined as to eschew even a shred of self-interest, especially if their popularity starts to wane?
As for nepotism, there are no current signs of this happening with a Lee dynasty clinging to power or promoting only its relatives. Anti-corruption has now become not just government policy but a fundamental value of our people. And the Government has shown signs that even sacred-cow policies can be re-examined if they are no longer relevant.
And so I remain, using that cliched phrase, cautiously optimistic.
The third and possibly most intriguing question is whether the scenario leading towards pendulum democracy in Singapore is the most desirable and likely long-term outcome. And if not, what are the alternatives?
Here we have a conundrum. History has generally shown, despite recent events in the West, that a pendulum democracy offers a more sustainable, dynamic equilibrium than a single-party dominant system which has no competition and falls into complacent entitlement.
On the other hand, to move from the generally well-governed stability of our current single-party dominant system to a pendulum democracy implies that a massive loss of legitimacy by the ruling party has to first occur. That is not necessarily desirable, and of course not even likely, given the current robustness of the PAP and the weakness of the opposition parties.
The danger of a single-party dominant system is political ossification over time, as the sense of entitlement encourages the nepotism, complacency and corruption which inevitably leads to the demise - and eventual re-emergence, of course - of even the most idealistic founding parties.
Therefore, one viable alternative is to institutionalise internal policy competition and deepen internal democracy within the PAP, beyond just secret elections to a central committee or politburo.
By itself, however, internal party competition cannot assure that a political elite will remain relevant to the needs of a changing population... Civil society must be further empowered as a partner to strengthen the social contract, and also as a check against inept or corrupt governance.
Access to information enables the public to robustly debate and articulate ground-up responses to the pressing societal issues of today. An information-rich society is all the more important since we've seen, in the recent US presidential elections, how social media can easily distort facts and even manufacture dis-information.

"," Give the elected presidency (EP) a chance to develop and allow it to evolve, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim yesterday urged the Malay community, in particular, its youth.
He made the appeal in response to a question during a dialogue with tertiary students on whether the upcoming presidential election, which has been reserved for Malay candidates, is ""mere tokenism"".
""I think, let's give it a chance and see how it works because no policy is cast in stone. One day, the Government might change its mind and decide that this reserved election doesn't work. You never know,"" he added.
""You've to sort of recognise the fact that we must continue to evolve and learn from the experiences on the ground.""
Dr Yaacob was speaking publicly on the EP for the first time since the Presidential Elections (Amendment) Bill was passed last week.
The Bill provided details such as the election period and the size of the committees to assess whether candidates are eligible to contest. It follows broader constitutional changes passed last November that spell out how a presidential election will be reserved for a particular racial group if no one from that group has been president for five terms in a row.
The upcoming election is reserved for the Malay community, which has not seen a Malay president for 46 years since Singapore's first president Yusof Ishak, who died in office on Nov 23, 1970.
Dr Yaacob, who is also Minister for Communications and Information, also answered a range of questions from cyber security and youth employment to the birth rate in the dialogue, held as part of an inaugural Singapore Model Cabinet event.
Organised by Reach, the agency that facilitates the Government's engagement with citizens, the event saw over 100 students learning about policymaking and participating in simulated Cabinet meetings.
In his reply, Dr Yaacob, who reiterated that he will not contest the election, said his preference ""would have been clearly an open election, where a Malay could actually win the EP on his or her own merit"".
""But I think we also have to ask ourselves whether or not we are able to achieve that if we take that risk,"" he added.
He said tribal tendencies ""are still very strong"" and ""run deep"", not just among the miniorities, but even among the majorities.
""So how you ensure that the imbalance doesn't become a burden on the minority is something which the Government has to think about all the time,"" he added.
He said the Malay community is concerned ""not just about the president, but also Malay permanent secretary, Malay general... because we want to see representation across the entire Singaporean life"".
""But we believe it must come about because of meritocracy. Even for the elected president, you don't just pick up somebody from Geylang Serai - the person must qualify, the person must earn the respect of all Singaporeans,"" he added.

"," Singapore's six full-time madrasahs will receive an annual grant of up to $1.5 million to improve the quality of education in secular subjects, such as science and mathematics.
About $100,000 will be put up for an estimated 350 new awards, for students who shine in these subjects. The rest will go to the 127 teachers of secular subjects, as financial incentives or training grants.
The grant makes good on a pledge that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made, in 2015, to give the teaching of these subjects in madrasahs a boost.
The awards for madrasah teachers and students were announced yesterday by Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim.
The government grant will be matched by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis), which is setting aside its own funds for religious education.
Muis will pour $1.1 million a year into incentives and training for the 112 teachers of religious subjects, and about $100,000 into awards for students who excel in subjects such as Islamic jurisprudence and theology.
""This partnership between the Government and the community will encourage our madrasah students and teachers to continue to improve themselves and be the best that they can be,"" said Dr Yaacob, at the debate on the budget for the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. Muis is a statutory board under its purview.
Yesterday, Muis' deputy chief executive, Dr Albakri Ahmad, told The Straits Times that the government grant will help madrasahs do even better at national exams.
Dr Yaacob said that 98 per cent of madrasah students who sat the PSLE were eligible for a secondary school course in either the madrasahs or national schools last year, up from 91 per cent in 2012. More qualified for the Express stream as well.
""These trends bode well for the future of our asatizah fraternity and Muslim institutions,"" he said.
Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong GRC) wanted to know if there were plans to review the Administration of Muslim Law Act.
The minister said that draft proposals will be put up for public consultation on March 14. The amendments seek to reinforce Muslim institutions, enhance the management of Muslim assets and further strengthen Muslim families.
Dr Yaacob also gave updates on the new Madrasah Al-Arabiah campus in Toa Payoh.
It will be equipped with up-to-date information technology infrastructure and facilities, and is estimated to cost $17 million.
Muis has set aside $10 million for the new campus and the madrasah will raise the rest. Construction is expected to start next year.
Dr Yaacob also said that collections for the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF) have been healthy, despite a revision last June that saw Muslims paying $1 to $10 more in monthly contributions.
""The support for the changes to the MBMF is an affirmation of the affluence of our community and of our spirit of self-help,"" he said.
The 26th mosque under this fund - the Yusof Ishak Mosque in Woodlands - will be opened next month.
Dr Yaacob also responded to comments by Workers' Party MP Faisal Manap (Aljunied GRC) on wanting to see Malay-Muslims in all aspects of public life.
Mr Faisal said the move to reserve this year's presidential election for Malay candidates compromises meritocracy and added that some in the community feel that there is a lack of fair opportunity in seeing themselves represented in positions such as permanent secretary.
Dr Yaacob said that while the community hopes to see achievements in a range of fields, this will take time. ""My colleagues and I believe that what we have done all this while will give us the excellence we want in our community,"" he said.

THOSE WHO CAN'T, TEACH
The Necessary Stage
Drama Centre Theatre/ Thursday
An endearing jumble of memories untangles on stage in The Necessary Stage's revival of Those Who Can't, Teach.
There are the memories of an overworked teacher (played by Karen Tan) and her troubled former student (Joshua Lim), recalling his bittersweet time in a fictional neighbourhood school.BOOK IT /THOSE WHO CAN'T, TEACH
WHERE: Drama Centre Theatre, 05-01 National Library Building, 100 Victoria Street
WHEN: Until March 19,8pm (Wednesdays to Fridays),3pm and 8pm (Saturdays),3pm (Sundays)
ADMISSION: $28, $36, $45 from Sistic (call 6348-5555 or go to www.sistic.com.sg)
There are the memories of playwright Haresh Sharma and director Alvin Tan - not just their own teaching experience, but also their 30 years of creating theatre for Singapore.
In this script, hardly changed from its first staging in 1990, is mockery of Singaporean snobbery against plays and people using Singlish. There is commentary on a so-called meritocracy that rewards rote learners over those who think. There is unflinching reflection of a society that relies on, yet despises, dispatch drivers and food-stall owners - never mind that they too can be entrepreneurs.
The cast, including Lian Sutton and Siti Khalijah Zainal, juggle multiple roles. Ghafir Akbar stands out with his portrayals of a hobbling Malay teacher, a boisterous student who tries to get Lim's character back on the straight and narrow, and an enterprising stall-owner who wants to train the school students to use computers and manage a business. This is to the discomfort of Tan's starched class expectations - he is not a teacher, after all.
Class wars, ethnic prejudice: There is a lot happening here and two hours is not enough time to develop it all.
The structure adds to the confusion. Scenes switch between past and present and between the points of view of the teachers and the students, all played by the same five performers.
The revolving set by Wong Chee Wai seems unnecessary and the soundtrack, featuring local music from artists such as Gentle Bones and I Am David Sparkle, is not always in tune with the mood.
But the dialogue is perfectly pitched for the student audience. They laugh and moan and sigh along with the jokes, jeers and lovesickness the teenage characters display on stage.
The young viewers even listen respectfully when the cast switches to adult roles, perhaps coming to grips with the idea that teachers are human beings with their own problems.
If there is a lesson here, it is that young adults need to see more of themselves reflected on stage.
Luckily, this year has a bumper crop of drama about misfits in secondary school, such as Dream Academy's just-concluded Detention Katong and the upcoming restaging of Normal by Checkpoint Theatre. Those Who Can't, Teach fits in perfectly, despite its age.

"," The latest terrorist attacks - in London's Westminster last week and in France's Orly airport earlier this month - manifest the strategy of the self-styled Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to inspire and drive self-radicalised sympathisers around the world. Its message to such people might be summed up as: do what you can, with whatever you have, wherever you are and whenever possible.
Such ""lone wolf"" attacks are going to be more common. Taking a back seat are the sophisticated attacks, like 9/11, when terrorists took control of and crashed aircraft into buildings in America in 2001, the July 7 attacks on London's public transport in 2005, and the Paris attack in November 2015, all requiring elaborate planning and execution involving many people.
What should our society's response be to the pervasive threat that terrorism presents today?
First, the Government and Singaporeans should not overreact. To be sure, all necessary precautions have to be taken; that much is expected of the Government. But that response alone is grossly inadequate. The SGSecure initiative seeks to prepare Singaporeans to identify threats and respond decisively in the eventuality of a terrorist attack. Even then, the Government has been prudent to remind Singaporeans that even the best of efforts will not result in total security. Hence, the SGSecure's ""not if, but when"" tagline.
On the other hand, overreacting can undermine the trust between communities engendered over the years. This occurs when the acts of a misled few are imputed to the community at large.
To do so would give rise to debilitating suspicion and animosity among different communities, compromising our ability to close ranks and rally together as one. The social fabric torn asunder is an outcome that must be guarded against.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's timely reminder in 2006 when he launched the Community Engagement Programme (now incorporated as part of the SGSecure initiative) bears reiteration.
He said: ""We must know that this is not a Malay-Muslim problem. This is a national problem and non-Muslims also have to play our part, for example, by preserving the space for minorities in the majority Chinese society by upholding the ideals of meritocracy and equal opportunity and treatment, regardless of race, language and religion, and by clearly distinguishing the small number of extremists who are a threat to us from the majority of moderate, rational, loyal Muslim Singaporeans, with whom we work together to tackle a shared problem.""
Second, even in the face of heightened threat levels, we must endeavour to ensure that our way of life is not dictated by terrorism. Consider the London attack last week. It is hard to see how precautions could have been undertaken to prevent the attack, save for extremely disruptive methods that would have come at an exceptional cost and would have been an acknowledgement of deep-seated fear. The better approach is to focus on things within our control. This includes strengthening our multi-racialism and enhancing inter-ethnic ties. The increased threat level should inspire us to make that extra effort to reach out to fellow Singaporeans and acquire a better understanding of the issues and what is at stake in these challenging times.
These will help our society to be resilient and will not provide any opportunity for others to drive a wedge using the fault lines of race, language, religion or values.
Third, the security of the nation-state and various faith communities are indivisible; the insecurity of one negatively affects the security of another. It is crucial that the Muslim community is not put on the defensive by being treated as a community ""at risk"".
Managing and responding to the terrorism threat is a national endeavour, not solely a Muslim-Singaporean concern. Spotlighting the community only exaggerates the latent perception of Muslim-Singaporeans as being particularly susceptible to violent radicalism.
It also takes us away from the imperative of a thoughtful response to a grave threat, especially in enhancing meaningful inter-faith engagement and acquiring a deeper appreciation of the commonalities that bind our plural society. Given the policymakers' self-ascription of Singapore as an ""iconic target"" for terrorists, social cohesion and resilience are critical resources in ensuring that Singapore does not implode in the aftermath of a terrorist strike.
Fourth, heightened vigilance should not result in excessive policing and surveillance. Ring-fencing the heart and soul of Singaporean society cannot be just a hard-nosed security exercise, for that only generates suspicion among communities. Managing the terrorism threat requires the sensitive implementation of security measures that are aligned with our overarching shared values of non-discrimination, the rule of law and our fundamental liberties.
Security and liberty need not be traded off against each other. Security measures should not breed distrust between the authorities and the people, within the Muslim community and among the people.
The strongest protection against radicalisation and the best form of resilience is a society that is committed to and gives effect to its values and way of life in word and in deeds, even in challenging times.
Fifth, terrorism thrives on the powerful appeal of religiously inspired ideas and values on co-religionists, which cannot be countered by coercive policing, draconian laws and tough rhetoric. The better strategy is to challenge those captivating but misleading ideas and values head on. This contesting of ideas is crucial as part of the process of persuasion. However, this challenge must come from knowledgeable and credible voices within the Muslim-Singaporean community.
Ultimately, robust social cohesion requires the equally important vanguard action of strengthening Singaporean society that terror entrepreneurs seek to fragment and impose their nihilism on.
The mindset and actions of each of us matter tremendously, as the cohesion and resilience of our society cannot be engineered top-down by the Government, but will have to grow organically in the hearts and minds of every Singaporean.The resolute faith and confidence in our society, our shared values and way of life is the best form of protection and resilience.

"," This is the third of 12 primers on current affairs issues that are part of the outreach programme for The Straits Times-Ministry of Education National Current Affairs Quiz
Singaporeans will elect a president this September, in the first election since changes to the Constitution were passed last November.
All the candidates will have to be from the Malay community this round, under a new rule that reserves presidential elections for candidates from a particular racial group, if there has not been a president from the group for a period of time.
The criterion to qualify to run for president was also tightened, and candidates from the private sector will have to have experience helming companies that are worth a lot more.
Political observers have called these amendments to the elected presidency one of the biggest political changes in recent years.
Why were they made in the first place, and how big a deal are they?
WHAT DOES THE ELECTED PRESIDENT DO?
Singaporeans did not always elect their president. Before 1990, presidents were appointed by Parliament and had a mostly ceremonial role, save for some discretionary powers.About The Big Quiz
Each Monday, the paper's journalists will address burning questions in the Opinion section, offering unique Singaporean perspectives on complex issues.
These primers form part of the outreach of The Straits Times- Ministry of Education National Current Affairs Quiz, nicknamed The Big Quiz, which aims to promote an understanding of local and global issues among preuniversity students.
Underpinning this year's Big Quiz is a focus on disruption, a timely issue as various sectors and industries adapt to this global change.
The theme will be featured in six campus talks helmed by editors and correspondents.
Six quiz rounds will also be held for students to demonstrate their current affairs knowledge.
The nationwide event is jointly organised by The Straits Times and the Ministry of Education, with the Singapore Press Holdings Foundation as its presenting sponsor.
Pre-university schools and institutions can note these dates for participation in the coming quiz rounds and talks:
- Wednesday at Dunman High School
- April 19 at Nanyang Junior College
- April 26 at Temasek Junior College
- May 12 at Eunoia Junior College

But as Singapore prospered, first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew feared that the reserves Singapore had accumulated so far could be ""ruined in one election term"".
So the Government made the case for an elected president, to protect Singapore's national reserves and the integrity of its public services. For the president to be able to stand up to the elected government of the day, he would need a popular mandate.
The late Mr Lee likened an elected president to a goalkeeper, the last line of defence against a rogue government wanting to squander the country's hard-earned reserves or install cronies in key public positions.
The Constitution was amended in 1990 to set up the elected presidency, under which the president is elected for a term of six years and can veto the Government's drawdown of past reserves and the appointment of key public-office holders.
He or she can also block, among others, preventive detentions under the Internal Security Act and refusals of corruption probes.
The elected presidency went beyond just one man or woman, and was an institution that would ensure stability for Singapore.
At the same time, the president would continue to be a unifying symbol for all Singaporeans.
WHAT PROMPTED THE CHANGES?
Since then, the elected presidency system had been tweaked along the way. But 25 years later, three political and socioeconomic trends have prompted the Government to make a major update.
First, presidents and candidates from minority communities have been relatively scarce. Singapore has not had a Malay president - or even a Malay candidate for president - since the elected presidency took effect in 1991.
The only Malay president so far, the late Mr Yusof Ishak, was appointed head of state in 1959 and became the first president from independence in 1965 till 1970.
Singapore had an Indian president, the late Mr S R Nathan, from 1999 to 2011, but he was unopposed in the 1999 and 2005 elections.
In 2011, all four candidates in the presidential election were Chinese.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said a minority candidate who runs for president will find it hard to beat a rival from the majority race, all else being equal.
Race still matters at the ballot box, he said, and a significant number of people prefer a president or prime minister to be of their race, as a Channel NewsAsia-Institute of Policy Studies survey last year found.
If the system went unchanged, Singapore would not have a non-Chinese president for a long time, and national cohesion would be harmed if minorities felt they had no chance of being president, said Mr Lee.
To the Government, this under-representation of minority communities is exacerbated by the second trend - that elections these days are hotly contested.
The 2011 presidential election saw President Tony Tan Keng Yam elected in a four-way contest by a slim margin of 7,382 votes.
A third and separate trend was identified: that the size and the complexity of the economy and the organisations safeguarded by the president have grown tremendously.
Originally, candidates from the private sector were considered to have enough experience, if they have run large and complex companies that have at least $100 million in paid-up capital. But this threshold of $100 million is outdated and too low to guarantee that anyone who meets it will have the experience to make complex decisions, said Mr Lee.
Today, the total value of Singapore's reserves is more than $700 billion. And as of last year, there were 2,114 companies that met the threhold, compared to 158 in 1993.
To study these issues, a Constitutional Commission was set up in February last year. It received submissions from the public and held public hearings in April and May last year to hear from some of the groups and individuals who submitted their views.
The panel also looked at strengthening the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) and giving its advice greater weight.
WHAT IS NEW ABOUT THIS YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION?
Three key changes were made to the elected presidency.
One, an election will be reserved for a particular racial group if there has not been a president from the group for the five most recent presidential terms.
This applies to the Chinese, Malay and ""Indian and other minority"" communities.
Any non-reserved election will be open to people of all races.
For the purpose of determining when a reserved election must be held, the Government started counting from the term of former president Wee Kim Wee, who was the first president to exercise the powers of the elected president.
As there has been no Malay president for the latest five presidential terms - after Mr Wee were Mr Ong Teng Cheong; Mr Nathan, who served two terms; and Dr Tan - candidates for the upcoming election must be from the Malay community.
Two, a candidate from the private sector must have helmed a company with at least $500 million in shareholder equity to qualify.
This threshold will be reviewed at least once every 12 yearsby the Presidential Elections Committee.
Three, the CPA will be enlarged to include two more members, bringing the total to eight. And the president must now consult the CPA on all matters related to safeguarding Singapore's assets and appointing key public officers.
HOW DIFFERENT WILL CAMPAIGNING BE?
Campaign rules were also changed to discourage divisive electioneering. There will no longer be designated election-rally sites. Instead, candidates who want to hold rallies can pick their preferred sites, but must apply to the police for a rally permit.
They will also have more TV airtime, and can hold indoor private meetings with specific groups of voters.
Explaining the rationale for the changes, Minister Chan Chun Sing said campaigning ""must not inflame emotions and must be in keeping with the decorum and dignity of the office of the president"".
A presidential hopeful must also make a statutory declaration that he understands the role of the president as spelt out in the Constitution. This arose after several candidates made certain claims and promises in the 2011 election, suggesting that they may not have been clear about the powers and scope of the president.
HOW CONTROVERSIAL ARE THE CHANGES?
The idea of reserved elections was by far the most contentious change.
One key concern of some law dons and political scientists was that a president chosen in such an election may be viewed as a token president who lacks legitimacy.
They also felt it is a form of affirmative action that could undermine meritocracy.
But the Government stressed that the eligibility criteria will not be lowered for minority candidates. Ministers also pointed out that reserved elections will kick in only if a community goes five terms without seeing one of its own as president. This may not happen as Singapore becomes more race-blind.
Another concern, voiced by the Workers' Party (WP), which voted against the changes in Parliament, was that raising the eligibility criteria may shrink the pool of candidates and limit it to senior public officers.
This dovetailed with the criticism levelled by some on social media that the changes were meant to keep out non-establishment candidates.
The tighter criteria could mean those with a public sector background are more likely to get elected, and such a person might find it harder to be a check on the Government, they argued.
But others countered that the late Mr Ong's background as a deputy prime minister and former member of the People's Action Party (PAP) did not stop him from being an independent president.
Lastly, the debate highlighted the disconnect between the purpose of the elected president and the process of electing one.
The commission noted the contradiction between a necessarily apolitical president, and choosing him via an election, an inevitably political process.
There were also contradictions between his role of being a symbol of national unity and acting as a check on the Government.
Hence, the panel raised the question of whether the president should eventually be an appointed post once more.
During the debate in Parliament on the changes, the WP proposed splitting the symbolic and custodial roles of the president, and having an appointed president and an elected eight-member senate that would oversee the reserves.
But the PAP called the idea flawed and unworkable, saying that having eight elected individuals will lead to more politicisation.
While an election could be politicised, the changes to campaign rules will go some way towards lowering temperatures.
And while the review generated a fair amount of public debate and interest over the past year, the changes generally appear to have been accepted by the public.

"," Every now and then, this issue about the under-representation of women in leadership positions will come up, as if there were some conspiracy at play (More can be done for gender diversity at work: Grace Fu; March 5, Women's touch needed to unlock full potential of human resources; March 7).
The number of women in senior and top management positions in both the public and private sectors is not to be sniffed at.
No one can deny that diversity enriches organisations. In this context, we are talking about diversity of talent, experiences, backgrounds, qualifications, including but not exclusively, gender.
Singapore is a meritocracy and senior appointments should be given to individuals who are most suited to the jobs, regardless of gender.
Perhaps it is time to put this matter to rest, by conducting a comprehensive study of the incidence of women in leadership positions by employment sectors, and examine the reasons in areas where they are under-represented.

"," Far from being disciplined by the rituals and responsibilities of office, the Trump administration continues to be hobbled by policy dissonance and bureaucratic infighting.
To be fair, US President Donald Trump's highly-anticipated summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping went largely according to script. Although there were no specific agreements on thorny issues such as trade and North Korea, both sides agreed to establish new and effective mechanisms for high-level dialogues to properly manage areas of conflict and expand areas of cooperation.
United States National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who replaced Mr Michael Flynn, has played a key role in restoring the National Security Council (NSC) to its more conventional form, booting out ideologues such as former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and restoring Mr Daniel Coats, director of national intelligence, and General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the influential principals committee of the advisory body. The other victim of the McMaster-led shakeup is Ms Kathleen MacFarland, the former No. 2 at the NSC, tipped to become the next ambassador to Singapore.
Nonetheless, a cursory look at Washington politics nowadays reveals a flailing superpower in search of a coherent strategy, particularly in Asia. Both major and smaller regional allies and partners in the region may well worry about strategic neglect under the current American administration.
Meanwhile, China has fortified its position in the South China Sea and stepped up its economic charm offensive across South-east Asia, particularly the Philippines.
Nonetheless, tossing aside its predecessor's pivot to Asia policy, the new US administration has vowed to remain active and engaged in Asia, although under its own formulation.
But almost three months into office, the Trump administration has yet to assemble a full-fledged Asia team, namely the senior officials in the State Department, the National Security Council (NSC) and the Pentagon, who are tasked with formulating, implementing and overseeing America's day-to-day policies in the region. Mr Matthew Pottinger, a veteran China hawk, is widely expected to take over as the chief Asia-focused figure in the NSC.
Partly, this is due to bureaucratic infighting and political vendetta. Both Defence Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have failed to install preferred deputies in the Pentagon and the State Department, respectively, due to fierce opposition from the White House.
For instance, proposed undersecretaries Mary Beth Long (for the Pentagon) and Elliott Abrams (for the State Department) were reportedly turned down by the Trump administration due to their earlier participation in the Never Trump movement, which featured 150 leading Republican national security experts who opposed Mr Trump's candidacy last year.
Other prominent Republicans such as Mr Robert Zoellick (former World Bank president), Mr Tom Ridge (former secretary for Homeland Security) and Mr John Negroponte (former national intelligence director) were similarly frozen out. Dr Patrick Cronin, a widely respected Asia expert who was designated to become the director of the Pentagon-funded Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, reportedly became the latest victim of a seeming political purge of past critics.
The appointment of Asia-focused assistant secretaries has also been affected, given many leading experts' earlier criticism of Mr Trump's campaign agenda. The seeming prioritisation of loyalty over meritocracy could, and already has, left a discernible competence gap in American government.
The other area of concern is policy dissonance. After months of threatening to abandon allies and get tough on China, Mr Trump has ended up reassuring Japan of his ""100 per cent"" support, while repeatedly extending an olive branch to Beijing by emphasising cooperation rather than conflict.
In the South China Sea, the Trump administration initially adopted a tough language, contemplating a naval blockade against China and stepping up so-called freedom-of- navigation operations close to Chinese-made artificial islands in the Paracels and the Spratlys.
As a result, many South-east Asian countries were concerned about unnecessary and dangerous escalation in the maritime disputes. However, latest reports suggest the Pentagon has struggled to get the White House's permission to dispatch, on a more regular basis, larger ships and naval assets close to Chinese-occupied land features in the South China Sea.
However, the biggest area of concern is the prospect of diminished American leadership and optimal strategic engagement.
The US State Department, crucial to development of a nuanced strategy in Asia, is grappling with steep budget cuts of up to 28 per cent alongside personnel reduction, the purging of ambassadors from the Obama administration, and numerous resignations among demoralised members of the diplomatic corps.
As Mr Trump's generals and diplomats have warned, the massive reduction in America's overseas development aid will inevitably have a negative impact on American soft power and conflict-prevention strategy around the globe.
At the same time, China is rolling out major infrastructure projects under its One Belt, One Road and Maritime Silk Road initiatives. The China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, along with the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, are also expected to play crucial roles in bankrolling development projects across Asia with Chinese know-how and technology.
The Philippines, America's oldest ally in Asia, has received a pledge of up to US$50 billion (S$70 billion) from China, which recently sent both its commerce minister and vice-premier to Manila and Davao, the hometown of President Rodrigo Duterte, who has increasingly gravitated towards Beijing and away from Washington.
The Trump administration, which nixed the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) on its first day in office, has put no tangible economic initiative on the table, yet. And it is far from clear whether Mr Trump or any senior American official will meaningfully attend the East Asia Summit and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meeting later this year in the Philippines and Vietnam respectively.
So far, top American officials have been on a series of back-to-back visits to North-east Asia and Europe, but South-east Asia has been left out. Vice-President Mike Pence is slated to visit Indonesia in the coming days, but there are concerns that the trip will be mostly a jet fuel stop and vacuous exercise in handshake diplomacy, with no concrete agreements on the table.
While one can argue that it's still too early to judge the merits of Mr Trump's Asia policy, the first months have been far from encouraging. In the highly dynamic world of Asian geopolitics, time and initiative is of essence.

"," Without the late founding father Othman Wok, Singapore would be a vastly different country, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said yesterday.
""His guts, the courage he gave the Malay community and the confidence in multiracialism that he gave all Singaporeans, the confidence that we could make it work - that's what we are in debt to him for,"" he told reporters at Mr Othman's wake in his Bedok home.
Amid racial tensions, Mr Othman ""rose to the occasion, decided that his belief in unity was worth fighting for, and hitched his wagon to Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore became what it is.""
""So we're grateful to him for making that difference and making this country,"" Mr Tharman said.
Mr Othman, who held portfolios in social affairs and culture, died at Singapore General Hospital yesterday at 12.21pm. He was 92.
Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim had also lauded Mr Othman as a multiracial icon who united people of different racial and religious backgrounds during the political upheavals of Singapore's early days.
MAN OF INTEGRITY
He was among the first Malay leaders of the PAP. He contributed significantly to the PAP's multiracial platform. We worked closely in the early years of the PAP. I was the party's organising secretary and Othman, who was then a journalist with Utusan Melayu, was our unofficial Malay translator. I would see him whenever we needed Malay translations for Petir and other publications. Othman always obliged.
I will always remember Othman to be a man of integrity and with absolute loyalty to the PAP and Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
He was also a man of high EQ, who always had kind words for his Cabinet colleagues, his grassroots workers and friends, and the man in the street.
MR ONG PANG BOON, one of two remaining members of independent Singapore's first Cabinet. The other is Mr Jek Yeun Thong.
The pioneer Cabinet minister had seen through ""some of the extremist forces that were at play at that time, and realised that a better future lay for Singapore in a society where we respect one another"", he said.
""He fought for what he believed was right, not only for the Malays in Singapore but (also) the whole of Singapore,"" said Dr Yaacob, who is also the Minister for Communications and Information.
This was a ""courageous act"" because Mr Othman was ""going against very, very strong forces, which we saw in the extremist Malay nationalists"", he added.
Dr Yaacob also said that Mr Othman had laid the foundation for a ""modern and progressive Malay-Muslim community"".
He helped to develop the Administration of Muslim Law Act, laws passed in 1966 to enhance the administration of Islamic law in the Singapore legal system.
This, in turn, helped to create the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) which, with the Syariah Court, are key institutions today that let Muslims in Singapore ""lead a vibrant socio-religious life"", said Dr Yaacob.
On a personal note, Dr Yaacob said he remembered Mr Othman best for the way he balanced his dual roles as a community leader and a national leader.
""In both roles, he brought to bear the ethos that has been associated with him and the founding generation: That of respect for multiracialism, respect for meritocracy, and respect for a society in which every community in Singapore has a space to thrive,"" he said.
Former senior minister of state Zainul Abidin Rasheed told The Straits Times that Mr Othman's position as a top Malay politician against the backdrop of heated race politics was ""all the more poignant"".
Mr Zainul, who is helping to coordinate funeral arrangements between the Government and the late leader's family, said Mr Othman, like the late president Yusof Ishak, had always been clear about working towards multi-culturalism for Singapore. ""Even when Mr Othman was a journalist, he understood the challenges of the community, and he wanted to help it understand what Singapore was trying to achieve,"" he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who attended the wake later at night, said on Facebook that Mr Othman ""stood up for an independent multiracial Singapore and helped lay the foundations for the peaceful and harmonious Singapore of today"".
He added: ""His unwavering commitment and loyalty to Singapore and the principles we stand for are an inspiration to all of us.""

"," As a young boy, Mr Yusof Ishak wanted to be a judge. But his family could not afford to send him to England to study law.
So he imagined becoming a raja, or king, instead, his son Imran Yusof recalls in a new book on his father, who became Singapore's head of state and its first president.
In both roles, he felt he could ensure justice, said Dr Imran, who works at a hospital in Brunei. ""He was concerned about justice. A judge metes out justice, likewise a raja should be someone who is in charge and who puts things right.""
He added: ""(My father) felt that the Malay leaders of the time were dissociated from common people.""
This story and other deeply personal details of Mr Yusof's life are featured in a 126-page coffee-table book by ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute deputy director Ooi Kee Beng.
Titled Yusof Ishak: A Man Of Many Firsts, it was launched at the think-tank yesterday, at a seminar where Malaysian academic Ahmad Murad Merican - part of Mr Yusof's extended family - spoke on the evolution of Malay journalism in Singapore, and the influence of Utusan Melayu, the newspaper Mr Yusof founded.
IMPORTANT RELEVANCE
Writing a biography about leaders from the 1960s... is most important for what they tell present and future generations about the times and the historical context in which they functioned.''
DR OOI KEE BENG, deputy director of ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, who penned Mr Yusof Ishak's biography.
The book has more than 100 photos of Mr Yusof and chronicles his life story, from being the son of a civil servant to head of state who would steer Singapore through formative moments of its nationhood.
It also offers little-known snippets about the man, gleaned from interviews with Dr Imran and Mr Yusof's widow, Puan Noor Aishah.
Mr Yusof, for instance, was an avid reader of the works of humorist P.G. Wodehouse. He also listened to Beethoven at home, alongside Malay classics like Dondang Sayang, or love ballads.
Dr Imran also revealed that his father suffered from tuberculosis for most of his adult life, and was a heavy smoker who managed to kick the habit only when he moved into the Istana. These put a great strain on Mr Yusof; he had his first heart failure in 1965 and suffered a few more scares in the years after. Five years later, he died of heart failure in office, at the age of 60.
While Mr Yusof's lasting legacy is that of president of a fledgling multiracial nation, he dedicated most of his life to Utusan Melayu, a Malay-language newspaper that reflected his firm belief in meritocracy and multiculturalism while he remained at its helm.
He was so consumed by his work that, at 39, he was still a bachelor, having rebuffed attempts at matchmaking by friends and colleagues.
When close friends finally convinced him to take a look at photos of potential brides, a glimpse of 16-year-old Noor Aishah was all it took to convince him to travel to Penang, where her family lived.
Puan Noor Aishah recalls in the book that when the newlyweds moved into their first home - in Jalan Ishak, named after Mr Yusof's father, a prominent resident there - it had no piped water or electricity.
After two decades helming Utusan Melayu, Mr Yusof left the paper in 1959, after members of Umno, which wanted special privileges for Malays - a concept Mr Yusof did not believe in - began buying up the bulk of its shares.
He moved to Perak, where he sold orchids, but was eventually persuaded to return by Singapore's founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, who first met Mr Yusof when he represented the paper in a case.
In July 1959, Mr Yusof was made chairman of the Public Service Commission. Later that year, he was appointed Yang di-Pertuan Negara, and served two terms as president after Singapore gained independence in 1965. He would play a crucial part in helping to restore the trust of Singaporeans who lived through events such as the 1964 racial riots.
Mr Yusof longed for social equality, and would impress upon his children the value of meritocracy.
Dr Imran recounted: ""Every so often he would remind me: 'Everyone should be treated equally. Whatever the colour of one's skin, one should be judged on merit, never on skin colour, race or religion. Anything else is unjust.'""
Dr Ooi said he was struck by Mr Yusof's sense of integrity, pointing out how he decided to leave his life's work rather than be an Umno lackey. He added: ""Writing a biography about leaders from the 1960s... is most important for what they tell present and future generations about the times and the historical context in which they functioned.""

"," Singapore and China are very different in size but they face common challenges, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said yesterday.
These include an ageing population, slowing workforce growth, a better-educated younger generation with higher expectations for career and family, and the impact of technology on society and work.
In the search for solutions, government officials from both countries came together to share ideas and experiences at a two-day forum, which ends today. It is being held at the Shangri-La Hotel.
Central to the discussion was how to develop leaders and policies for their countries to find innovative ways forward - the theme of the 6th Singapore-China Forum on Leadership.
The Singapore side is led by Mr Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister-in-charge of the Civil Service, and China by Mr Zhao Leji, Communist Party of China (CPC) Politburo member and Central Committee Organisation Department Minister.
In their keynote speeches, both spoke of the friendship between their countries and the importance of leadership development.
Mr Teo said: ""The ability to have deep, wide-ranging and substantive discussions on such issues of national interest reflects the high degree of mutual trust between Singapore and China, as well as the depth, breadth and strength of our bilateral ties.""
Similarly, Mr Zhao spoke of the longstanding friendship between both nations, which also share a consensus on the development of human resources.
""We are in a volatile time and the world is undergoing rapid changes, (and) neighbours wish each other well, just as loved ones do to each other,"" he told about 100 people.
As co-chairs of the forum, both leaders outlined how their people are being developed for the future.
Mr Teo said Singapore's innovative ways include broadening the concept of meritocracy to help people learn throughout their lives. This is to prepare them for new jobs and industries as technological advances, such as robots and artificial intelligence, disrupt routine jobs.
Singapore is also systematically deepening and broadening the experiences of a younger generation of political leaders, he added.
""We will need leaders at all levels, in the political arena and public administration, in the private and people sectors. Leaders who have the moral courage and integrity to do what is right, and not just what is populist,"" he said.
Mr Zhao said the development of human resources is the foundation of innovation and, in turn, growth.
Their governments also innovate.
Mr Teo said Singapore takes the long view in developing policies, which it adapts and improves along the way. To produce clean water, for instance, it looks for new methods to gradually reduce its dependence on water from Malaysia.
In implementing policies, the Government has made two changes: Services are more citizen-centric, like the automated tax return filing that makes it easy for people to pay taxes, and encouraging more ground-up initiatives.
In short, it has shifted from a ""Government to people'' to a ""Government with people'' approach.
Mr Teo said: ""It recognises the Government may not have the answers to all issues, empowers citizens and promotes collective responsibility and ownership.''
China's focus is on the central ideology of socialism adapted to China's conditions, said Mr Zhao.
""Not all people should wear shoes of the same size... Similarly, not all governments should adopt the same model of governance. They should govern in ways that benefit their people,"" he added.
Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) Ong Ye Kung noted the similarities between Singapore and China, including being oriental countries.
""But besides Chinese culture and tradition, the Malay and Indian cultures, traditions and wisdom are also deeply ingrained in Singaporeans' collective consciousness.""
He also said their difference in size means Singapore can be more flexible in trying out various solutions, and learn and improve if these do not work.
CPC Central Committee Organisation Department Vice-Minister Gao Xuanmin said both countries' ruling parties led the way in promoting innovation and development.
Earlier in the day, Mr Zhao visited the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and was hosted to lunch by Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, who is the school's chairman.

"," Singapore may be small but with new technology, it can shape a future that transcends its physical size and enlarges its identity, the former head of the civil service, Mr Peter Ho, said yesterday.
Citing three countries that have re-invented themselves in the digital age, he urged Singaporeans to adopt a more hopeful view to balance the prevailing attitude that Singapore is a price-taker.
He made the call in his last lecture as the Institute of Policy Studies' S R Nathan Fellow for the Study of Singapore. The lecture series explores Singapore's future.
Ideas that can inspire Singapore exist in Estonia, Denmark and Luxembourg, Mr Ho said.
Estonia, with 1.3 million people, introduced e-residency. It now has 18,000 such residents who are not citizens of Estonia, but they can set up companies based in the Baltic nation.
This scheme helps Estonia generate business for its companies, from independent contractors to small companies with clients worldwide.
Denmark, with 5.7 million people, is mulling the creation of a Silicon Valley Ambassador to better engage digital companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook.
""This is almost as if technology was its own country, unlike the present,"" said Mr Ho. The idea is for the ambassador to work with big companies on issues such as privacy and fake news, and perhaps influence their positions.
Luxembourg, with fewer than 600,000 people, is creating a market by letting companies own resources obtained from space.
These are ideas to consider, Mr Ho told officials and students at the National University of Singapore.
Singapore does not have to be at the mercy of forces which it thinks are beyond its control. ""Because we are a small country, we often speak as if the future is a car speeding towards us - we can swerve, or we can run backwards. But we cannot control the car.""
However, ""even small city-states can influence, shape, and even create, not just markets but also their operating environment"", he said.
Mr Ho gave two reasons for his optimism. First, Singapore can experiment with policies and roll them out more easily because it is small. It can also correct its course quickly if a policy was wrong or misguided.
Second, Singapore has experience in responding to complexity and uncertainty, and can draw on it. As a newly independent nation, it eschewed import substitution, courted multinational corporations and chose multicultural meritocracy when its neighbours were going for the opposite.
But Singapore has to have the courage to seize this hope and reinvent itself, added Mr Ho, who is now a senior adviser at think-tank Centre for Strategic Futures.
""Just as Sir Stamford Raffles made Singapore a free port in 1819, welcoming traders from any country, Singapore in 2017 could welcome data from any country - a free data port,"" he said.
It could allow data centres in Singapore to hold data governed by the laws of another country, as if it was stored in the source country. This would allow local-based companies to harness insights from the data, he added.
Mr Ho noted that Estonia's e-residency hints at what it means to be a nation in a digital era. Quoting an Estonian official, he said: ""Land is so yesterday. It doesn't matter where you physically live or operate. That is how the game will change.''
But a ""virtual nation"" faces the perennial threat of cyber attacks. To withstand them, Estonia is experimenting with ""digital embassies'', where data is stored on servers in its embassies abroad.
Despite the risks, re-invention in the digital age is vital for the long-term survival of global hubs like Singapore. This is because changes in technology, trade routes and geopolitics can gradually diminish a country's position as a global hub, said Mr Ho.

"," Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia has hit back at an editorial by newspaper Utusan Malaysia on changes to Singapore's elected presidency, saying it made several ""baseless and mischievous allegations"".
These include the claims that in Singapore, ""meritocracy was always being used as an excuse to discriminate against Malays"", that ""meritocracy was also open to manipulation"" and that ""Malays became weaker and marginalised from the corridors of power"", wrote Singapore envoy Vanu Gopala Menon in a letter to the Malay-language daily.
The letter was published yesterday on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
The newspaper's editors, writing under the pseudonym Awang Selamat, had praised the move to reserve this year's presidential election for Malay candidates.
The editorial, published on Sunday, then noted that some parties, including former presidential candidate Tan Cheng Bock, have opposed the move.
It went on to comment on meritocracy in Singapore.
Mr Menon wrote that he wanted to ""set the record straight"". He said meritocracy is a key pillar of Singapore's system of governance, and Singaporeans have equal opportunities, regardless of race, language or religion.
He added that Singapore's Malay community has made significant social and economic progress in the past five decades because of its efforts in a fair and just society, not because of privileges given.
""Singapore's meritocratic system has never been 'manipulated' or 'used as an excuse to discriminate' against Singapore's Malay community, or any other community,"" he said.

I consider myself a liberal, so it's funny (or not) that in our house, I'm the one who's thought of as the closet conservative. The kids don't think I can be relied on not to make some off-colour remark in the presence of very correct millennials.
They're constantly on tenterhooks, in case I start arguing that Eminem did not appropriate rap culture, but is an artist in his own right - hey, we all draw on influences - or go on about how I see no problem with teens dressing up as Pocahontas for Halloween because there's no need to get so worked up about trick or treat.
So, I might have rolled my eyes once or twice and suddenly, I'm the enemy?
But I'll admit - I've been allergic to political correctness since the term surfaced in the mainstream media in the 1990s.
It was used disparagingly to describe progressive trends, for instance those that expanded curricula in universities to include ""less rigorous"" academic fields, such as women's or gay and lesbian studies.
Before long, PC became associated with liberal bias, an intolerance of speech and action, however innocent, that could smack of bigotry towards any disadvantaged group. Liberal fascism, as one pundit called it.
By and large, however, this was a Western trend. We were, for the most part, spared in Singapore. In fact, we were nothing if not refreshingly old-fashioned. Maybe Asian children learn to grow thick skins, but whatever the reason, we had very different attitudes towards social interaction.
Stereotypes were seen as basically benign and, really, the onus was on the individual not to overreact to perceived slights.
Of course, we had our own boundaries, but the scope was far narrower.
As for me, I disliked intolerance of any sort. What's more, I would say, pithily, if you call yourself a liberal, then be liberal.
In recent months, I have found myself saying just that to the new champions of political correctness, some of whom live in my house.
As millennials became alive to the social injustices that still persist, making lip service of phrases like equal opportunity and meritocracy, campaigns such as Black Lives Matter turned urban centres and American universities into battlefields, this time with law enforcement and university administrations on the wrong side of the Them vs Us equation.
Reams have been written about the PC minefields of college campuses and the new vocabulary of ""trigger warnings"" (alerts before any presentation or lecture of potentially distressing material), ""microaggressions"" (small everyday slights or actions that can be construed as demeaning) and ""privilege"" (the inherent advantages enjoyed by dominant groups).
I have traded stories with friends about the arguments we are constantly having with our kids, less about larger issues such as race than the more subtle implications embodied by the new nomenclature. We, the grown-ups, would plead for wiggle room in their uncompromising view of the world. They would stubbornly refuse to budge.
A friend, driving her three daughters to their elite university in the north-east part of the United States, overheard the two who were already enrolled giving the third a tutorial on how to address someone of indeterminate sex. You shouldn't call the person ""he"" or ""she"" but ""they"", they coached. Suddenly, the eldest shouted from the back: ""Stop it, mum! I can see you rolling your eyes in the rear view mirror!""
Have we felt judged? Definitely. Are they irritatingly sanctimonious? On occasion, no question about it.
But when I take a step back (out of the line of fire) and listen to what these millennials are actually saying, I find little to object to in their zeal to fight for the rights of the underserved.
Take the difference between he, she and the non-binary they.
On issues of gender, I'm the one who still has some catching up to do.
While sex is the biological anatomy we are each born with, gender - that is, masculine and feminine identity and roles - is a social construct.
One's gender identity usually follows one's sex, so girls tend to be feminine and boys masculine, but that is not the case for everyone. Caitlyn Jenner is only one of the most famous people who had to live for years with the mismatch between biological sex and gender identity.
And as barriers have and continue to be torn down in areas such as minority and women's rights, why should the social barriers of gender be set in stone?
As my kids see it, the world is made up of cisgender people, who identify with their biological sex; transgender people, who do not; genderqueer people, who are neither; and people of other permutations too many to enumerate. You alone should decide who you are.
I believe it is such willingness and capacity to accept and accommodate differences as equal, whether in the colour of our skin, our gender or orientation, thathave always shown the way forward for us as a species.
For those of my generation, political correctness has always implied a kind of liberal posturing. For many in this new generation, it actually is a moral code to live by, which points the way on issues spanning civil rights to environmental protection to identity.
But there is a problem when a code becomes so codified that dissent is no longer tolerated.
Former Yale professor William Deresiewicz says some select private colleges are becoming ""religious schools"", where the religion is an unwavering faith in the liberal belief system and any other belief system is blocked.
There have been violent examples of what can happen to people with different points of view.
In March, conservative scholar Charles Murray, author of The Bell Curve (1994), was invited to speak about a new book at Middlebury, a college in Vermont. He had to be rushed to safety after an angry mob threatened to break up the session. The professor who had invited him, Allison Stanger, had her hair pulled and suffered whiplash.
Much scorn has been heaped on the student protesters. But some, including Dr Stanger, have taken a step back to parse how and why it had all happened.
First, it was a minority of students, albeit an energetic one, who had been disruptive. Second, this was coming after a bruising election in which the candidate Donald Trump had dismissed progressive policies as mere political correctness and energised white nationalist groups, of which Murray was wrongly seen as a member.
The students wanted to protest against his being there on behalf of oppressed minorities, but it was all a powder keg of emotions that blew up.
When emotions such as anger and hate overtake reason, we cease to see one another as human beings.
I don't think of political correctness anymore as liberal intolerance and, funnily enough, United States President Trump had a hand in this turnaround.
As he scoffed, I saw it as this: that those of us in the privileged majority have a duty to look out for the rest. We give voice to those without a voice, a hand to those who need one and we do not say or do anything to our fellowmen who are minorities that can be construed as oppression. We don't guard our positions jealously because when everyone benefits, everyone benefits.
That is righteous. But you have to look past the hotheads, the anger and, let's face it, the hatred, sometimes, to see it. There are still barriers to come down and in today's politically incorrect climate, I'm afraid that's a tall order.

"," Torn over whether to report a family member who is radicalised? People often have mixed feelings about an issue or decision. In this guide to navigating ambivalence, a psychology professor says understanding Goals, Insights, Values and Expectations can help you tackle the dilemma.
Human beings are complex creatures; most of us do not have monolithic feelings, but have mixed feelings and thoughts about someone or something. We can see both positive and negative traits in a person or action, in our personal lives and at work. When it comes to our reactions to public events, a public leader or a public policy, our feelings and responses often form an ambivalent cauldron.
Consider some examples: We both like and dislike certain traits of our spouse, business partner or friend. When we make a decision on our work or lifestyle (say, start work earlier so you can go home earlier), we are likely to have both positive and negative feelings about it.
The conflict between the positive and negative is also salient when we experience moral dilemmas, such as whether to report wrongdoing or flag suspicious actions by someone close to us.
Then there are those times when a leader we respect says something we disagree with, or a political party we support advocates a position that is against what we believe ought to be.
It is common for people to have mixed feelings and thoughts in their reactions to policy debates and public discourse, such as over immigration, changes to the Elected Presidency and perceptions of relations between Singapore and China.
The experience of mixed feelings and thoughts, or what psychologists call ""ambivalence"", is a state of internal conflict.
<figcaption>ST ILLUSTRATION : MANNY FRANCISCO</figcaption>
We are unable, or find it very difficult, to choose between two opposing actions, to arrive at a decision, to decide to approach or avoid someone, or to speak up for or against a person or position.
If we understand the conflicts in the psychological state of ambivalence, we will be more likely to resolve our own ambivalence as well as respond to others' ambivalence more effectively.Conflicts in ambivalence
People, decisions and actions have both positive and negative features. When we feel ambivalent, we recognise the pros and the cons.
But being in ambivalence is psychologically discomforting - you have strong feelings and thoughts that are opposing. You can see the two contrasting sides, and you are unsure what to feel, think or do about it.
Rather than sitting on the fence, it is more like being in the middle of a ""tug-of-war"". It is not feeling neutral towards two opposing positions. It is feeling ""torn between"". Ambivalence is a state of active conflict, and not passive indifference.
The quick way to get out of the discomforting state is to just take one position and reject the other. Thus, when people experience ambivalence, they are eager to take a position and reinforce it. This makes them susceptible to cognitive biases and emotion-based influences. They become more vulnerable to self-confirmation and persuasion by others. When the position taken is inconsistent with the facts, or inadequate to address the future, it becomes maladaptive.
To deal with ambivalence, we must understand its conflicting nature. There are three main types of conflicts.MOTIVATIONAL CONFLICTS
Ambivalence occurs when two different motivations pull a decision in opposite directions. Should you seek out a sumptuous meal? For many, the enjoyment of eating and losing weight are often two opposing motivations relating to the decision.
Motivational conflicts also exist in social and economic situations. For example, someone may feel conflicted about what to spend time on when he is highly motivated to both pursue his career and help others in need.
Another example is what to do with our money when pulled by motivations to spend on ourselves versus donate to others, or spend on what we want now versus save for our future needs.BELIEF CONFLICTS
We hold certain beliefs about specific individuals, and also specific groups. The beliefs that matter most are those related to integrity, competence and benevolence in intention.
Our beliefs about a person could be based on empirical evidence, our own encounters and experiences, opinions of others or salient stereotypes. Regardless of how they were formed, we want our various beliefs about the same person or group to be internally consistent.
We have a human need for coherence of thought, even though we are not always coherent in our arguments or consistent when taking positions.
We see positive traits as consistent with each other but not with negative traits, and conversely we see the same for negative traits. Which is why seeing a mix of positive and negative traits in the same person or group leads to a belief ambivalence.
Belief conflict also occurs when there is inconsistency between what a person or group practises and preaches. The effect is especially potent when the issue touches on core values such as integrity and impartiality, or fairness and meritocracy.
Belief conflicts are powerful cognitions that guide the way we think, feel and act towards others, and subsequently our trust in them.EMOTIONAL CONFLICTS
Ambivalence is most felt when we experience strong emotions that are incompatible - love and anger towards someone we care about, or respect for and disappointment with the leaders we support.
Emotional conflicts can also involve uncertainty and social needs. For example, we may simultaneously experience hope for success and fear of failure, or the need to express our view and pressure to conform to a contrary view adopted by the group that we belong to.
The impact of emotional conflict is relevant in the current security situation related to terrorism. With more attacks undertaken not by militant outsiders but by radicalised citizens within industrialised societies, law enforcement agencies, including in Singapore, are urging family and community members to be on the lookout for people who might be radicalised by errant Islamic teachings and tempted to take up violent action.
This places family members and close friends of a radicalised individual in a difficult situation. They will experience strong emotional conflicts when they have to decide whether to report the person to security agencies. They are torn between feelings of loyalty to kinship or friendship and feelings of responsibility to society.
When people are in emotional ambivalence, their feelings dominate and override any rational thinking. That is why the security message needs to go beyond telling families and friends to be vigilant to detect signs of radicalisation in an individual.
We need to highlight the severity of the consequences involved if a lone radicalised individual launches an attack; help them anticipate the regret they will feel from not reporting, if that attack were to take place; and focus on the positive difference that they will make by reporting.Resolving ambivalence
To resolve ambivalence, focus on what can drive the way we think, feel and act. I suggest we focus on goals, insights, values and expectations.GOALS
When conflicted by competing emotions or opposing motivations, ask what the goals that we really want to achieve are. When goals are clarified, some of the positives and negatives in the mix may change in their relevance and impact. Also consider how goals are related to one another. If the goals are contradictory, we need to prioritise, coordinate, choose or make trade-offs. But if they are actually common or at least not mutually exclusive, we can connect them to converge or complement one another.INSIGHTS
Learn and apply the insights on ambivalence. This involves understanding our motivations and regulating our emotions. Be more aware of our beliefs and biases, including the basis of a belief and evaluating its validity.
We can also gain new insights when we examine issues in context and find out facts objectively, instead of selecting information that confirms existing beliefs and preconceived positions. Consult those who are knowledgeable in the relevant area and can be trusted to tell the truth.VALUES
Values represent our convictions of what is important and they remind us of what ought to be. They shape our attitudes, affect our thoughts, influence our emotions and guide our behaviours.
Values are critical when we are emotionally conflicted. Our emotions may contest our rationality. But our emotions are often influenced by our values, and they can change to align with our value system.
To reduce and resolve the various conflicts in ambivalence, put these core values at the centre of what we think, feel and act. This means cherishing character traits of integrity and impartiality, creating a fair and just society, cultivating communities to build a cohesive society, and caring for our country and fellow citizens.EXPECTATIONS
Expectations are what we hope or desire to happen; and what we believe can and will likely happen. The positive effects of met expectations on physical and psychological well-being, as well as trust and relationship-building, are well-established. This is conversely true about the negative effects of unmet expectations.
To resolve ambivalence, evaluate if the positives and negatives are based on realistic expectations. If they are not, recalibrate so that expectations become more likely to be met than unmet. When expectations are realistic, they are also less likely to be extremely positive or negative. This in turn reduces the intensity of ambivalence.
Information also shapes expectations. When relevant information is not available, or when false information is accepted as true, people will understandably have a wrong or limited perspective and form unrealistic expectations about an issue.
We need to make the effort to search for relevant information and verify facts. On the part of those who hold the information, share more data to engender more realistic and well-informed expectations.
Mixed feelings and thoughts about people, decisions and actions are natural, and they occur often. We should not trivialise them, nor be overwhelmed by the sense of conflict between the positives and negatives. Instead, we can reflect on the conflicts and resolve them. Adopt the ""GIVE"" approach - clarify the goals, capitalise on the insights, centre on our values, and calibrate our expectations.
Ambivalence can be adaptive or maladaptive. Pause to understand the mixed feelings and thoughts. Prevent stirring the pot of negativity. Promote spreading the nuggets of positivity.
We can address ambivalence in ways that benefit self and others, personal and work lives, leadership and teamwork, policy formulation and implementation, and even community relations and social cohesion.David Chan is director of the Behavioural Sciences Institute and professor of psychology at the Singapore Management University.

"," Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has refuted allegations by his siblings that he had misused his power in relation to their late father's house, saying he was disappointed and sad they had chosen to air a private family matter in public.
""I am deeply saddened by the unfortunate allegations that they have made. Ho Ching and I deny these allegations, especially the absurd claim that I have political ambitions for my son,"" PM Lee said in response to a six-page statement his two siblings issued yesterday.
Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang had said they had lost confidence in their brother, PM Lee, adding that they feared the use of state organs against them.
Mr Lee Hsien Yang said he and his wife Suet Fern felt compelled to leave Singapore ""for the foreseeable future"" because of this.
Titled ""What has happened to Lee Kuan Yew's values?"", their statement is the latest development in a long-running dispute over the demolition of their father's house at 38, Oxley Road.
The two siblings are joint executors and trustees of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew's estate, and have pushed for the Government to honour his wish, as stated in his will, for the house to be pulled down.
They alleged that PM Lee and his wife wanted the house preserved for their own political gain, adding that the PM had abused his position to drive his personal agenda. They further alleged Mrs Lee had outsized influence and power that went beyond her role as the PM's wife.
PM Lee said: ""While siblings may have differences, I believe that any such differences should stay in the family. Since my father's passing in March 2015, as the eldest son, I have tried my best to resolve the issues among us within the family, out of respect for our parents.""
He added: ""My siblings' statement has hurt our father's legacy.""
After the statement was publicised on the duo's Facebook pages around 2am, it was widely shared online and picked up by media.
The news also sparked talk in the legal fraternity about possible changes at law firm Morgan Lewis Stamford, at which Mrs Lee Suet Fern is managing partner.
Last year, Dr Lee had also called PM Lee a ""dishonourable son"" in a Facebook post, because of their disagreement over the house.
This time, she and Mr Lee Hsien Yang said PM Lee and his wife had opposed their father's wish for the house to be pulled down, as ""the preservation of the house would enhance his political capital"".
In December 2015, PM Lee had said in a joint statement with his siblings that he hoped their father's wish would be honoured, adding that he would recuse himself from all government decisions on the house. The Government also said it would not make any decision on the house as long as Dr Lee resided there.
Mr Lee Hsien Yang told The Straits Times that PM Lee had not kept his promise, citing the formation of a ministerial committee on the house. To him, this was a sign of PM Lee's interference.
But Cabinet Secretary Tan Kee Yong said in a statement the committee was formed to consider options for the house and their implications.
He also said PM Lee ""has not been involved in Cabinet's discussions concerning this committee. As he had previously stated, he has recused himself from all government decisions (on) the house.""
The committee was also looking into how the late Mr Lee's will was prepared, and the role Mrs Lee Suet Fern and lawyers in her legal firm played in preparing it, Mr Tan said.
The two siblings also alleged PM Lee and his wife harbour political ambitions for their son Hongyi. PM Lee called it an ""absurd claim"".
He said: ""I will do my utmost to continue to do right by my parents. At the same time, I will continue serving Singaporeans honestly and to the best of my ability. In particular, that means upholding meritocracy, which is a fundamental value of our society.""
He ended his statement saying: ""As my siblings know, I am presently overseas on leave with my family. I will consider this matter further after I return this weekend.""

"," When it comes to decisions about 38, Oxley Road, more emotional aspects of heritage and memory will also have to be taken into account by the ministerial committee, Nominated MP Kok Heng Leun said yesterday.
""The loss of our national heritage, whether the National Library, National Theatre, dragon playground or the Bukit Brown cemetery can be very emotional, affecting not just the minds, but the heart and soul of the people involved,"" said Mr Kok, noting that past decisions had often favoured pragmatism over idealism, and society simply had to accept them and move on.
Thus, he was ""very glad"" to hear Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean's acknowledgement, in his statement on the ministerial committee, that the Government may have been overzealous in demolishing buildings and carrying out development works in the past.
But unlike public spaces like the National Library and Bukit Brown, 38, Oxley Road poses a different question, Mr Kok told Parliament.
""Now we have a private estate which the community believes to hold a lot of historical value. How do we then balance the needs of the individual as well as the state?"" he asked, calling for a decision on its fate to be made with ""wisdom and clarity"".
Nominated MP Mahdev Mohan added that as the issue is one of public interest, the Government should give Singaporeans a chance to have their say through a public consultation process.
Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir SMC) noted that Mr Lee Kuan Yew was the founding prime minister of a country post-independence, not unlike India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, or Mao Zedong. His place in the nation's history should not be forgotten, he said.
The values that the late Mr Lee stood for - including multiculturalism, meritocracy, good governance, and rule of law - are representative of Singapore's values, and should be passed on to younger generations, said Mr Sitoh.
While preserving the Oxley Road estate is not the only, or best, way of doing so, he argued that it is ""reasonable, logical and legal"" for the Government to set up a ministerial committee to consider the possibility of preserving his home.
But Nominated MP Kuik Shiao-Yin said that Singapore is ""bigger than Mr Lee Kuan Yew's values"", and suggested that decisions on the Oxley estate can take their cue from the findings of the 15-member Founders' Memorial Committee, on which she has been serving since 2015.
The committee gathered views from thousands of Singaporeans about what kind of memorial would best honour the legacy of Mr Lee and the first generation of political leaders.
Incidentally, the Oxley house never came up as a major suggestion, she said.
Singaporeans talked of ""far more public"" spaces like Fort Canning Park or the Singapore River.
""What we learnt is that many Singaporeans wanted a memorial that would go beyond mere recollection of the past... I imagine whatever Singaporeans wanted for the Founders' Memorial, they would want for the Oxley house as well,"" she said.
""So whether Oxley stays or goes or becomes a memorial garden with a basement, I hope that there will be some compromise that will enable it to not go down in history as a memorial born in bitterness.""

"," Based on the infrastructural requirements of the 2014 Fifa World Cup in Brazil, I am confident that South-east Asia's two most developed economies - Malaysia and Singapore - can jointly mount and host a successful tournament in 2034 (Singapore will explore joint World Cup bid; July 7).
There are enough 40,000-capacity stadiums between the two neighbours to meet Fifa's qualifying standards. Johor is reportedly planning a new one as well.
If need be, the floating platform at Marina Bay can be upsized and refurbished to host what may be the first World Cup game in such a venue.
With the Singapore -Kuala Lumpur high-speed rail up and running by 2034, in addition to the expansion of Malaysia's domestic train network, transport and logistics should be a breeze.
However, as the number of teams participating in the 2034 Fifa World Cup will increase to 48 from the current 32, Indonesia's initiative to spearhead a joint Asean bid is timely. In fact, Thailand should be roped in as well.
A World Cup hosted by four out of the five founding Asean member nations would be most meaningful for the organisation.
All are football-crazy nations, with solid tourism facilities to boot.
But given the more complex transport and logistical challenges and the costs, the organisers should seek to deliver a budget-friendlier tournament by centring it on those countries with ready and compact infrastructure to facilitate movement for the teams and their fans.
Malaysia and Singapore stand out in this regard, with Greater Jakarta and Greater Bangkok adding to the mix, ensuring that travel time between facilities will not be more than three hours by air, rail and road.
The luck of the draw should be used to decide which of these countries will host the prestigious opening and final matches, as well as the third or fourth play-off.
Team-wise, Asean should be represented by its top national teams according to the outcomes of the SEA Games and Asean Football Championship, as opposed to the traditional route of automatic entry for the hosts.
This will ensure that only the best represent the region, as well as foster regional inclusivity and solidarity based on meritocracy.
Currently, not a single national team from South-east Asia ranks in the Fifa top 100.
We have a lot of catching up to do.

"," When Kimaya Bhuta was about eight years old, she told her parents she wanted to apply to the School of the Arts (Sota), Singapore's only national pre-tertiary specialised arts school, which she had heard about from her friends.
Recalling how she had enjoyed school concerts in kindergarten, where she danced, as well as hosted and sang in Hindi and English, her parents started looking for enrichment classes in the performing arts.
Last year, when she was in Primary 4 at Tanjong Katong Primary School, Kimaya, 10, enrolled in the Direct School Admission (DSA) preparatory course at Kids Performing Academy Of The Arts, where she engages in activities such as improvisation and duologues in weekly group lessons.
Her father, Mr Devang Bhuta, 41, who works in banking, says: ""Initially, the idea was to give her exposure to theatre. We didn't realise that the children would have to build a portfolio.""
To apply for admission to Sota, all candidates must go through a selection process that includes a portfolio review, an audition and an interview.
Preparatory courses such as the one Kimaya is taking, offered by some enrichment centres, help children prepare for application to Sota, which offers a six-year integrated arts and academic curriculum based on the International Baccalaureate, and also to other secondary schools that emphasise the arts.
Fees for Kids Performing's direct admission programme, for upper primary pupils, range from $160 to $240 a session, which lasts up to three hours. A year's fees range from $6,400 to $9,600.
Some say such enrichment classes are another example of how the children of parents who are able to afford the fees have an advantage over those in poorer households when entering top schools.
Sota's enrolment is capped at 200 places a year. Every year, for each spot available, there are usually four to five applicants vying for entry, according to figures provided by the school.
Dr Paulin Straughan, a sociologist at Singapore Management University, says: ""Parents may not have enough confidence that the selection criterion is robust enough to see through the frills, that (the school) is able to tease out raw talent from the packaged product.""
She says the application should be one that a 12-year-old child is able to put together.
There are no easy answers to concerns about meritocracy, she adds.
While an enrichment system that disadvantages those with less resources is not desirable, ""neither do we want to disadvantage kids whose parents are able to nurture their talent"", she says.
Moreover, Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist at National University of Singapore, says prep classes can help a child improve his portfolio, but the lack of genuine talent cannot be papered over by taking preparatory classes.
""For those with neither the potential and talent, nor the passion, I doubt preparatory work would be helpful. A sharp assessor would be able to detect the lack of creativity in the works submitted.""
Rukshana Driver, 16, took a preparatory class for Sota, which she says ""widened her skill set"". While she is now a Year 4 student at Sota, she says her interest in visual arts was always driven by herself.
""I started at five and really liked it. At the age of 11, I found out about Sota and wanted to apply,"" she says.
Mrs Shalini Kapoor, director of Little Artists Art Studio, noticed that Rukshana had ""highly aesthetic colour combinations"" when she was a pre-schooler attending an art class at Mrs Kapoor's studio.
She also taught Rukshana techniques such as how to apply quick-drying plaster of Paris for sculpting during the girl's preparatory class at the age of about 11.
At the studio, preparatory classes for upper primary pupils start at about $200 a month.
Some parents and children say preparatory enrichment classes for youngsters aiming to apply to Sota in Primary 6 offer benefits, such as the child becoming more confident, as well a targeted approach in the highly competitive process of applying to Sota.
Performing arts academies such as Kids Performing are also places casting agents go to when they are looking for child actors.
Ms Linette Lim, 44, whose daughter, Annette Yeong, 10, is a student at the centre, is taking a broader view on having the younger of her two daughters take the preparatory course.
Having witnessed many potential undergraduates fumble at interviews, the admissions director at Singapore Management University feels that the programme helps in ""personal branding"" by training Annette to become more articulate.
While acting is Annette's main interest, she also does visual arts and musical theatre, as well as ballet and jazz dance, and she plans to attend an acting masterclass in New York at the end of the year.
""I like acting the most because I don't only have to be Annette, I can be someone else,"" says the Primary 5 pupil at Methodist Girls' School.
Sota principal Lim Geok Cheng says: ""We do know that some of our students attend preparatory lessons. Sota is trying to level the playing field by conducting workshops in portfolio compilation and submission through the primary schools.""
Moreover, the school has a range of exercises to identify talent and taking preparatory classes can be counter-productive, she says.
""Students have been admitted based on their exposure to the arts through aesthetics lessons or CCAs in their primary schools. We have even seen some talented students who made it through the auditions based on their personal learning from watching YouTube videos.""
Ian Ong, 17, a Year 5 student at Sota, is among those who did not attend prep classes for admission. He had heard about Sota from one of his teachers at Edgefield Primary School and put together a portfolio a month before the application date, unlike others who may have spent two years preparing one.
He says: ""It's possible to get in on your own merit and with your own passion and skill if you show that you're interested and have the potential to grow.""

"," When Japanese troops invaded Penang in 1941, Puan Noor Aishah left primary school and learnt instead to cook and sew to supplement her family's income.
She peddled nasi lemak with her mother, took orders for embroidery and tried to pick up new skills, hungry to make up for the abrupt end to her formal education. This eagerness to learn put her in good stead when her husband Yusof Ishak was made Yang di-Pertuan Negara in 1959. Puan Noor Aishah was just 26.
Her role as spouse of Singapore's head of state put her in completely uncharted waters, she recalls in a new 200-page biography published by Straits Times Press and launched at The Arts House by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday.
Written by legal scholar and historian Kevin Y.L. Tan, the book also contains photos of Puan Noor Aishah and her family, including those from her private albums.
She said of her rapid adjustment: ""I was not given any instructions or briefing at all; no guidelines. I had no task lists and no one briefed me on things like etiquette, dress codes and protocol. We had to learn and manage on our own.""
She made her mark. She figured out the Istana's workings, and soon breathed new life into it by teaching its cooks - who were still preparing English classics like roast beef and Yorkshire pudding - her own recipes for local favourites like beef rendang.
She went for English lessons, organised events for dignitaries and became involved with voluntary organisations. And when her husband's health began to decline after a heart attack in 1968, she shouldered some of his social responsibilities.
SHE WITNESSED SINGAPORE'S GROWTH
He did not live to see the development and transformation of the Singapore which he had played such an important part in creating. But Puan Noor Aishah has witnessed how Singapore, after its tentative beginnings as a nation, has prospered over the last 50 years.
She celebrated SG50 with us, and she should soon see Singapore have another Malay president, if all goes well. I hope it will be a president who will bring as much distinction and honour to the office, and will be as well loved and remembered by Singaporeans as Encik Yusof Ishak.
PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG, on Mr Yusof Ishak and Puan Noor Aishah.
PM Lee, who grew up playing with her three children, said of the book: ""It will record for generations of Singaporeans her life story, the role she played and her contributions to our early nation-building days.""
Since her husband died in 1970 of heart failure, Puan Noor Aishah, now 84, has largely kept out of the limelight, and the book offers a precious glimpse into her eventful life.
Born in 1933, she was adopted by Fatimah Ali and Mohammad Salim Jusoh, who was formerly known as Barney Perkins and had converted to Islam. They lived an unassuming life in Penang - until Puan Noor Aishah caught the eye of Mr Yusof. At 39, he was ready to settle down after years of rebuffing matchmaking attempts to focus on Utusan Melayu, the Malay daily he co-founded.
A close friend coaxed him into looking through photos of potential brides, and the last was of Puan Noor Aishah. Something about her face intrigued Mr Yusof, who told his friend: ""This one, I agree.""
He was whisked away to Penang for a first meeting. But, recalls Puan Noor Aishah, although her older sister took her to a garden one day to meet ""a good man"", all she did was sit at a table sipping tea. She never saw Mr Yusof, who was seated nearby so he could steal glances at her and was too shy to take a good look. Still, he wanted to marry her. They had their first proper meeting two days later, on their wedding day.
Puan Noor Aishah also shares details about her life with Mr Yusof: His favourite dish was rendang kerang (cockles rendang), and his pet name for her was ""Teh"", short for ""Cik Puteh"" (fair-skinned lady).
Their first home was in a small kampung with no running water or electricity. But these were tumultuous times for Singapore, and Puan Noor Aishah and Mr Yusof would soon find their lives upended.
When the People's Action Party won the 1959 General Election, Mr Yusof was first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew's pick for Yang di-Pertuan Negara. PM Lee noted Mr Lee wanted a distinguished Malay as the first head of state, to show the federation that Singaporeans accepted Malays as their leaders, and to forge good relations with Tunku Abdul Rahman and other Malay leaders.
PM Lee said Mr Yusof answered the call of duty, continuing as first president on independence, and discharged his duties with dedication and dignity while standing for the enduring values that underpin Singapore's success - meritocracy, multiracialism and modernisation - with Puan Noor Aishah by his side.
She insisted on living simply so their children's lives were as ""normal"" as possible. They lived in a small bungalow on the Istana grounds, and Mr Yusof paid the rent out of his salary. And while the family would lunch at the dining table using porcelain crockery and cutlery, they would roll out a carpet for dinner, and sit on the floor eating with their fingers, in the traditional way.
As the president's wife, Puan Noor Aishah kept traditions alive, from putting Malay dishes and kuih on the Istana menu to wearing kebaya - which she sewed herself - at state events. She transformed the tenor and feel of the Istana. In the colonial era, it was a ""staid, stuffy, officious and distant place"", the book notes, but by the end of 1960, it was ""elegant, traditional, Asian, full of charm, warm and welcoming"".
Puan Noor Aishah, who was at the launch with family members, including daughter Zuriana and granddaughter Fatimah Imran, said she was grateful for the effort behind the book. She was initially reluctant to have it, but friend and long-time neighbour T.P.B. Menon persuaded her to share her ""unique and extraordinary"" life story.

"," Presidential elections; Candidates; Muslims
"," On social media, debates on what constitutes ""Malayness"" are rife, especially with the presidential election, which has been reserved for Malay candidates only, looming.
So far, two individuals from the corporate sector have indicated their intention to contest.
Over the weekend, Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob said she is considering contesting. If she decides to run, she must resign as Speaker and also step down as MP for Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC.
Singaporeans will see the first Malay president since Mr Yusof Ishak, who died in 1970. However, not many Malays are eligible to contest this election because of the strict criteria for candidates. For example, the person must either be a former minister, Speaker of Parliament, top civil servant (such as permanent secretary, auditor-general or chairman of key statutory boards) or the most senior executive of a company with $500 million shareholders' equity.
Netizens have suggested that to increase the pool of potential candidates, the definition of a ""Malay"" be expanded.DEBATES ON MALAYNESS
Just who should be considered a ""Malay""? Article 19B of the Singapore Constitution defines a Malay as ""any person, whether of the Malay race or otherwise, who considers himself to be a member of the Malay community and who is generally accepted as a member of the Malay community by that community"".
This definition also applies to Malay candidates intending to stand in a Group Representation Constituency (GRC) in a general election. The law requires that in a GRC, at least one member of the team is a Malay, an Indian or from other minority communities.
The definition of Malay here is quite an open, all-inclusive one.
In Malaysia, the issue of Malay identity has been widely discussed by sociologists. Debates over who qualifies as Malay took place against the backdrop of the New Economic Policy, which grants Malays certain economic and other benefits.
Sociologists underline three schools of thought on Malay identity. The first is primordialism, which underscores the role of ancestry. Thus, a person's ethnic identity is determined by birth. But inter-ethnic marriages have made this perspective irrelevant.
The second is constructivism, which highlights the heterogeneity of the social group called ""Malays"". Essentially, this argues that identity is constructed socially and that, over time and across communities, the definition of what a Malay person is can become porous.
Scholars upholding more extreme interpretations of this perspective grapple with the role of Islam: how important a marker of Malay identity is it? Can someone living in Malaysia (or Singapore), become Malay (masuk Melayu) if he or she embraces Islam?
The third perspective is situationalism, which implies that some people identify with Malayness when it is advantageous to be part of the community.
Ultimately, there is generally a stable core which the majority of Malays identify with. In Malaysia, this is recognised in the Malaysian Constitution: Malays are Muslims, speak the Malay language and follow Malay custom.VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY
How is acceptance into the Malay community measured, as worded in the Singapore Constitution?
So far, online discussions have emphasised the presidential aspirants' race, their ability to converse in the Malay language and religion. The extent to which these aspirants have spoken for their community is somehow neglected.
Here, Singaporeans should draw inspiration from the history of the Malays. Singapore Malays have identified some prominent names as part of their community, though they may not strictly come from the Malay race. These individuals have defended the Malays and struggled for their plight.
One such individual was Abdullah Abdul Kadir Munshi (1796-1854), a famous chronicler, Malay language teacher and interpreter who worked for Sir Stamford Raffles. His grandfather was of Yemeni Arab descent and his grandmother a Tamil. Malays accept Munshi Abdullah as an intellectual. He wrote on the plight of the Malays during the feudal era and colonial period, and was critical of the Malay ruling class for not investing enough in educating their people.
The other personality was Professor Syed Hussein Alatas (1928-2007), a former head of Malay Studies at the National University of Singapore. Of hadrami (Yemeni) descent, the sociologist spent most of his life in Malaysia and Singapore. His writings focused on the modernisation of the Malays and the community's development lag. He also wrote a pioneering book, The Myth Of The Lazy Native, debunking negative stereotypes about the Malays imposed by colonial scholars.
A name more familiar to Singaporeans is that of Mr Yusof Ishak, whose ancestors originated from Sumatra in Indonesia.
Throughout his life, Mr Yusof struggled for the Malays. In 1939, he founded the newspaper Utusan Melayu because he wanted the Malays to have an equal voice in the public sphere which, he claimed, was dominated by Indian Muslims and Arabs. Having shown this empathy for his community, Mr Yusof fit smoothly into the role as Singapore's first head of state.
Today, Mr Yusof is remembered as an outstanding member of the pioneer generation, as someone who defended multiculturalism and meritocracy, the building blocks of Singapore society.
In today's context, there is a convergence of interests among all ethnic communities. It is difficult to distinguish Malay issues from Chinese or Indian ones, and problems facing Singaporeans are not unique to any community.
Thus, Malay presidential candidates should be judged by their ability to articulate the interests of Singaporeans.
Granted, the role of the presidency is not a political but symbolic one. The president is not required to act as a check and balance on the Government, apart from being a gatekeeper of the country's reserves and key public appointments.
Still, Singaporeans expect their president to rise to the occasion and unite all citizens in times of crisis. So, a candidate's track record of speaking up for their people is key.

"," July 21 is Racial Harmony Day, which schools started observing in 1997. On the 20th anniversary of Racial Harmony Day, Senior Correspondent Toh Yong Chuan reports on efforts to build and boost trust among people of different races and religions in Singapore. Here are 20 items on issues and policies to do with racial and religious harmony.
Two racial riots
A couple of riots broke out in Singapore in 1964 - the first of which took place on July 21, which is today marked as Racial Harmony Day.
Amid rising communal tensions following the Malaysian general election in May that year, a procession celebrating Prophet Muhammad's birthday was disrupted by clashes between Chinese and Malays.
The first day of rioting saw four killed and 178 injured.
The authorities imposed night curfews island-wide and set up goodwill committees of community leaders to calm the situation.
But clashes continued through July, and by the time the situation calmed down in early August, 23 had died and 454 were injured.
The calm did not last long.
On Sept 2, 1964, fighting broke out after a Malay trishaw rider was found dead in Geylang Serai.
The fighting that lasted over a week left 13 dead and 106 injured.
In 1997, the Ministry of Education began marking July 21 as Racial Harmony Day. On this day, schools hold activities to teach students the importance of maintaining racial and religious harmony.Zero tolerance for racism
There is zero tolerance for racial incidents here, but once in a while, they happen and go viral.
In a Facebook post in May this year, Singaporean actor Shrey Bhargava alleged he was a target of racism during an audition for a Jack Neo movie.
In April last year, local bakery chain PrimaDeli apologised and sacked a staff member who allegedly made racist remarks to a candidate during a job interview.
In October 2012, the National Trades Union Congress fired assistant director of membership Amy Cheong, a 38-year-old Australian and Singapore permanent resident, over her expletive-filled racist rant on Facebook. Police also issued a stern warning to her in March 2013, after an investigation.
However, not all racial incidents that went viral have been negative.
In January this year, former senior parliamentary secretary Maidin Packer shared how Malay wedding guests at an HDB void deck in Pasir Ris stood to pay their respects to a passing Chinese funeral procession.
""This is so Singapore,"" he wrote on Facebook.Terrorism
Terrorism has changed the face of racial harmony in Singapore.
The Sept 11, 2001 attacks on the United States killed nearly 3,000 people and injured more than 6,000.
In Singapore, the Internal Security Department (ISD) crippled a local cell of regional terror network Jemaah Islamiah (JI), arresting 13 members in December 2001 and 19 in August 2002.
The group wanted to create an Islamic State in the region, and was plotting to bomb foreign embassies and government buildings here.
After its plans here were foiled, the group staged the Bali bombings in October 2012 that killed more 200 people.
Although JI has been weakened, its ideology remains and radicals have pledged allegiance to terror group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
In the past three years, the ISD has detected and detained 15 self-radicalised Singaporeans who were seduced by ISIS' propaganda, including some who were planning to travel overseas to fight.
The latest cases involved an infant care assistant, the first woman to be detained for radicalisation, and two auxiliary police officers.Harmony Centre
The Harmony Centre is tucked within the premises of the modern-looking An-Nahdhah Mosque in heartland Bishan.
The centre houses artefacts and information about Islam, as well as other major religions in Singapore.
It also organises inter-faith programmes, such as dialogues with leaders from other religious groups.
Run by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis), the centre was set up to promote a greater understanding of Islam and Muslims among Singapore's multiracial and multi-religious society.
Its programmes include talks and open houses, and it regularly hosts visitors from local groups and abroad.
When Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong opened the centre on Oct 7, 2006, he said: ""It aims to be a one-stop centre to promote inter-religious dialogue, and to explain the true teachings of Islam.""
He added that its opening was ""a significant step forward in continuing efforts to bring Singaporeans of different faiths closer together"".Race
Race is one of the three key potential fault lines in Singapore.
The National Pledge starts with this sentence: ""We, the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves as one united people, regardless of race, language or religion...""
It is a recognition that race, language and religion are forces that can divide Singaporeans.
Of the 3,408,900 Singapore citizens, 2,595,800 (76.1 per cent) are Chinese; 510,200 (15 per cent) are Malays; 253,300 (7.4 per cent) are Indians; and 49,700 (1.5 per cent), including Eurasians, are classified as ""Others"".
Although the Chinese are the overwhelming majority, the Singapore Constitution guarantees that all persons are equal before the law and that there shall be no discrimination on the basis of, among other things, race.
It also states that the Government has the responsibility to constantly care for the interests of racial and religious minorities.
The Constitution also recognises that the Malays have a ""special position"", because they are ""the indigenous people of Singapore"", and that the Government has a responsibility to safeguard their interests and language.Attitudes
Several surveys in the past few years have shed light on Singaporeans' attitudes towards racial harmony.
In August last year, broadcaster Channel NewsAsia and the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) - a think-tank - published a survey which found Singaporeans strongly support multiracialism and meritocracy.
But while nearly all of the 2,000 citizens polled said they respected people from all races and that all races should be treated equally, almost half recognised that racism could be a problem and were aware that a significant number are at least mildly racist.
The IPS also published a survey in 2014 which found that 16 per cent of 4,000 Singapore residents polled felt that racial prejudice had grown over the preceding five years, while 46.8 per cent said it had not changed.
These findings share a common thread: Singaporeans recognise that racism, in some form, still exists here, and should be countered.Confidence-building
Community confidence-building is a tool Singapore has consistently used to promote racial harmony.
An army of more than 38,000 volunteers recruited by the People's Association (PA) run activities that promote social cohesion and bonding in all the constituencies.
One such grassroots leader is Mr K. Gopal. The 66-year-old has experienced racial riots first-hand - the 1964 riots took place when he was 13 and living in the quarters of the Royal Air Force base in Changi. His father worked there as a technical officer.
NEUTRAL POSITION
As Indians, we did not side with anyone during the racial riots. But there was the perception that we may be siding with either of the races. For example, some Indians could speak dialects like Hokkien and could be seen as siding with the Chinese. We remained neutral in the riots.''
MR K. GOPAL, on how Indians felt when Chinese and Malays clashed.
""We were frightened,"" he said. ""My parents did not allow me to go to school for several days.""
He started volunteering with the PA in the late 1980s and has served on committees such as the residents' committee and citizens' consultative committee.
He is now the honorary chairman of the Nee Soon East Community Club Management Committee.
A grassroots leader helps promote bonding and builds trust among people living in the community, he said.
""The riots were violent and there was bloodshed. We cannot let it happen again.""Islamophobia
Islamophobia is the dislike or fear of Islam, arising from prejudiced views against the religion.
Muslims here and abroad have been put under the spotlight each time terrorists abuse the faith and invoke its teachings to commit terror acts. And Islamic scholars and community leaders have consistently condemned terrorists who use Islam to justify their violent acts.
Singapore's top Islamic scholar, Mufti Fatris Bakaram, said in his Hari Raya Aidilfitri sermon last month that the faith respects local cultures, and the traditions and cultures in Singapore do not conflict with the Prophet's teachings.
Playing a key role in preventing Islamophobia from sinking its roots here are the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCC) in all constituencies here. These local-level, inter-faith groupings were set up to promote racial and religious harmony, including by getting people to better understand various faiths and their teachings.
Several government leaders have spoken up against Islamophobia recently. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last month that Islamophobia is as bad and unacceptable as radical terrorism, adding: ""We have to make sure that none of that happens.""Affirmative action
Affirmative action is a broad term to describe positive discrimination, or efforts to assist a group that has been under-represented in a particular role. The term has been used to describe changes to the Constitution to guarantee minority representation in the presidency. These will see this year's presidential election reserved for Malay candidates.
""There is an element of affirmative action in the approach,"" former Cabinet minister S. Dhanabalan said at a public hearing when the changes were being considered by a commission set up to review the elected presidency.
Some analysts have pointed out the pitfalls of such action. Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) deputy director Gillian Koh noted: ""The moment you institute this, you are saying certain communities cannot make it and they require certain help.""
Such affirmative action is uncommon in Singapore, and some see it as going against the principle of meritocracy. But others have said the move upholds the equally important principle of multiracialism.
IPS' Mathew Mathews says the same eligibility criteria apply to all candidates regardless of race, adding: ""The reserved election serves to eliminate the possibility that racial biases may disadvantage minorities who are exceptionally qualified for the presidency.""Language
Like race and religion, language can divide Singaporeans.
There are four official languages in Singapore - English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil.
English is the language of government administration. The laws are written in English. The primary language of instruction in schools is also English.
While there are four official languages, there is only one national language, which is Malay. The words of the National Anthem, Majulah Singapura, are in Malay.
The language issue crops up from time to time on the jobs front. While few employers now advertise that they want ""Chinese employees"", some jobseekers feel they use ""Chinese-speaking employees"" as a proxy.
The Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices, the national anti-workplace discrimination watchdog, says employers should look at jobseekers' skills and state the reason why proficiency in a particular language is needed. For example, a Chinese, Malay or Tamil language teacher is needed to teach the subject in a pre-school centre.Housing Board quotas
More than 80 per cent of Singaporeans live in Housing Board flats. In 1989, the Government introduced an Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) to prevent racial enclaves from emerging, by setting limits according to race on the proportion of flats in a block and a neighbourhood.
In 1989, the caps were set at:
- 22 per cent of flats in a neighbourhood for Malays, and 25 per cent in each block;
- 84 per cent of flats in a neighbourhood and 87 per cent in each block for Chinese;
- 10 per cent in a neighbourhood and 13 per cent in each block for Indians and other minority groups.
In 2010, the caps for Indians and other minorities were raised to 12 per cent of flats in a neighbourhood and 15 per cent in each block.
Under the policy, owners are free to sell their flat to a buyer of any race, as long as the racial limits are kept.
The Government also introduced caps in 2010 on non-Malaysian permanent residents. They cannot occupy more than 5 per cent of flats in a neighbourhood and 8 per cent in a block.
The EIP is the Government's way of maintaining a balanced, multiracial mix in the community.A spirit of give-and-take
Observers and politicians have noted that Singapore is a small country and Singaporeans live in close proximity to one another. Friction, including between people of different races, cannot be avoided.
Institute of Policy Studies deputy director Gillian Koh wrote in The Straits Times last month: ""Different groups and their practices bump into each other in the heartland, at work... When conflict arises, we can resort to taking or giving offence, or turn these incidents into opportunities to deepen understanding and strengthen cohesion.""
The spirit of give-and-take also requires responsible religious leaders who are able to handle sensitive issues, noted Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in 2015. ""From time to time, we will have prickly issues, we have incidents with a racial tinge.
""For example, when you are dealing with families where there have been conversions, where there have been inter-religious marriages, where there are children involved... It is very sensitive, emotions are up, everybody is already upset, and something like this comes along, it can easily become a problem.
""And so we have responsible religious leaders... they set the example, and so we have been able to have amicable, compromise solutions with a spirit of give-and-take.""Religion
Religion is a major potential fault line in Singapore.
Recognising that religion can divide Singaporeans, Parliament passed the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill in 1990.
When the proposed law was debated, then Home Affairs Minister S. Jayakumar said that it was ""preventive"" in nature. It was meant ""to nip problems in the bud... to prevent matters from escalating and creating tensions, frictions and conflicts between different religious groups"", he added.
The Act gives powers to the Government to issue restraining orders against any person who causes ill feelings between different religious groups. Those who violate the restraining orders may be fined or jailed, or both.
A Presidential Council for Religious Harmony was also set up to advise the Minister for Home Affairs on matters that affect religious harmony in Singapore.
The current 10-member council is chaired by former Supreme Court judge Goh Joon Seng.Meritocracy
Meritocracy has always been a key pillar of Singapore's policies.
The idea is that success is not tied to one's background, such as race, and opportunities are given to everyone to succeed on his own merits.
This idea is important for preserving racial harmony because it means that no racial group will be given special treatment and neither will any be put at a disadvantage.
But Dr Norshahril Saat, a fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said in a commentary in The Straits Times last year that meritocracy in Singapore was not perfect.
The ""abridged"" version has ensured minority representation in Parliament and stabilised race relations.
Reserving the next presidential election for Malays was necessary to develop trust among the races, he added.OnePeople.sg
OnePeople.sg is the national body that promotes racial and religious harmony. It says on its website that it ""champions racial harmony initiatives in Singapore"".
Its current chairman is Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Education, and Communications and Information.
Its founding members are the People's Association, all five Community Development Councils and five ethnic-based self-help groups.
OnePeople.sg's predecessor was the Central Singapore Joint Social Service Centre set up in 1997 to coordinate the resources of the CDCs and self-help groups in reaching out to Singaporeans. The centre took on the role of promoting racial harmony in 2001, coordinating such activities with PA. It was renamed OnePeople.sg in 2007.
The organisation is particularly known for the month-long Orange Ribbon activities that it has organised every July since 2008 to promote racial harmony.New fault lines
On Racial Harmony Day in July 2012, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned of new fault lines emerging in Singapore.
On top of race and religion, he highlighted rising tensions between citizens and new immigrants as a cause of worry.
His warning came at a time when anti-foreigner sentiments were rising and locals perceived new immigrants and foreigners as causing social problems and snatching jobs.
It was not just a one-way street. In September 2015, a 28-year-old Filipino nurse was sentenced to four months' jail for making xenophobic and inflammatory remarks about Singaporeans and lying to the police.
The most high-profile anti-foreigner case was arguably that of Singaporean Yang Kaiheng, 28, and his wife Ai Takagi, 24, an Australian of Japanese descent.
The couple, who were behind socio-political website The Real Singapore, were convicted under the Sedition Act last year for deliberately sowing discord between Singaporeans and foreigners through a series of articles on their website. Yang was sentenced to eight months' jail and Ai, 10 months.Youth and racial harmony
Two weeks ago , the National Youth Council released the findings of a survey that the attitudes of young people towards other races and nationalities have improved.
Of the 3,531 young people aged between 15 and 34 polled, the percentage of those who have a close friend of a different race increased from 53 per cent in 2013, when the last survey was conducted, to 60 per cent last year, while those with a close friend of a different nationality also grew from 42 per cent to 45 per cent.
Dr Janil Puthucheary, chairman of OnePeople.sg, said the nature of what young people see as racial issues has also changed.
""No longer are we worried about race and race bias in terms of access to public services such as education, health and housing,"" said the Senior Minister of State for Education, and Communications and Information.
Their concerns have taken on an ""aspirational tone"", such as worrying whether they have friends of other races, he said.
""What they are worried about are issues like: 'Are they friendly to me? Do they make racist jokes? Do they have a stereotype? Do they see me for who I am?',"" he added.Declaration of religious harmony
The idea of a code on religious harmony was first suggested by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in October 2002, after the two waves of Jemaah Islamiah (JI) arrests in Singapore.
A team headed by then Minister of State Chan Soo Sen worked on the code. Leaders from various faiths were asked to take part.
The code was unveiled in June 2003 and read for the first time at the Racial Harmony Day celebrations a month later. It is now read in schools every year, on July 21.
The declaration says:
""We, the people in Singapore, declare that religious harmony is vital for peace, progress and prosperity in our multiracial and multi-religious Nation.
We resolve to strengthen religious harmony through mutual tolerance, confidence, respect, and understanding.
We shall always:
Recognise the secular nature of our State,
Promote cohesion within our society,
Respect each other's freedom of religion,
Grow our common space while respecting our diversity,
Foster inter-religious communications, and thereby ensure that religion will not be abused to create conflict and disharmony in Singapore.""Activities to mark racial harmony
For Racial Harmony Day, which started in schools 20 years ago, activities were held last Friday to mark the occasion.
At most schools, students donned ethnic clothes to represent diversity. Methodist Girls' School went a step further, however.
It tied up with the People's Association to conduct an art project for which students painted images of samsui women - migrant construction workers in the 1920s to 1940s - on wooden planks that were displayed at the school.
""Samsui women are among the pioneers who built Singapore,"" said art teacher Natasha Tay. ""Pioneers like them also contributed to building racial harmony in Singapore.""
Alison Lim, nine, who took part in the project, said: ""I learnt the samsui women were resilient."" She also learnt to include other races in her circle of friends.
The Primary 4 pupil said she had watched videos in class that showed racial riots of the past. ""We were surprised that people were fighting then. It is so peaceful now.""Why the need for Racial Harmony Day?
When Racial Harmony Day was first observed at the Methodist Girls' School on July 21, 1997, Christina Loong was a 13-year-old Secondary 1 student there.
Fast forward 20 years. She is still in the same school, but she has since shed her school uniform. Instead of sitting at the back of the class facing the blackboard, she now stands in front of the class teaching history and social studies to Secondary 1 and 4 students.
Now 33, Ms Loong has a fuzzy memory of exactly what happened 20 years ago.
But she recalled watching a video of the racial riots in school. ""We were horrified by what we saw,"" she said. ""Most of us did not know about the riots until we learnt about them in class and watched the video.""
The annual Racial Harmony Day remains relevant, she added.
""The students now are more aware of racial harmony - they have more sources of information and are better informed,"" said Ms Loong. ""But it is still important to have a constant reminder of the importance of racial harmony.""

"," Children whose parents struggle to give them a good start should not have to suffer the consequences of being set back in school and further on in life. A recent decision by the Government to meet this challenge head-on, through a permanent scheme to help low-income kids with their learning and development, is thus to be welcomed. This is necessary as Singapore's high income inequality has persisted despite various forms of financial aid for those on low wages.
It is also timely, given the way well-heeled, well-educated parents are increasingly hot-housing their offspring from a very young age, to ensure success in school and at work. Of course, one would expect all parents to do their utmost to help their children get ahead. However, patterns of privilege might lead to a higher proportion of children from well-resourced families going to branded schools, gaining scholarships and securing good jobs. The trend is so pronounced it has led to concerns in developed societies of meritocracy becoming ""inherited"".
KidStart helps disadvantaged children, aged up to six, through support that includes pre-natal screening, home visits for babies' nutrition and care, playgroups for those aged one to three, and dedicated staff at pre-schools who focus on keeping these children in school. Its initial goal is to reach 1,000 children and prevent them from falling behind.
Inter-generational poverty is a troubling sign that social mobility has slowed at the bottom rungs of society. If left unchecked, it will drain a country's collective confidence in the future. Thus, the Government is right to invest resources to break the poverty cycle via upstream measures, though this is admittedly a labour-intensive exercise. One-on-one interventions will be needed to track overall development. There are also plans to shape early intervention schemes for at-risk youth and adults. Proactive aid is key to rescuing individuals and families from a downward spiral from which they may struggle to recover. However, such aid has to be carefully calibrated so as not to encourage over-reliance on state help by adult recipients.
The goal of preventing inequality and family dysfunction from becoming entrenched is a laudable one. While the Ministry of Social and Family Development has the option to be more reactive in its policy design, Minister Tan Chuan-Jin has expressed his own belief that ""we need to be a lot more aggressive and identify the precursors"". Such social policy will call for commitment in the face of slower economic growth which might affect social spending. The benefits, however, will outweigh the costs by helping children, whose start line is far behind that of their peers, to stay in the race. Given the nation's low birth rates, every child must have opportunities to make good.

"," That Singapore will soon have a Malay president after 47 years is, for presidential candidate Halimah Yacob, an affirmation of two core values Singaporeans hold dear: multiracialism and meritocracy.
""It shows we don't only talk about multiracialism, but we talk about it in the context of meritocracy or opportunities for everyone, and we actually practise it,"" she told The Straits Times in an interview yesterday.
Elaborating, she said it demonstrates Singaporeans can ""accept anyone of any colour, any creed, any religion, at any position in our society, so long as they feel that the person can contribute"".
Her resignation from her posts as Speaker of Parliament, MP and member of the People's Action Party on Monday to contest the upcoming election has seen views opposed to changes to the presidency resurface, with some questioning the commitment to meritocracy.
Madam Halimah firmly refutes the view that the election, which will be reserved for Malay candidates, entails a trade-off between multiracialism and meritocracy.
It, in fact, ensures both founding ideals are preserved - giving fair access for all races to be represented at one time or other, in the highest office of the land, while requiring that each and every candidate meets the same stipulated criteria.
""All candidates have to qualify,"" she said, noting the Constitutional Commission reviewing the elected presidency last year had made clear its stand on this issue.
""If we weaken eligibility criteria for those taking part in a reserved election, yes, then we are compromising meritocracy for representation. We are not - the same criteria apply to everybody,"" she stressed.
The commission had proposed reserving an election for candidates from a race if it had not been represented in the presidency for five terms. It also updated eligibility criteria for private sector candidates, who must have led a company with at least $500 million in shareholder equity. The changes were passed by Parliament last November.
Madam Halimah, 62, has been described by observers as the front runner. They note she is the only aspirant who automatically qualifies to stand, having held the post of Parliament Speaker since 2013.
Two other candidates who have indicated their interest to run, Bourbon Offshore Asia Pacific chairman Farid Khan, 62, and Second Chance Properties chief executive Salleh Marican, 67, do not automatically meet the financial threshold.
They have to convince the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC) they have the experience and ability to effectively carry out the functions of the office if elected.
Asked about the prospect of a contested election in the interview at NTUC Centre, Madam Halimah said she will leave it to the PEC to decide, adding: ""We always go into a contest preparing for a contest.""
As for talk of a reserved election being akin to affirmative action, she said the comparison is wrong because affirmative action means ""you don't qualify, but you go in"".
While some have questioned the seemingly higher bar for private sector candidates, she said the approach that automatically qualifies public sector candidates ""has been in place since 1991"".
""It is an open, transparent system,"" she added.
Asked if her track record of 40 years in public service - 33 of them in the labour movement - would be a key plank of her campaign, Madam Halimah laughed and said more details will be revealed soon.
""Yes, having been in public service for a significant period, that has exposed me to the policymaking process, that has stood me in good stead, to understand how the Government functions.
""So that has been extremely useful, relevant, to what I am seeking to do,"" she added.

"," Presidents
"," Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia has issued a rebuttal to Utusan Malaysia newspaper over false allegations on Singapore's upcoming presidential election which is reserved for Malay candidates, and on its Malay community.
Mr Vanu Gopala Menon wrote to the Malay-language newspaper yesterday in reply to its Aug 14 article ""Berubahkah nasib kaum Melayu di Singapura? Presiden sekadar simbolik"" (Will the fortunes of Malays change in Singapore? President is only symbolic).
""Contrary to the false assertions in the commentary, the Singapore President, who is elected with a popular mandate, plays key roles in nation-building and in ensuring good governance,"" he wrote.
Mr Menon said these roles include being the symbol and unifier of a multiracial Singapore, the custodian of the country's reserves, and the protector of the integrity of its public service.
""Surely, Utusan Malaysia would agree that these are important tenets which every country should safeguard.""
The Aug 14 Utusan article by Ms Marzita Abdullah said: ""The post of President of Singapore sounds great but it is only symbolic without any political power.""
She wrote: ""Maybe because non-Malays in Singapore are given priority and advantages in all aspects, (previous) presidents did not have to struggle to consider the fate of their own race. Therefore, when a Malay holds the post of president, the direction that Malays are headed will surely be given attention as that race constantly feels sidelined in its own country.""
In his letter, Mr Menon stressed that ""Singapore's Malay community has achieved significant social and economic progress within Singapore's rules-based and meritocratic society"".
He said: ""We are, as a nation, proud of these accomplishments, and we will achieve further progress together. It is incorrect to say that non-Malays in Singapore have been given 'priority and advantages'. We certainly do not have a race-based system of benefits and patronage.""
He added: ""Singapore will not tolerate the use of race or religion to promote ill will between different segments of Singapore society, or to undermine our institutions.""
He had earlier replied to Utusan's May 28 editorial on the election to counter inaccuracies that meritocracy was used as an excuse to discriminate against the community.
""The Editor did not publish my letter for reasons I could not understand other than not providing a true picture to the readers. Instead, the Editor published a second commentary, with similar inaccuracies and misrepresentations,"" he said.
Utusan's largest shareholder is Umno, which dominates Malaysia's ruling coalition and owns 49.77 per cent of the 78-year-old newspaper.

"," The change to the Constitution to set aside reserved presidential elections for minorities will help ensure that Singapore's multiracial society stays afloat, and is one of the unique stabilisers in the country's political system, said Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.
Speaking at a National Day dinner in his Marine Parade ward yesterday, he said the Government has introduced ""Singapore-style innovations"" to the Westminster parliamentary system over the years to stabilise ""a free-wheeling democratic process"".
Citing other such stabilisers, he said the elected presidency itself serves as a check against a populist and profligate government; that the system of Non-Constituency MPs and Nominated MPs ensures there will always be opposition MPs; and that the Group Representation Constituency system guarantees a fair number of minority MPs in Parliament.
""If these stabilisers are not introduced to our political system, our democratic state risks being capsized when buffeted by internal differences and divisions, let alone external storms,"" he said.
The presidential election next month is reserved for Malay candidates, after changes to the Constitution to ensure multiracial representation in the highest office in the land.
Mr Goh said being able to keep politics resilient, bold, forward-looking and inclusive of all races and different political opinions is one key factor which will determine how Singapore fares as it deals with the challenges thrown up by a more turbulent world. Also important is having a robust leadership pipeline, and a cohesive and fair multiracial society, he added.
With Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is 65 this year, saying he will step down by age 70, the fourth-generation of political leaders will have to quickly establish themselves as a cohesive team and identify their team captain, Mr Goh said, adding that Singaporeans will want to know what they stand for.
He urged them to build a stronger and more inclusive team by bringing in potential office holders from outside the Singapore Armed Forces and the public sector to avoid group-think.
He also encouraged highly competent Singaporeans outside the Government to ""step up and serve"".
Finally, Mr Goh said, meritocracy must remain a key pillar of society to guard against social inequity - a deep fault line in many countries.
Still, he cautioned that while meritocracy may help the brightest and most hardworking rise to the top at first, it may end up entrenching the successful later, and the Government must intervene to ensure that meritocracy serves its purpose.
He added that the Government has expended immense resources on this, while guarding against the downsides of a generous welfare state, and people should not develop an entitlement mentality.
Singapore's success so far is not due to inherent talent or smarts, said Mr Goh, but the result of common values, political stability, national cohesion and good governance as well as each generation working and sacrificing for the next.
Describing this as the ""Singapore secret"", he said the fourth generation of leaders ""have their work cut out for them"".
""They will have to build their own social compact with the people... They will have to bequeath a fair and multiracial society to the generation after them.""

"," Education in Singapore is not just a national value but an obsession, so there is nothing surprising when it features prominently in the annual National Day Rally (NDR), the most important political speech of the year.
This year is no exception and the plans laid out by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong for early childhood education are both welcome news for the sector and a signal that the country intends to take a dramatic step forward in terms of access to pre-school education.
One thing is very clear: State involvement in the sector is expanding. This can be seen from the doubling of the state budget for early education by 2022, the addition of tens of thousands of places for children zero to four years of age in new centres, and the creation of centralised and standardised teacher training at a new national institute.
Greater state involvement in this fragmented sector is welcome. Unlike in secondary and tertiary education where Singapore is a global leader, it has ranked low internationally on early childhood education, as the 2012 Lien Foundation report, Starting Well, noted.
The recently announced changes have the potential to move the country closer to the top. Excellence there is characterised by, among other factors, near universal coverage for three- to five- year-olds, affordability and/or subsidies for low- and middle-income families, specific teacher qualification standards, and good teacher wages.
The stakes for Singapore are high and getting pre-school right will help with some of the country's longer-term challenges.
First, as the Prime Minister signalled in his speech, ensuring access to quality early education is a strategic move aimed at ensuring social mobility.

"," The Govt's announcement on Sunday that it would expand its provision of pre-school education will hearten both those on the political right and left, as it advances both equality of outcomes and opportunity.
At Sunday's National Day Rally, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong unveiled a concerted push to improve the quality of and access to pre-schools - increasing places, expanding the share of state pre-schools and giving teachers better training and prospects. He said about the move: ""If we get this right, we will foster social mobility and sustain a fair and just society.""
The phrase ""fair and just society"" is not new. But it is noteworthy for the comeback it has made in Singapore's political vocabulary of late.
If you look just at the National Day Rally - the biggest political speech of the year - and its shorter cousin, the National Day Message, the expression has been uttered six times by PM Lee since 2011 - once each in 2011 and 2012, twice in 2013, then once each again in 2015 and 2017. They were spoken in the context not just of education but housing, healthcare, social mobility and individuals giving back to society.
In contrast, from 2004 (when Mr Lee became Prime Minister) to 2010, this set of words did not appear in either annual speech - although, it must be said, some policy announcements were in a similar vein.
But there can be little doubt that the phrase is in vogue. And it is probably not an exaggeration to say that since 2011, PM Lee has made the ""fair and just society"" an integral part of his vision for Singapore.

"," The clock has started ticking.
In less than four weeks, Singapore will elect its eighth president. Nomination Day will fall on Sept 13. Polling Day will be Sept 23. The election will be reserved for Malay candidates, since five terms have passed without a Malay president.
Thus, by Sept 23, Singapore would have elected its first Malay president in more than 46 years. The previous onewas Mr Yusof Ishak, the Republic's inaugural head of state. He died in 1970 before the end of his third term.
Three uncertainties confront Singaporeans at this juncture.
First, will there be a contest?
Supporters of former Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob, 63, will probably sense the mantle of history moving towards their candidate. She is hitherto the only presidential hopeful who meets the criteria for automatic qualification.
She qualifies on her experience as Speaker, a post she held from 2013 to Aug 7 this year, when she stepped down to run for the presidency.
The others who have applied to run are Mr Farid Khan, 61, chairman of a marine services firm, and Mr Salleh Marican, 67, chief executive of a listed property company.
To qualify automatically, private sector candidates must have helmed a company with an average shareholder equity of $500 million in the three most recent years. Both Mr Farid and Mr Salleh fall short.
But it is too early for Madam Halimah's team to be measuring the drapes for the Istana office.
There may be others who qualify but have yet to declare their interest. All who want to run have to apply for certificates by next Monday.
Also, the Presidential Elections Committee has the discretion to qualify candidates via a deliberative track, if their experiences are comparable to the automatic criteria.
In 2011, the committee surprised many by clearing Mr Tan Jee Say. He too did not meet the explicit criteria, but it said his firm was ""an organisation of equivalent complexity"".
Still, Madam Halimah is undoubtedly the current front runner. She has served close to 40 years in public service and the labour movement. She was a union lawyer, an MP, deputy secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress, minister of state in two ministries, and the first woman to become Speaker of Parliament.
People also remember her fights on behalf of the underdog - whether vulnerable workers or pre-school children from low-income families.
She is the clear favourite to win at the moment, if there is a contest.
The second uncertainty: If there is a contest, will it be dignified?
Singapore has seen only two contested presidential elections: in 1993 and 2011.
The 1993 one, which elected President Ong Teng Cheong, is generally remembered as a tepid affair.
But 2011 saw four candidates surnamed Tan - dubbed the ""Tan Quartet"" - engaged in a vigorous jostle for the office. Observers said there was a politicisation of the presidency, with some candidates at times making promises on issues that clearly fell outside the constitutionally prescribed powers of the president.
To ensure this would not happen again, Parliament amended the laws to require that each candidate sign a statutory declaration that ""he understands the president's role under the Constitution"".
Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing, who introduced the Bill in Parliament, stressed that making a false declaration ""is an offence"".
A campaign this year is thus likely to be calmer and more correct. But if the race is close, candidates may yet be tempted to take chances.
The third and final uncertainty: Will Singaporeans take to the concept of a reserved election?
The issue has been discussed for nearly two years, since Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong asked a Constitutional Commission to look into the need for minorities to be elected to the highest office from time to time, to ensure it reflects Singapore's multiracial society.
This led to the ""five-term hiatus"" rule, paving the way for this election to be reserved for Malay candidates.
Some have expressed concern that the rule may erode meritocracy, since it seems to choose a president on factors other than merit.
The Government's response can be thus summarised: On principle, Singaporeans should decide on merit alone. But the evidence shows that many do consider race when voting. Meritorious minority candidates are hence less easily elected. To ignore this reality could cause more damage to the system, because Singapore would be forgoing multiracial representation, which is as important a value as meritocracy.
The ""five-term hiatus"" rule strikes a good balance, because it provides for a future where minority candidates might be elected in open elections. The rule would then fall out of use naturally, an outcome that all Singaporeans would hope for.
Dissenters may not come round to the Government's view via just theoretical argument. The issue might be settled only after Singaporeans live through a presidential term following a reserved election, and decide from the experience if the country is better off for it.
This would place a heavy burden on the next president.
The person has to show Singaporeans that he or she is every bit as capable of performing the roles and duties of president as one produced by an open election.

"," People have always come before party colours for presidential hopeful Halimah Yacob, who said at a press conference yesterday - to unveil her campaign slogan - that her close ties to the ruling party will not affect her ability to act independently as president.
The long-time People's Action Party MP, who left her political and party posts earlier this month to run in the presidential election, said: ""Whatever I do, it must always be the people first, and the people first, and the people first.""
""And if, as a candidate, at any time, I feel that I am not able to be independent, I would not offer myself,"" she added, a day after the Writ of Election was issued.
Madam Halimah was speaking at the NTUC Centre where she announced her slogan, ""Do Good Do Together"", and introduced some members of her campaign team.
She also fielded questions from reporters ranging from whether she could truly be independent, to whether a walkover may impact her legitimacy as president.
Since the former Speaker of Parliament announced her presidential bid, she has sought to convince Singaporeans that her past political affiliations will not compromise her independence.
Pointing to her long years in public service - she spent more than two decades in the labour movement before joining politics in 2001 - she said she has always placed the interests of the people first.
She added that it will be ""a gross disservice"" to do otherwise.
She cited former president Ong Teng Cheong as a PAP politician- turned-president who did not always agree with the Government and established for himself the reputation of ""the people's president"".
""Every day, we get up, we have to look at ourselves and ask ourselves, who are we serving? I have asked myself that question and I know where my loyalty lies. My loyalty lies with Singapore and Singaporeans, and nothing else,"" she said, adding that she has, during her time in the unions and in politics, disagreed with the Government.
Singaporeans will vote in the first presidential election reserved for Malay candidates on Sept 23, if more than one person qualifies to run for the position.
Madam Halimah is the only one among the three aspiring candidates who automatically qualifies, having served as Speaker of Parliament for more than three years.
Whether the other two candidates will qualify will depend on the discretion of the Presidential Elections Committee, which assesses candidates for eligibility.
Asked if she would worry about her legitimacy as president if she won in a walkover, she said: ""This is a democratic process... Eligibility criteria are transparent.""
Law don Simon Tay, who was at the press conference as one of Madam Halimah's nominators, pointed out that former president S R Nathan twice became president in a walkover, after other prospective candidates were found ineligible.
""At the end of his two terms, President Nathan had erased any question mark over his presidency,"" he said. ""I think history has borne out that Singaporeans recognise a good president when they have one.""
Madam Halimah, who has fought and won four general elections, added that she would be prepared whether the election turns out to be a two- or three-cornered fight.
She is expected to submit her application forms to run in the election today.
On whether she would prefer to contest in an election open to candidates of all races, she said ""the requirements are the same"" for both reserved and open elections.
The principle of meritocracy ""is not undermined in any way"" in a reserved election because all candidates who take part must still meet the various qualification criteria, she added.
Madam Halimah said she would contest in an open election, but stressed that being elected in a reserved election would not affect her ability to perform her duties.
She also said she hopes a president elected through a reserved election would be seen as someone who represents all Singaporeans.
While Singapore has had success in promoting harmony among the different races, she said, there was still a way to go before race becomes a non-issue at elections.
""At some point, I do hope that in future we may not need a reserved election... but I think the process is still a work in progress. And I really hope that this is how we will look at this reserved election,"" she said.

"," A veteran of four general elections, Madam Halimah Yacob is ready to wage her next campaign - this time for the highest office in the land.
She unveiled her campaign slogan ""Do Good Do Together"" yesterday and introduced key members of her campaign team, who are leaders in various fields including the unions, business and social service.
She described her slogan as a call to action for all Singaporeans, to join her in building an inclusive and progressive community.
The president, as ""one who unites the people"", can set the tone for society and do even more good compared with her previous roles as unionist and politician, she said.
Madam Halimah, 63, added that she will continue serving ""with dedication, passionately and from the bottom of my heart"" if elected, as she has done over nearly 40 years in public service. She will also continue to promote the values she has always advocated - multiracialism, meritocracy and social cohesion.
In a nod to her three decades in the labour movement, two of her nominators are from trade unions; Mr G. Muthukumarasamy, general secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Public Daily Rated Workers, and Ms Mary Liew, president of National Trades Union Congress.
Ms Liew said: ""We can never thank her enough for all the years of contribution to the labour movement, and we will be there for her.""
Unions affiliated with NTUC are expected to rally their members to support Madam Halimah on Sept 13, which is Nomination Day.
Her campaign team also includes Nominated MP Chia Yong Yong, Sheng Siong supermarket chain chief executive Lim Hock Chee, Crescendas chief executive Lawrence Leow and Ain Society chief executive Yusof Ismail.
On why he decided to help the former MP, Mr Yusof said she ""is very down to earth, and she always puts others before self"".
Ms Chia stepped forward as she believes Madam Halimah can help build an inclusive Singapore.
The president of SPD, previously known as the Society for the Physically Disabled, pointed to how her candidate has spoken up for vulnerable members of society, including those with disabilities and the poor.
Also on the team is Singapore Institute of International Affairs chairman Simon Tay, who said he has seen Madam Halimah stand her ground at international conferences, while continuing to engage those with other views.
He said: ""She would have no problems holding up Singapore's flag at the very highest level.""

"," Singaporeans will head to the polls to pick a new president on Sept 23.
Or maybe not.
For just how to go about selecting a successor to Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, who completed his six-year term on Thursday, now hangs in the balance.
Whether there will be an electoral contest, or a walkover on Nomination Day on Sept 13, turns on the decisions of a six-man Presidential Elections Committee, helmed by Public Service Commission chairman Eddie Teo.
The committee's role is to ensure that potential candidates for the job meet a set of qualification criteria set out by Parliament. These aim to ensure that anyone who aspires to the post has the experience, independence and financial nous to play its custodial role of safeguarding the nation's financial reserves and appointments to some key government posts.
Its work takes on greater significance this year since the election is a ""reserved"" one, meaning that for the first time, Parliament has mandated that only members of the country's Malay minority community will be eligible to run. It thought it necessary to do so as Singapore has not had a Malay president since 1970.
Pity Mr Teo. For he now faces the unenviable task of having to decide which of several conflicting principles - each important in itself - he and his committee will uphold, or give more weight to. There is just no pleasing everyone, much as they might try.

"," In a matter of weeks, Singaporeans will elect their eighth president in the first-ever reserved election. Nur Asyiqin Mohamad Salleh brings you an A to Z guide on the presidency and the coming election.
A IS FOR ADVISERS The president's panel of wise men has expanded, and wields more power following changes to the elected presidency passed in Parliament last November.
The president must now consult the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) on all - as opposed to some - monetary matters relating to the reserves, and on key public service appointments.
If the president acts in accordance with the CPA's advice, his veto is final and the Government must abide by it. If he goes against its advice, the Government can bring the matter up to Parliament, which can override the president's decision with a two-thirds majority.
In the light of its heavier responsibilities, the CPA now has eight members, up from six.
After all, as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted: ""The system does not solely rely on the judgment of a single person acting alone but, rather, on the president well advised by a team of wise and experienced men and women.""
B IS FOR BILL The road to a reserved election began in January last year, when PM Lee raised the need for a review of the political system during the first Parliament session since the 2015 General Election.
A Bill to amend the Constitution was passed last November with the backing of 77 MPs, after a Constitutional Commission set out its recommendations on the elected presidency, and after three days of intense debate in Parliament.
All six elected Workers' Party MPs voted against the changes, which include raising the eligibility criteria for presidential candidates, strengthening the Council of Presidential Advisers, and ensuring members of racial minority groups are elected from time to time through a hiatus-triggered reserved election.
The changes were the widest made to the elected presidency scheme in its 26-year history.
C IS FOR COMMUNITY COMMITTEE Are you Malay enough to be Singapore's next president? That decision lies in the hands of the Community Committee, a new feature of the presidential election.
Its first task is to assess whether those hoping to stand in this month's polls are part of the Malay community.
These hopefuls will be informed of the result by Sept 12, after the five members of the Malay community sub-committee deliberate on their applications.
Presidential hopefuls must declare which of the three main communities they consider themselves a part of, and will be issued a certificate if the respective sub-committee agrees.
This process may require the person to provide further information and to be interviewed, among other things.
The Community Committee will be convened even during an open election, and candidates will still have to declare their ethnicity as this will help determine when a reserved election should be triggered.
D IS FOR DIVISIVE ELECTIONEERING Campaign rules have been changed to discourage divisive electioneering.
The authorities, for one, will no longer designate election rally sites.
This is because rallies ""by their nature and format, may be divisive and not congruent with the unifying role of the elected presidency"", as Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing put it.
Candidates can pick their preferred sites, but must apply to the police for a rally permit.
Explaining the changes to campaign rules in Parliament, Mr Chan said: ""Campaign methods for the presidential elections must not inflame emotions and must be in keeping with the decorum and dignity of the Office of the President.""a
E IS FOR ELECTED PRESIDENCY This was almost a decade in the making.
The elected presidency was first mooted by founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1984, but took effect only seven years later, in 1991, after two White Papers were debated in Parliament from 1988 to 1990.
Before that, presidents were appointed by Parliament and served a largely ceremonial role, save for discretionary powers over select matters, such as the appointment of the prime minister.
The elected president, however, is vested with custodial powers over the country's reserves, among other things.
F IS FOR FARID KHAN A school dropout who worked as a grasscutter at age 13 after his father died, Mr Farid Khan now has his eye on the presidency.
He is the chairman of Bourbon Offshore Asia Pacific, a regional marine services company with a reported shareholder equity of around US$300 million (S$407 million). He was the second aspiring candidate to submit the required forms.
It was a long slog up the ranks for Mr Farid, now 61, who spent years taking on a string of blue-collar jobs that ranged from lorry attendant to janitor.
He attributes his success now to Singapore's meritocratic system. For him, the presidency is a way to serve and give back to the nation.
G IS FOR GOALKEEPER This was the role the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew saw the president playing: goalkepeer, the very last line of defence against a rogue government bent on squandering the country's reserves or installing cronies in key public positions.
""You need a wise person in that job to play the goalkeeper, and your council of advisers are fullbacks to prevent stupid people - your own players - from kicking into your own goal,"" said founding prime minister, Mr Lee, in an interview.
This comparison resurfaced over the past year as PM Lee told Parliament that the president is ""neither the government nor is he the opposition"".
""He is a custodian. He's a goalkeeper,"" he said, noting that while the Constitution gives the president power to block certain actions of the government, it does not give him the power to initiate policies.
H IS FOR HALIMAH YACOB For months, she deflected questions by reporters on persistent talk that she would run for election, being one of the few publicly-known Malay candidates who would automatically qualify for the contest.
Madam Halimah Yacob, 63, finally put the flurry of speculation to rest when she announced at a National Day dinner that she would be leaving her party and political posts to stand.
She said then: ""It is a heavy responsibility but I hope that with the support of Singaporeans, we can do more good together.""
Last Wednesday, she became the last known hopeful to submit the necessary forms.
The former Speaker of Parliament and veteran People's Action Party (PAP) MP - who, as a schoolgirl, helped her mother hawk nasi padang to support the family - entered politics in 2001, after a decades-long career with the labour movement.
I IS FOR INDEPENDENT The Constitution dictates that the president be non-partisan and apolitical - and the three aspiring candidates have taken pains to stress their independence.
Businessmen Farid Khan and Salleh Marican point out that they have no ties to political parties, while Madam Halimah Yacob - who has been out of politics for less than a month - says she has always put ""people before party colours"", and has the track record to prove that she does not always toe the government line.
An occasion she cited was when she abstained from voting on amendments to the Human Organ Transplant Act in Parliament in 2007 because she was concerned that this would lead to poor people being persuaded to ""sell"" their organs.
""I know people have that concern because of my past affiliation with the PAP,"" Madam Halimah said. ""But I just want to say that the President has a duty first and foremost to Singapore and Singaporeans, and not to any party.""
J IS FOR 'JUST DO AWAY WITH THE ELECTED PRESIDENCY' Calls emerged during the discussion on changes to the elected presidency to abolish the entire system instead.
The Workers' Party was among these voices, reiterating a stance it has held since the 1980s.
One reason it gave was that the elected president could be an unnecessary alternative power centre.
The WP wanted a return to the former system of appointed, ceremonial presidents, and said it was open to the idea of additional parliamentary mechanisms to safeguard the reserves instead.
It also worried that an elected president could potentially ""cripple"" a non-PAP government, noting that those who qualify to run come from an elite group, and many are ""senior officials appointed under the PAP Government"".
The WP wanted a return to the former system of appointed, ceremonial presidents, and said it was open to the idea of additional parliamentary mechanisms - such as requiring a super-majority vote - to safeguard the reserves instead.
A Constitutional Commission reviewing aspects of the elected presidency also raised the possibility of a return to an appointed president, and hiving off the president's custodial powers to a body of experts.
The Government rejected this, arguing that the holder of the second key needed a direct mandate from the people to have the moral authority to veto a government action.
K IS FOR KEY Two ""keys"" guard Singapore's reserves and the integrity of its public service.
The Government holds the first key, but the president wields the second. He must agree before the Government can dip into past reserves or make key public service appointments.
The first president to turn the second key and unlock past reserves was the late Mr S R Nathan.
During the 2009 financial crisis, the Government sought and obtained his approval to withdraw $4.9 billion from the reserves to fund schemes to save jobs and stabilise the economy.
L IS FOR LEGAL CHALLENGES The elected presidency system came into effect in 1991, part-way into Dr Wee Kim Wee's term as president. This made him the first to be vested with the powers of the elected president - even though he was appointed by Parliament.
The Government therefore started its count of the five terms needed to trigger a reserved election from Dr Wee's term, although it was his successor, Mr Ong Teng Cheong, who was the first president to be elected directly by citizens in 1993.
The elected presidency system came into effect in 1991, part-way into Dr Wee Kim Wee's term as president. This made him the first to be vested with the powers of the elected president - even though he was appointed by Parliament.
This was a sticking point for former presidential candidate Tan Cheng Bock, who this year mounted a legal challenge on the basis of the upcoming election, which is reserved for Malay candidates. Dr Tan believes it is unconstitutional for the Government to start its count from Dr Wee's term.
The case was dismissed - as was Dr Tan's subsequent appeal.
The reasoning was that Parliament has the right to decide when to start the count, and it is a fact that Dr Wee was the first president to exercise the powers of the elected president.
A separate challenge brought by non-practising lawyer M. Ravi was also dismissed.
M IS FOR MADAM PRESIDENT It was the parliamentary gaffe that caused a stir.
During the debate on changes to the elected presidency, Mr Chan Chun Sing mistakenly addressed Madam Halimah Yacob as ""Madam President"" instead of ""Madam Speaker"".
Madam Halimah, in an interview, said: ""I thought I heard it wrong the first time, so I didn't say anything. Then it was mentioned the second time. I almost fell off the chair. I felt very stressed out.
""After the sitting, he told me it was unintended, it was a slip. I accepted his explanation.""
N IS FOR NOMINATION DAY PM Lee started the ball rolling last Monday, when he issued the Writ of Election.
The next stage of the process will be Nomination Day, on Sept 13. Singaporeans get to know then if they will cast their vote or if the election is a walkover.
Nomination Day now has to come at least 10 days after the prime minister issues the Writ of Election instead of five, giving the Presidential Elections Committee more time to scrutinise applications.
Aspiring candidates will be told by Sept 12 whether they qualify, and those who do will have their nomination papers, including their financial statements, made public on Nomination Day. This aims to encourage transparency and discourage hopefuls from exaggerating their credentials.
O IS FOR OUT-OF-OFFICE Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam's time in the Istana has come to an end. His last day as Singapore's seventh president was Aug 31.
He was sworn into office on Sept 1, 2011, following the country's most heated presidential contest yet, beating out three other contenders to win by a narrow margin.

"," Whether Singapore's next president is elected in a contest or a walkover, he or she must be a president for all Singaporeans, said Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary.
But Dr Janil said he did not have an answer to whether a contested or uncontested election was better, a question he was asked during an Institute of Policy Studies forum yesterday on the reserved presidential election.
Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed, a former senior minister of state who was at the forum, noted that the reserved election was introduced to make all Singaporeans feel included.
But it had ""opened a can of worms"", and discussions during the forum showed there is ""a lot of division among Malays, among non- Malays"", said Mr Zainul.
To avoid such divisions, he asked, was it better to have a contest or not have a contest?
It was not lost on the forum's participants that the election, to be held on Sept 23, may be a walkover, as two of the three presidential hopefuls do not immediately meet the criteria to run for the highest office in the land.

Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing on why the Government introduced the reserved election system: ""No good politician will sacrifice his political capital for a problem that may arise in future generations. Most politicians will try to reserve their political capital for themselves to manage their current problems.
We had a conversation with PM Lee. We asked: PM, do we need to do this now?
We anticipated that it will be a hard journey to convince people and we will pay the political price, at least in the short term.
His answer was simply this: Yes, we are likely to pay the political price. Yes, we may not have a problem here and now. But what if we have the problem 20, 30 years from now? Will the fourth, fifth, sixth generation have the luxury of time and space to put in place a system?
He took it upon himself, as the political leader, to put in place a system to pre-empt potential issues from arising in the future. For the country. Not for himself, not for his political capital, but always thinking of the country first.""

"," Singapore's first reserved presidential election all but ended before even getting off the ground, following yesterday's announcement that only Madam Halimah Yacob qualifies to run for office.
Although the 63-year-old is still required to submit her papers on Nomination Day tomorrow, the presidential bids of her potential rivals - Mr Salleh Marican and Mr Farid Khan - have ended. Both men failed as their applications for the certificate of eligibility did not pass muster.
Observers and MPs interviewed said the denouement was an expected, if anticlimactic, end to months of public consultations and forums as well as parliamentary debates about the review of the elected presidency.
From the start, Madam Halimah's name was floated as a possible candidate and, soon, she became the front runner. But they also had mixed feelings about the outcome, acknowledging disappointment at the likely walkover while welcoming the Presidential Elections Committee's decision not to lower the bar.
Many Singaporeans had hoped for the chance to choose their president, said Chua Chu Kang GRC MP Zaqy Mohamad. ""On the one hand, I am very happy for Madam Halimah, as she would make a very good president. But many Singaporeans were hoping for a contest because they felt they had a democratic right to vote.""
ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute fellow Norshahril Saat noted that electoral contests give winners an element of legitimacy and voters the chance to know candidates better through their campaigns.
""A section of Singapore will be upset by the news. But there are certain standards to meet and it is good to disqualify those who did not meet them,"" he said.
Neither Mr Farid nor Mr Salleh qualified under the newly amended stricter criteria. Their companies fell far short of the $500 million shareholder equity threshold spelt out in the Constitution.

"," Meritocracy
"," Meritocracy has been a core principle of Singapore ever since independence.
It has given the underprivileged the opportunity to excel in life, and is a principle that has served us well.
In Singapore, racial harmony is arguably a more important principle than meritocracy, as a chance for an equal footing to succeed in life does not have as wide an appeal if one has to live in fear because of one's race.
When these principles come into conflict with each other, one of them has to be subordinate to the other.
But in the case of the elected presidency, there is no such conflict.
Meritocracy need not take a back seat for the sake of racial harmony, as Singapore's record the past few decades has been sterling.
Putting in place policies that uphold one over the other, to pre-empt concerns in certain communities, can be a slippery slope and may erode the nation's core principles.

"," That Singapore has its second Malay president - after 47 years - shows multiracialism is not just a slogan, said Madam Halimah Yacob, who was yesterday elected unopposed in the country's first reserved presidential election.
In a speech to several hundred supporters, she said: ""I believe that this is a proud moment for Singapore. This is a proud moment for multiculturalism, multiracialism, for our society.
""This shows that multiracialism is not just a slogan - something that is good for us to say, something for people to hear. It means that it really works in our society, that everyone has a chance to reach the highest office of the land.""
This is not just good for now, she added. It will also be good for generations to come because it shows ""very positively how Singapore practises multiracialism"".
Her supporters gathered at the open field in the midday sun at the nomination centre, the People's Association Headquarters, cheering her on with whistles and clappers.
Multiculturalism was on display at the field, where a sea of supporters mostly dressed in orange - the colour Madam Halimah chose for her campaign as it represents unity - whooped with joy as the 63-year- old was declared President-elect.

"," In August 1954, a girl was born in her family home in Queen Street.
She was named Halimah Yacob.
Months later, Singapore held its first Legislative Assembly election. Of the 75 candidates who ran in 1955, only two were women. Both were Chinese, and both lost their contests. And of the 25 men elected, just three were Malay.
What were the odds, then, that a Malay girl, born in August 1954, could one day set foot in Parliament, become Speaker and ultimately be elected Singapore's President? Very long odds, indeed.
When Madam Halimah was sworn in as President yesterday evening, history was made.
The point is presented starkly here because there is a genuine danger we might overlook the significance of this moment - given the controversy surrounding the election.
It is important to acknowledge the controversy: There is a sizeable segment for whom an election reserved for candidates of one race is fundamentally flawed. The lack of a contest compounded the issue for this group.
The changes to the elected presidency, and the timing of the changes, have been debated. The Government has explained the need for the change. The debates will continue for a while longer.

"," Madam Halimah Yacob's father died when she was eight, and she spent her school years juggling studies with work to help her family get by.
Even so, she became the first in her family to enter university, then devoted four decades of her life to public service, speaking up for the vulnerable.
Yesterday, as she was sworn in as Singapore's eighth president, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that her life story - from ""hardship and deprivation"" to success and giving back to society - reflects the Singapore story.
""Your life story symbolises the sort of society that we aspire to be, and reminds us that the Singapore story is one of hope and opportunity,"" he said during a speech at the Istana.
""In Singapore, no matter where we begin in life, if we work hard, we will have ample chances to do well. And when we make good, we have a responsibility in turn to help others around us.""
Madam Halimah, in her speech, attributed this to meritocracy.
Her story is not an uncommon one in Singapore, she said, and similar stories have played out all over the island.
SYMBOL OF HOPE
Your life story symbolises the sort of society that we aspire to be, and reminds us that the Singapore story is one of hope and opportunity. In Singapore, no matter where we begin in life, if we work hard, we will have ample chances to do well. And when we make good, we have a responsibility in turn to help others around us.
PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG , referring to President Halimah Yacob's life story during his speech.
st_20170915_vnf6_3420701.jpg Related Story President Halimah's inauguration: Don't overlook this key moment in Singapore's history ""We firmly believe that anyone who works hard should be able to realise his or her full potential, and make valuable contributions to society,"" she added. ""I have strong personal convictions about our meritocratic system because without it, I would not be here today.""
Recounting how her mother had brought her and her four siblings up single-handedly, Madam Halimah said they experienced poverty and hardship, struggling daily to survive.
""Fortunately, I was growing up in Singapore,"" she said.
Despite her family circumstances, a good education was within her reach as she had the support of family, teachers and the community, and also worked hard.
""That enabled me to launch my career in the public service, and later to give others in need a helping hand,"" she said.
That this is possible is something special and precious to the country, she added.
Her experiences are also an affirmation of Singapore's multiracialism, she said.
She grew up in Selegie House, in a multiracial neighbourhood, and attended the Singapore Chinese Girls' School, studying alongside classmates of all races.
In the unions, where she worked for over three decades, she helped workers regardless of their race.
When she became MP, she looked after the needs of Singaporeans of all races and religions.
The foundations of multiracialism were laid in Singapore's early years and have helped to build a diverse yet cohesive community, said Madam Halimah.
She noted that Singapore's founding fathers, including President Yusof Ishak, understood that multiracialism was not about ignoring or erasing differences between ethnic groups.
""Instead, they recognised our diversity and took steps to reassure every community that they were a unique and valued part of our society,"" she added.
She also said she was glad that multiracialism was not just enshrined in the national pledge, but also entrenched in key national policies like housing, education and security.
As a result, integration in housing and schools is now part of the social landscape, she said.
""Had we left them on their own, they might have taken a different direction.""
But she added that every generation faces new challenges to the country's multiracialism.
""Every generation must update our institutions to strengthen our shared values. And every generation needs champions who care deeply about multiracialism and fight to uphold and realise this ideal,"" she said.
She pledged to be a President for all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language or religion.
Mr Lee said he had no doubt that Madam Halimah will unify all Singaporeans, like Mr Yusof did.
""You, too, will strengthen our sense of nationhood. You, too, will be our President,"" he said.

"," Parliaments
"," New Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin set the desired tone of his tenure when he asked the House to be an institution that ""reflects the voices of the people so that we can query, answer and debate in a manner that provides hope and clarity"". This is a worthy aspiration and one that is essential now - at a particularly crucial juncture in Singapore's economic and social evolution.
In a parliamentary democracy, the judiciary safeguards the Constitution and enforces the law of the land as drawn up by the legislature. The executive conducts the policies and actions of the state, in accordance with the law. And it falls on Parliament to influence and monitor governance, taking into account the interests of the people.
Agreement on the public interest, of course, is difficult at times. Society is defined by a multiplicity of contending needs, wants and demands. The claims of the young on the largesse built for the future contend with the claims of the old on debentures based on achievements of the past. Gender has become an intrinsic, if yet unachieved, part of the quest for equality. Issues of class and ethnicity add layers of complexity to even something as indubitably necessary as meritocracy. Confronted by such divisive issues, Parliament must be the place where debates can take place with clarity and fairness that span all hearts and minds.
To avoid groupthink, the House has to also examine the ""very involved discourse"" taking place outside it, as Mr Tan exhorted. The in-depth information, expertise and awareness evident in different circles mean that discussions in the public domain are also capable of yielding useful feedback and ideas. To be effective, argued Mr Tan, Parliament must tap ""the collective wisdom"" of the public as well, when it analyses contentious issues and points to a direction that would be in Singapore's best interest.
The contest of ideas in a democratic system would inevitably give rise to parliamentarians who are motivated by the need to score points for their parties and themselves. But they should not forget the voters who collectively gave them the privilege to speak on their behalf. The Speaker plays a crucial role in preventing parliamentary politics from degenerating into partisan politicking. Taken to the extreme, that has led to obstructionism, slanging matches and even affrays in the chamber, as seen in other countries.
In Singapore, the hope is that Parliament will serve as a ""beacon"", as Mr Tan put it, that all can rely upon with confidence when pondering weighty concerns. The nation has yet to pass the social test of weathering a terrorist attack. Caring for the aged and the disadvantaged will be challenging if growth slides. And fostering social mobility might prove difficult should income gaps widen. Parliament must continue to focus on the realisable aspirations of the people.

"," History was made at a quarter past six yesterday evening, with the inauguration of Singapore's first Malay President after 47 years, and its first woman head of state.
Looking solemn in a peach- coloured headscarf, President Halimah Yacob, 63, took her oath in the Istana state room, flanked by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon.
Her rise to the highest office of the land reaffirms Mr Lee Kuan Yew's vow in the very early hours of independence on Aug 9, 1965, that Singapore ""would not be a Malay nation, a Chinese nation nor an Indian nation"", PM Lee said in an address to 200 guests.
When this pledge was made, the nation had a Malay head of state: Encik Yusof Ishak, who died in his third term in 1970, at the age of 60.
""President Yusof Ishak symbolised, visibly, that though we had been forced out of Malaysia primarily because we were a Chinese-majority city, independent Singapore would never in turn suppress its own non-Chinese minorities. We chose the nobler dream: A multiracial, multi-religious Singapore.""
""Madam President, half a century later, you symbolise, visibly, that Singapore will persevere with this dream,"" PM Lee said, adding that this has become more urgent in the light of regional and global trends.

""Here, the majority will make extra efforts to ensure that minorities enjoy equal rights. That is something special, precious and fragile.""
I look forward to the day when we will no longer need to rely on the provision to have reserved elections, and Singaporeans naturally and regularly elect citizens of all races as presidents. ''
PRESIDENT HALIMAH YACOB, saying she respected the views of Singaporeans who prefer not to have reserved elections.
PM Lee said this is why Parliament has members from all ethnic groups. Now, the nation will regularly have heads of state who are, like President Benjamin Sheares, Eurasian, like President S R Nathan, Indian; like President Tony Tan, Chinese, and like President Halimah Yacob, Malay, and a woman.
This was the ""compelling reason"" the Government amended the Constitution to reserve the presidency for a community that has not held the post for five terms, he added.
Speaking after PM Lee, Madam Halimah welcomed the move to preserve Singapore's multiracialism.
""I am proud that I belong to a country that does not just say it is diverse, but lives out this diversity every single day,"" she said, adding that while strides have been made, it remains a constant work in progress.
""We need guideposts to help us along this journey,"" she added, as she addressed the palpable disquiet of the past week over her walkover in the first reserved election.
""I know that some Singaporeans would prefer to achieve this without needing reserved elections. I respect their views,"" she said.
""Like them, I look forward to the day when we will no longer need to rely on the provision to have reserved elections, and Singaporeans naturally and regularly elect citizens of all races as presidents.""
""Today, I want to assure all Singaporeans that as your President, I will serve every one of you, regardless of race, language or religion.""
PM Lee noted that the life story of the veteran unionist and former Parliament Speaker reflects the Singapore Story.
Madam Halimah said her life story is a testament to Singapore's meritocracy, a shared value the presidency embodies, together with multiracialism and stewardship.
""I have seen how much we can achieve by working together. Now, as President, my duty is to unite the people, to overcome the many challenges ahead of us, together.
""I pledge to continue this journey of service to our country. I call on all Singaporeans to join me in this endeavour,"" she added.

"," Now that Singapore's first president elected after changes to the system is in office, what issues have emerged from the process? Insight examines three - the reserved election, the walkover and its effect going forward, and the lead time in making the legislative changes.
The presidential election in 2011 is remembered as Singapore's most hotly contested. Four candidates stood in a race that went down to the wire, with Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam finally winning by 0.35 per cent of the votes.
In contrast, the election this year saw Madam Halimah Yacob elected unopposed last week - the third no-contest since elections began in 1993. Before, the president was appointed by Parliament.
Yet, this year's presidential election might go down as among the most hotly discussed.
In the lead-up to it, major changes were introduced to the way the elected presidency works, which resulted in, among other things, the election being reserved for candidates from the Malay community as it has not been represented in the office since 1970.
These changes, as well as the eventual walkover, triggered considerable debate online and in physical forums. In her swearing-in speech last Thursday, President Halimah, 63, acknowledged that some Singaporeans did not agree with the Government on the need to reserve elections.
She sought to be a unifying figure, saying: ""I respect their views.""
Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing, too, had earlier this month noted in a forum the unhappiness in some quarters. He said the Government had been prepared to ""pay a political price"" in the short term when it introduced the changes, because it strongly believed in their long-term benefits.

"," A reminder that Singapore's success is built on intangibles as much as physical development, from former civil service head Lim Siong Guan, reiterates the importance of not taking the obvious for granted. Few who have lived through the transformation of the city-state since the impoverished and lawless 1950s might overlook this fact. But it's easy to be swayed by material gains made over the years. Then, habitual virtues generated by a difficult past can be forgotten in a present that creates an illusory comfort zone.
Mr Lim referred to a sense of honour and a drive to overcome its smallness as examples of intangible assets. Honour manifests itself in the ability of the different communities to respect social differences and maintain everyday harmony. These aspects of honour constitute a substantial part of the Singapore brand name, Mr Lim declared at a recent lecture that he delivered as the Institute of Policy Study's latest S R Nathan Fellow for the Study of Singapore.
His comments underscore the need to retain certain core values, not in spite of Singapore's continuing evolution but precisely because of it. The growth rates made possible by Singapore's entry into the global economy in the 1970s are a matter of the past. That era made possible massive exercises in economic redistribution, none more so than the revolution in public housing policies which sought to turn a nation of sojourners into one of stayers. The transformation of economic life in Singapore in recent times reflects international shifts as well. The entry of China and India into a globalising world, which they once despised or feared, expanded the global market immensely. But this also put pressure on smaller nations to find an interstitial existence in the interplay of great-power economics. Overcoming smallness became an even larger task for an island city-state.
This challenge will persist in a country which must remain a price-taker in international relations. However, it does not have to subvert the sense of common purpose and endeavour which has matured in Singapore over the decades since independence. Singapore's way of life revolving around multiracialism, meritocracy and principled diplomacy must not waver in a global economy undergoing transformation. Realism without and cohesion within define the parameters of Singapore's presence on the world stage.
Branding works only to the extent that others buy into it. They will be convinced of what makes Singapore tick when Singaporeans themselves show they are not at odds. Thus, citizens owe it to themselves to fully appreciate the essence of the nation's brand and to see that constant effort at all levels is required to bolster it. This will be all the more critical amid the ongoing economic disruption and possible social dislocation.

"," After a meal with friends, Singaporeans often fight to pay for the bill ""and belanja everyone"".
While this is not an uncommon sight here, it does not happen as frequently elsewhere, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday as he observed that this style of giving friends a treat is one of the ways Singaporeans show they care for one another.
He was writing on Facebook about an analogy shared by Minister of State Janil Puthucheary at a Kopi Talk dialogue on the theme ""Race, multiracialism and Singapore's place in the world"".
Addressing some 500 grassroots leaders, Dr Janil said his friend from overseas told him people typically pay for their own share when dining with a diverse group, unlike here, where people fight for the bill.
Saying this analogy sums up the theme of the dialogue well, PM Lee said Singaporeans have developed unique ways of caring for one another. But he added that the country's multiracialism is not yet perfect and said it was important to have the honesty to recognise it.
He said: ""But we also need the courage to continue working through our differences, expanding our common spaces, strengthening our ties and, most of all, looking out for fellow Singaporeans.""
The closed-door session, organised by the People's Association, was held at Ci Yuan Community Club in PM Lee's Ang Mo Kio GRC.
STRENGTHENING TIES
But we also need the courage to continue working through our differences, expanding our common spaces, strengthening our ties and, most of all, looking out for fellow Singaporeans.
PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG, on the importance to have the honesty to recognise that the country's multiracialism is not perfect yet.
Also on the panel were Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing and Senior Minister of State Maliki Osman.
PM Lee said the panellists ""shared very personal anecdotes from their own experiences as a Singaporean from the Chinese majority, Malay minority and Indian minority"".
He added that he had chosen the theme for the dialogue because he knew these issues were on the minds of Singaporeans, from their responses to his Facebook posts on the recently concluded Presidential Election and his visit to China.
The Presidential Election this month, won in a walkover by Madam Halimah Yacob, was reserved for Malay candidates following a change to the Constitution to ensure the presidency reflects society's multiracial make-up.
This had sparked discussions about whether the race-based requirement was at odds with meritocracy.
Meanwhile, PM Lee's trip to China in the past week has also brought identity into focus.
In an interview with Singapore media at the end of his trip, PM Lee said that it is important for Singapore to maintain a distinct identity as a multiracial country, even as it shares a cultural affinity with China.

"," Gender pay gap; Wages & salaries; Women
"," The scale of Singapore's gender pay gap may surprise some as, on the surface, there appears to be little discrimination against women, many of whom are well educated, have good jobs and earn good salaries. But the gap between men's and women's pay stands at 18 per cent - little changed from 10 years ago, according to a consumer research firm's analysis of official wage data from 2006 to 2016. A separate study released in March by the National University of Singapore Business School found that female company directors are paid on average a whopping 40 per cent less than their male peers.
Basing salary on gender implicitly denies equal opportunity for all to pursue roles befitting their abilities. Whether due to old-fashioned ideas of men as breadwinners-in-chief and women as primary caregivers, or biases about one gender making for better leaders, the result is unfairness that thwarts meritocracy. Education Minister Ong Ye Kung is right to point out that such stereotypes are ""narrow-minded and damaging, not only to the economy, but to society at large"".
At a time when women's economic participation has to be heightened because of demographic changes, it would be self-defeating to stick to outdated notions of performance and reward. A recent study noted that Singapore will struggle in coming years to offset the decline in the growth of the working-age population by higher labour participation rates. Indeed, the report said Singapore has the most to fear among Asia-Pacific nations which will also have to cope with the effects of ageing on a mass scale.
Holding down women's pay will not help the nation make the most of its human resources. To help change the status quo, Singapore Committee for UN Women president Trina Liang-Lin urged both men and women to shake off the belief that discussing pay is ""taboo and unladylike"". If women dare not speak of pay at job interviews and performance reviews, as most men do as a matter of course, then they risk sabotaging themselves in the fight for wage equality.
Traditionally, women carry the heavier load by keeping the home going, rearing children, and caring for the sick and elderly in the family. This has allowed men to function optimally in the workplace. Women could be similarly productive if social and work arrangements are adjusted so that family and household responsibilities are borne by both genders, flexi-work schedules are devised, and more affordable childcare options are made available. In Nordic countries, more equitable practices have prompted couples to have more babies. Society here must also evolve so that it becomes second nature to put able women as well in demanding positions - yes, including that of the prime minister - and to reward them no differently from men discharging similar duties.

"," President Halimah Yacob yesterday applauded the four self-help groups for working on joint assistance programmes that are open to all races.
Speaking to the media before a dinner hosted for her by the four groups, she cited examples such as tuition classes and after-school care centres.
""It shows that our self-help groups not only reach out to their own communities, but they provide common spaces through providing services that benefit all the communities, and in that manner, they also help to promote the different races coming together in order to support one another,"" she said.
The four self-help groups are: the Chinese Development Assistance Council, Mendaki, the Singapore Indian Development Association and the Eurasian Association.
In her welcome address, Mendaki chief executive officer Rahayu Buang said the ethnic-centric approach that self-help groups started out with allowed them to be more culturally nuanced in the activities they organised for each race. But as Singapore matured and the issues it faced became more complex and cross-cultural, the four groups have also rallied together to help those beyond their own communities, she noted.
This is apt, as many challenges are common to all races: including the struggles of lower-income families, concerns about educational outcomes, and the uncertainties of the future economy, she said.
""It is on this basis that the self-help groups have worked collaboratively to leverage on each other's strengths and expertise,"" she added, listing some of these joint efforts. One is the Collaborative Tuition Programme, launched by the groups in 2002 to allow students to enrol at the tuition centre closest to them, regardless of which group runs it. The programme now boasts 83 centres - up from 11 centres in 2002 - and has benefited more than 97,000 students.
BENEFITING ALL COMMUNITIES
It shows that our self-help groups not only reach out to their own communities, but they provide common spaces through providing services that benefit all the communities, and in that manner, they also help to promote the different races coming together in order to support one another.
PRESIDENT HALIMAH YACOB, on programmes open to all races.
Another joint programme is the Big Heart Student Care Centres, which provide after-school care in primary schools to needy pupils. There are now more than 1,200 pupils enrolled in 15 such centres.
The latest joint effort is the Self-Help Group Centre - slated to open in Yishun in January - where students and adults of all races can attend workshops and enrichment programmes.
Madam Rahayu noted that the President had said in her inauguration speech last month that multiracialism, meritocracy and stewardship are values that will help unify Singapore.
""The self-help groups are fully supportive of these core values as reflected through the work that we do and the collaboration that we seek to forge,"" she said, adding that the groups hope the President would continue to support them in this journey.

"," It's hard to build a national identity that is inclusive. Focusing on who to exclude based on race and religion can be a dangerous short cut.
In the five weeks since Madam Halimah Yacob was sworn in as President on Sept 14, I witnessed two incidents that showed how race continues to colour the way Singaporeans view each other.
The first took place at a concert at which President Halimah was the guest of honour. When she entered the concert hall with her entourage, there was a stir of excitement. Some people whipped out their smartphones to snap photos of her.
A young boy sitting in front of me - intrigued by the adults' reaction and wondering who the celebrity was - climbed up on his chair for a better look. On seeing the President, who was as usual wearing a tudung and on this occasion accompanied by a group of men in batik shirts, he exclaimed to his sister: ""It's just a bunch of Malay people!""
The second incident involved a cab driver zooming past a young Indian man who had flagged his taxi. I was standing nearby waiting my turn, and I had a sense that the cab driver would have stopped for me if I had raised my hand. I chose not to.
During a recent visit to New York City, I had seen cab drivers refusing to pick up a black man. Still, I found it disturbing to see a similar instance of casual racism here in Singapore, and in my neighbourhood.
There is no denying that race and religion shape many people's sense of identity, and how they view and choose to interact with others in society.
Recent events both here and in other countries have also cast a spotlight on how race and religion underpin some people's sense of national identity. These events include the recent federal election in Germany, the presidency of Mr Donald Trump which is now into its 10th month, and closer to home, the plight of the Rohingya people and Singapore's own presidential election.

"," Head of Studies in Inter-religious Relations in Plural Societies (S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies) Mohammad Alami Musa shared his views on extremism, secularism and the need for greater depth in discussions on religion, during a recent inter-faith dialogue held at The Arts House and hosted by a Buddhist organisation. Here is an edited transcript of the question and answer session, which followed his lecture.
Q How can Singapore share its experience of working for social cohesion in a multi-religious society? A According to a study of 232 countries by the Pew Research Centre based in Washington, Singapore is the most religiously diverse country in the world. If there was an Olympics for religious diversity, we would have won the gold medal.
In the last 50 years, there has not been a single religious conflict in Singapore. But this is not the situation in the world today. Pew Research Centre has shown that the number of religious-based conflicts faced by many countries has gone up.
Moving on, things are going to be very challenging. You can see what is happening around us. Religious fundamentalism has gone up. I receive many reports every day on what is happening nearby and in countries not so nearby; I get so nervous looking at these trends.
The worst thing that can happen is when you ""politicise"" religion, and when you ""religionise"" politics. You theologise every problem that you face. Everything is about God, and you have to take a certain position as you want to seek the pleasure of God - there is no compromise.
I think we need to step up. We are still at the lower level of inter-religious engagement and discussion, unlike America, Canada or Britain, where the level of inter-religious dialogue and communication is advanced.
At the intellectual level and the depth of discussion, I think that we are still far behind and we need to quickly do something about it because the next 50 years is about knowledge.
It is not enough for religious leaders to sit around and have a meal and bring the press in and take a photo of them drinking and eating together. That is good, but we need to go beyond that with regard to dialogue and conversation.

"," The research and education arm of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) has launched a new course that aims to help Islamic teachers read religious texts in the context of Singapore's multi-religious society. Titled Islam in Context, it will be offered by the Muis Academy from this month.
It is an abridged version of an existing course - Islamic Thought in Contemporary Plural Societies - offered by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS).
Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim announced this in Cairo on Sunday at a graduation ceremony for 26 Singaporean students at Egypt's renowned Al-Azhar University.
The new course will offer modules that deal with issues such as nurturing inclusiveness, and the need to contextualise Islamic traditions and how to apply them in Singapore's plural society. ""We want our graduates to be kept abreast of current and emerging socio-religious trends and to equip them with tools to contextualise the knowledge acquired,"" said Dr Yaacob in a speech.
The four-week course will be a prerequisite for religious teachers to get accreditation under the compulsory Asatizah Recognition Scheme.
Dr Yaacob, who is Minister for Communications and Information, noted that Singapore is ""faced with the triple threat - of extremist ideology, segregationist beliefs and practices, and Islamophobia"", and strong religious leaders are needed.
These are asatizah ""who possess an expansive worldview, who are able to hold their own against the varied demands of today, while holding strong to their Islamic tenets and beliefs"", he said, adding it was critical that they also have the skills to share their knowledge on social media. They also cannot allow preachers with extremist ideologies to ""hijack and tarnish the good name of Islam as the religion of peace"".
""Instead, we must be confident as a Muslim and uphold the values and attributes of our Singapore Muslim identity, and the principles of multiracialism and meritocracy which are essential to our nation,"" he said.
Dr Yaacob also called on Al-Azhar president Mohamed Hossein Abdel Aziz El Mahrasawy and Grand Imam Ahmed Al-Tayyeb. He travels to Jordan this week, where he will visit higher learning institutions and meet Singaporean students.

"," Structuring national identity around racial affiliations is a recipe for social disaster in a cosmopolitan city. But trying to wish away ethnicity from questions of identity in heterogeneous societies is a naive effort that is likely to fail. Singapore's efforts to acknowledge the reality of ethnicity, while emphasising simultaneously that all are bound by a common destiny, has produced the Chinese, Malay, Indian and Other (CMIO) model.
That framework is not cast in stone but is a means of integrating the different races. It has its shortcomings: for example, it cannot account for the hyphenated identities of children produced by inter-ethnic marriages. However, it is a useful way of conceiving of racial relations - the whole being greater than the sum of its parts - whereas a zero-sum equation might mean the loss of some individual cultural integrity.
The latest indications of the state of relations are provided by an Institute of Policy Studies and Channel NewsAsia study on ethnic identity and inter-ethnic interactions. People were asked how important nearly 40 ethnic identity markers were for consideration as a Singapore Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian. Vernacular language proficiency and the observance of key festivals featured prominently in the answers. Interestingly, about 80 per cent of respondents in each of the three main ethnic groups viewed speaking good English as important to being considered a Singapore Chinese, Malay and Indian. Indeed, this ability was accorded more weight than ethnic lineage and heritage markers, such as tracing one's ancestry. English has become an ethnically neutral link language in a way that would have been inconceivable in colonial Singapore, when it was the language of state power in a plural society which largely identified race with economic function.
The survey reaffirms the anecdotal truth that ethnic identity still resonates with Singaporeans, but not at the expense of their national identity. If anything, nation superseded race when respondents had to choose between the two affiliations. This difference is important especially because the growing power of countries such as China and India, and accompanying prospects of Western decline, could test the sinews of Singapore's multiracial fabric. While the city-state will always be a price-taker in international relations, the price it decides to accept will be determined by the state of ethnic relations within its borders.
The CMIO model will need to evolve accordingly. It should help to develop but not define the Singaporean identity, let alone contain it. As the population grows more diverse, the test of nationalism should transcend racial boundaries and encompass founding values, such as multiracialism and meritocracy, tied to local history, a cosmopolitan culture, and the solidarity produced by the everyday experience of being Singaporean.

"," What lessons can Singapore learn from the problems bedevilling its mass rapid transit (MRT)?
It was interesting that the Prime Minister raised this at the People's Action Party convention last month, considering it was a party meeting and not a government or transport conference.
But it shows how political the issue has become, and how it could, if not satisfactorily addressed, affect the party's chances at the next general election due by 2021.
To outsiders, this might be hard to comprehend. It's not as if the country is facing a corruption scandal, or large unemployment or civil unrest.
Trains breaking down?
Governments have not been known to be rattled by such mundane issues.
But Singapore's MRT problems are not straightforward either, because they are not just technical or engineering in nature but have to do with other issues such as corporate culture, the running of state-owned companies and the politics of public transport.

"," Over the past decade, government spending more than doubled from $33 billion to $71 billion - and is set to increase further. Ahead of Budget Day on Feb 19, Insight looks at where spending demands are greatest: healthcare, infrastructure and jobs. The first of a three-part series, this week's feature examines Singapore's social policies, and pressing issues in healthcare.
Shaping policy in response to social needs is an ever-challenging - and changing - process. Just ask Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.
Back in the mid-1990s when the Internet age was starting, many families were worried that their children would lose out because they could not afford computers.
The Government's solution: it would ""socialise"" computer use.
Public computers would be installed in schools and community centres, announced the Education Ministry's deputy secretary (policy) - Mr Tharman. There would be no subsidies for low-income families, he said then.
But as the Internet took off, this stance later changed. Government initiatives expanded to include subsidies for needy students to buy new computers and to subscribe to Internet broadband.
This flexibility to adapt to changing needs can be seen nowadays in the move to increase social spending for an inclusive society that gives the needy a leg-up. It stands in contrast to earlier years of nation-building, where the emphasis in social policy was self-reliance.
VIBRANT ECONOMY IS KEY
The most important way we can provide for social well-being across the full span of the population is to have a vibrant economy.
MR THARMAN
In an interview with Insight, Mr Tharman,who has been the Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies since 2015, says:
""It's in the last decade that you see a decisive shift, a deliberate tilt, towards tempering the inequalities of life and ensuring the lower-income group keeps pace with the whole society as it moves up.""
He outlines some of the key milestones: Workfare in 2007, which supports older low-wage Singaporeans who continue working and training; the Progressive Wage Model in 2012, which sets wage floors for workers' skill levels; SkillsFuture in 2015, which encourages lifelong learning; and MediShield Life, also in 2015, a health insurance plan helping to pay for costly hospital bills and treatments.
With such moves, social expenditure - which covers healthcare, education and social and family development, among others - ballooned to about $34 billion in 2016, from $12.7 billion a decade earlier. Last year, it comprised $37.8 billion - half of total government spending.
Experts agree there has been a shift to the left in Singapore's social policies - in terms of wealth redistribution - although they disagree as to the extent.
In the past, social support tended towards short-term aid for the unemployed, the ill, those with disabilities and the needy old, says National University of Singapore (NUS) economist Chia Ngee Choon, noting: ""There was an aversion towards welfarism as it was feared that this may lead to a 'crutch mentality'.""
But there was a growing acknowledgement that not everyone was benefiting from Singapore's economic growth. Some were falling way behind.
The 2005 Household Expenditure Survey showed that while average income for households rose 1.1 per cent annually from 1998 to 2003, those in the bottom 20 per cent saw their incomes fall 3.2 per cent a year in the same period.
By contrast, the Household Expenditure Survey in 2014 found that the income of those in the bottom 20 per cent rose at the highest rate of 6.6 per cent annually from 2008 to 2013, even as average monthly household income increased by 5.3 per cent annually.
AN AGEING, STRATIFYING NATION The work is far from done, says Mr Tharman.
The big challenges that Singapore faces are slowing social mobility and ageing, he says.
""They will be with us for a long while. They are not one-off challenges, not challenges for 10 or 15 years. They are challenges for decades to come.""
His comments come amid sobering data.
One in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above in 12 years' time - by 2030. The figure today is about one in eight.
This dramatic shift in the population make-up is already propelling healthcare spending upwards, says Mr Tharman.
""Healthcare is the biggest challenge for the future of social spending. It's the fundamental reason why we need to raise more revenues, and why we have to spend effectively,"" he adds.
Other data also makes for grim reading. While Singapore's Gini coefficient - a measure of income inequality - fell to its lowest level in a decade in 2016, at 0.458, it remains one of the most unequal among developed societies. A lower coefficient suggests a more equal distribution of incomes.
Another set of statistics underscores the same trend.
The average monthly household income from work per household member for the top 10 per cent was $12,773 in 2016, over 23 times the $543 earned by those in the bottom 10 per cent of households.
In the year 2000, the corresponding figure for the top 10 per cent was $5,801, 18 times that of the $315 of those in the bottom 10 per cent.
As societies become more settled and class divisions firm up, one's starting advantage becomes a lasting advantage, says Mr Tharman. ""It's true in every mature society, and the same can happen to us.""
The Singaporean identity rests on the fact that everyone has a fair chance to move up the rungs of society, he notes, but it will take harder work to sustain this.
IS A TRAMPOLINE ENOUGH? Asked by a BBC journalist at a gathering in Switzerland three years ago if Singapore believed in the notion of a safety net for those who fall between the cracks of a successful economy, Mr Tharman bounced back with a rejoinder that had the audience laughing, then applauding: ""I believe in the notion of a trampoline.""
During the interview, he elaborates. It is about helping people ""with a difficult start"" discover their own strengths - whether it is by helping them stay in work with Workfare, building their skills or helping them own their homes.
""This strengthens personal responsibility, and strengthens the sense of pride people get from contributing to their own lives and to society,"" he says. ""That, I think, is the crucial social ethic that we've got to maintain. That is the Singapore approach, it can be done, and we've got to make sure that we sustain that into the future.""
ST_20180128_YSHEALTH28A_3719618.jpg Related Story Tailoring future hospitals to elderly patients' needs However, observers have also made the point that people at times make poor choices due to poor options.
Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) head of sociology Teo You Yenn notes in her new book This Is What Inequality Looks Like that a single mother, for instance, may find it tough to stay in her job due to a lack of childcare options.
Insight puts it to Mr Tharman that in such cases, people may be trying their hardest to bounce up on the metaphorical trampoline but are being hobbled by a broken ankle.
The Deputy Prime Minister responds that he does not mean that people have equal options.
Instead, a trampoline refers also to support from community networks: teachers, parents' support groups, friends and peers who help galvanise people with ""a spirit of aspiration"".
This, together with government help - Mr Tharman hints that KidStart, a pilot programme to give targeted attention to low-income pre-school children, will become ""a major intervention"" - will help people take ""personal responsibility"".
He warns: ""If we do not sustain a culture of personal responsibility, you will get over time what we see now in several mature societies, which is a hardening of attitudes towards the poor.""
For example, United States President Donald Trump last year sought to balance the federal budget with unprecedented cuts to programmes for poor and working-class families.
Yet, how much community support do the disadvantaged get, given that studies have shown a divide in social networks. A recent Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) survey found that someone who attended a non-elite school has ties to just 0.4 people who went to an elite school.
For Mr Tharman, what is key is avoiding ""a culture of elitism"". He exhorts: ""Everyone must take a real interest in others in different stations of life from them. That's critical.""
On whether that is happening enough in Singapore, he notes: ""There is a risk that it will get eroded over time, and we have to work harder at it.""
Can the Government also do more to enforce social mixing in its policies, for instance, in re-siting schools from the exclusive Bukit Timah enclave or in scrapping admission policies that entrench advantages across generations?
What is more important, responds Mr Tharman, is that schools around the island must offer quality: ""Just assigning brand-name schools around the island doesn't itself do it.""
CAN MORE BE DONE? While observers welcome what has been achieved over the past decade, more can be done, they say.
What is needed, argues Associate Professor Donald Low at NUS' Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, are universal schemes that better protect all workers - and not just low-income ones - from the pain of restructuring.
""Increasingly, we're going to find that people are moving a few times over the course of their careers, often into entirely new areas, because of the pace of technological and business model disruptions,"" says Dr Low.
Mr Tharman says that a critical policy on this front is SkillsFuture, which helps people reskill throughout their lives.
""It serves the needs of an innovative economy, but it is fundamentally a social strategy, too,"" he says, adding that this will go some way to help with social mobility.
""It is about becoming a meritocracy of skills, not one based on grades you earn early in life.""
But re-training should not be the only measure for this affected group, say academics.
Dr Low and IPS sociologist Mathew Mathews want a form of unemployment insurance to help workers tide over periods of job loss. Workers get payouts when they are rehired, giving them a greater incentive to take on new jobs.
As Singaporeans age, there are also growing calls for more of their healthcare needs to be taken care of - for instance, by putting in place a comprehensive insurance system for all ailments.
There is a particular need to help those who may have retired without enough savings - having spent their working years at a time where incomes and the cost of living were lower, says governance expert Neo Boon Siong of NTU.
""Today, the cost of living is high relative to the amount of savings they have,"" he notes. ""How do you address the issue of equity?""
WHO PAYS? As Singaporeans age, more will be done to care for them, says Mr Tharman. Money will then have to be raised. He puts it starkly thus: ""There is no such thing as free healthcare in the world"", as the bill is ultimately paid via taxes and insurance premiums.
Currently, the Government pays 70 per cent of the costs in the subsidised healthcare system. On whether the Government has ascertained that as the optimal level, he says that there is ""no precise figure that we will claim to be optimal"".
What is key is striking the right balance of individual spending, insurance and government subsidy collected through taxes, he says.

""If you rely too much on insurance, where insurance is not just for big hospital bills like in MediShield Life but is much more comprehensive, then you get a problem of doctors overprescribing or the system gets overused.""
With the Japanese universal health insurance system, for example, people visit physicians thrice as often as in other advanced countries and stay in hospitals two or three times longer, he says.
""We will continue tweaking it,"" Mr Tharman says of the balance.
Another issue Singapore stands firm on is the idea that subsidies and benefits must be targeted. ""If everyone rich or poor gets the benefit of free healthcare, as your society ages, it becomes unaffordable,"" he says.
Finland, for instance, has a universal system where rich and poor get benefits. And it is getting harder to afford as the population ages, he says. This has led to cutbacks in other areas such as higher education, with young people leaving the country.
NOTHING IS SACROSANCT Ask Mr Tharman what scope there is for the Government to review its thinking on ""sacred cows"" - and he maintains that there are none.
There have long been robust calls for policies such as a minimum wage - which have just been as vigorously dismissed. Economist Lim Chong Yah, founding chairman of the National Wages Council, has advocated for a legislated minimum wage, arguing that Singapore had swung too much towards growth at the expense of equity in the last decade or so.
Asked whether the Government's stance could shift, Mr Tharman says: ""If we come to a point where our current approach no longer leads to broad-based income growth, and that you find that year after year, the bottom 10 per cent, bottom 20 per cent, is slipping further away from the rest of the population, then we may need new approaches.""
bp_seniors_280118_1.jpg Related Story More home-based care options likely for seniors But so far, these lower-income groups have had ""as fast or faster income growth"" as the rest of the workforce, he points out.
""The most important way we can provide for social well-being across the full span of the population is to have a vibrant economy,"" says Mr Tharman.
In a Cabinet which devotes long hours to debating issues, ""nothing is sacrosanct"", states the minister.
He cites the Progressive Wage Model - which sets the minimum wages of low-wage workers in certain jobs - which he says would not have been introduced 20 years ago. ""But we did it, because even with jobs being available for all, even with a relatively healthy economy, we found that some workers were not being fairly treated - particularly in industries where there was a lot of outsourcing.""
Asked if the idea that nothing is sacrosanct is a thinking that permeates throughout the Cabinet, he replies: ""I would say so.
""We take a practical approach towards social and economic policy, not embedded in ideology.""
With Singapore caught up in the issue of leadership succession, Insight asks: Is it an approach that the next generation of leaders have as well?
Mr Tharman bounces back with: ""Very much so. They have open minds.""

Edited by Ho Kwon Ping and Arnoud De Meyer World Scientific/ Hardcover and paperback/ 228 pages/$62.05 (hardcover); $29.90 (paperback)/Both versions are sold at The SMU Shop; the paperback version is sold at major bookstores
3 stars
The Art Of Leadership is an uneven collection of lectures on this topic given by world leaders, who were invited to speak at Singapore Management University over the past 15 years or so.
Diplomatic platitudes are interspersed with gems of insight.
In these pages, some statesmen dutifully extol virtues such as meritocracy and a respect for markets.
Their cautious speeches look as dull as a pile of pebbles next to the glinting intelligence of thinkers such as American political philosopher Francis Fukuyama.
In a lecture in 2014, Dr Fukuyama posits a string of sparkly ideas, such as ""getting to Denmark"", where the Scandinavian country becomes a symbol for a prosperous, democratic, well-governed state.
In some quarters, Denmark can also be viewed as the aspirational hope for a failing state like Somalia.
The problem, Dr Fukuyama says, is that ""the Danes themselves do not know how Denmark came to be"". The long process of creating Denmark's political institutions is arguably lost in the mist of the past.
Contrary to received wisdom, Dr Fukuyama also theorises that the first modern state, formed through unremitting military competition, was invented in China - 1,800 years before Europe.
The interest in this book lies not only in such ideas, but also in how proclamations of the past are viewed through the lens of the present.
Dr Fukuyama, who famously and falsely proclaimed The End Of History in the 1990s, with the apparent triumph of Western liberal democracy, ironically comes across as fresh as a daisy.
What is intriguing are views such as those espoused by Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi, who faces censure internationally over her silence in the Rohingya issue.
In a speech in 2013, she says: ""I do not think that soldiers should become politicians.""
The phrase shines an equivocal light on the strong military influence in Myanmar, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have been targeted by soldiers.
Ms Suu Kyi also says that ""leadership means convincing those who you aspire to lead that the way you have chosen is the right one"".
It is curious how the past insists on intruding into present-day politics. The path she has chosen does not seem clear to the outside world.
Once, people may have wondered at how she endured years of house arrest and not being beside her husband when he died.
Here, Ms Suu Kyi seems more of an enigma than ever, seemingly haunted by her own words.

"," Trust - that perennial issue - has been in the news again in recent weeks.
Last November, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong stressed the need for the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) to maintain the trust of citizens. Speaking at the PAP party convention, he said: ""The PAP earned the people's trust the hard way, and we must never take it for granted or fritter it away.""
More recently, Minister Chan Chun Sing returned to the theme, in a speech on Jan 11 when he stressed the need for exceptional leadership that is able to build trust with Singaporeans, and in an interview with my colleague, Straits Times editor Warren Fernandez, last week.
Like PM Lee, Mr Chan warned against a trust deficit developing in Singapore. Mr Chan diagnosed that trust erodes if citizens feel their lives have not improved; and if they feel their government - or the media in this era of ""fake news"" - was not honest in their statements or efforts on how to improve citizens' lives.
He summed it up aptly: ""The first question is a question of competence, the second is a matter of integrity.""
He also stressed that leaders should be forthright and honest about the challenges and options facing the country.
That view of trust and its importance is something many Singaporeans will agree with. As Mr Chan has noted, founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew once described the trust between government and people as the greatest asset.
But I also wonder if Singapore's leaders have listened hard enough to another group of Singaporeans - the one with deep-seated gripes about the Government - or simply waved their concerns aside.
"," Has trust in the government been eroded? It's time to talk frankly:   Leaders talk of maintaining trust, but some say trust has already been eroded. Time to talk frankly.

"," [SINGAPORE] A fine balancing act lies ahead for the government as it plans to groom more Singaporeans for top positions and specialist roles in the finance industry, while keeping an eye on the entry of foreigners to the sector.
From what industry observers say, the move is a positive one for the future, though there may not be a deep enough local talent pool at this point to staff certain functions.
In a speech on Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam outlined plans to help Singaporeans gain specialist know-how and international exposure to prepare them for bigger roles in the industry. If necessary, the government will raise employment pass standards to manage the inflow of foreigners.
To Edmund Koh, CEO of UBS Singapore and UBS wealth management Singapore and APAC hub, what matters most is meritocracy. ""I firmly believe in an environment where the best compete. Whether they are locals or foreigners, it really doesn't matter,"" he said.
Recruiters noted that there are more foreigners in call centres and other roles such as trading, audit, product control, business analytics and banking IT.
There are no publicly available figures on the proportion of foreigners in the banking and finance industry and estimates vary. Randstad regional director (Singapore & Malaysia) Karin Clarke believes that 40 per cent are foreigners.
Robert Walters Singapore financial services division manager Finian Toh reckons that foreigners and permanent residents (PRs) take up 30 per cent of mid-level posts and 60-70 per cent of senior level jobs.
""The banking and finance industry has a higher portion of foreigners relative to other industries as it is one of the fastest growing industries in the past five years, and the supply of local talent has been unable to match up to increasing demands,"" said Towers Watson Singapore global data services manager Sean Paul Darilay.
UBS's Mr Koh said his work experience abroad had helped him in his career. The Singaporean was previously president of Taiwan's Ta Chong Bank for three and a half years and also held senior positions in DBS Bank, Citibank and other financial institutions.
Mr Koh said he knows of other Singaporean bankers who are doing well. ""A lot of my peers can actually stand shoulder-to-shoulder among the best in the world.""
But recruiters noted that there are not enough Singaporeans who can fill jobs in specialised areas such as quantitative finance and risk management.
And it is not just a matter of supply - there are certain roles which may be more suited for foreigners. Banks may hire staff from Korea to serve and build a rapport with Korean clients, for instance.
""The key is to be able achieve a balance between the need for foreign talent and making sure there are sufficient development opportunities for the locals,"" said Hugues Delcourt, ABN Amro Singapore country executive and private banking Asia head.
ABN Amro employs about 400 people in Singapore, of which some 80 per cent are Singaporeans. Its private banking arm looks for relationship managers from diverse backgrounds to cater to different clients' needs, he said.
The bank is looking for talent for its energy, commodities and transportation and clearing businesses but they are sometimes hard to come by locally and ""we have to recruit from foreign shores to fill the gaps"".
Market watchers highlight that foreign talent can help raise standards in the industry and their roles are especially important in market segments new to Singapore.
""For areas that require very specialised skills sets, we hire top talent to set up teams in Singapore and locals who may get to work in these teams benefit from the specialised training and knowledge transfer,"" said Standard Chartered Singapore CEO Ray Ferguson. The bank has over 7,000 staff based in Singapore, of which 75 per cent are Singaporeans and PRs.
While the government's move will be noticed, it is unlikely to affect foreigners' perception of Singapore as a place to work, recruiters said.
They expect foreigners to continue looking for work here, especially as Western economies show no signs of recovering sharply anytime soon.
What may stop them in their tracks is banks' tighter budgets. Banks are realising that a heavy reliance on foreign workers is not sustainable or cost effective in the long term, Randstad's Ms Clarke said.
""This is particularly relevant when you consider that banks are under huge pressure to reduce their operating costs and produce better returns to their shareholders.""

Jeffrey Goh CEO NETS
I'D hesitate to compare social media with the proverbial silver bullet that is the answer to all problems. Internally, social media can help to foster collaboration among a workforce but employees must know what the boundaries are. Too open and the company risks having all its secrets out in the marketplace; therefore, some parameters are required to strike a balance.
That said, no company can afford not to embrace social media and it is particularly useful for engaging customers. They can provide us real-time information, feedback on what they are happy or unhappy with, and that gives you the opportunity to respond, correct and retain. Our NETS Facebook page enables us to have a conversation with our customers and to win them over again and again.
Seah Kian Peng CEO (Singapore) NTUC FairPrice Cooperative Ltd
SOCIAL media has changed the way that organisations engage their stakeholders. It is an imperative and essential platform, and those who ignore it do so at their own peril.
Being constantly connected to stakeholders through social media means that organisations must be ready to connect with them on a personal level by actively participating in their lives. While this creates new opportunities for engagement, it has also upped the urgency for greater transparency.
FairPrice recognises these factors and has leveraged social media to better engage stakeholders through blogs, Facebook and even iPhone applications. As an active user myself, I am able to communicate directly with stakeholders and better engage them on what FairPrice has to offer them.

THE progressive use of social media at Shell reflects the need for more social, human and transparent communication about our industry.
Energy is a complex industry that affects every person on the planet, and requires a great deal of education and exchange with people of all ages, cultures and in all countries, to progress. We are using social media to facilitate an open dialogue with people at a global and local level to share viewpoints and address concerns on energy challenges and opportunities.
The fact that we have attracted over 1.5 million followers on Facebook in the first four-and-a-half months reflects the global leadership of Shell as an innovative energy company and the willingness of the public to actively engage in the energy conversation.
Janet Ang Managing Director IBM Singapore
TODAY, ''social'' has become a business imperative for the C-Suite. In IBM's 2012 CEO Study, the 1,700 CEOs interviewed recognised that technology has become the No 1 driver of change for their businesses.
With the proliferation of mobile devices and apps today, there is an opportunity for business to embed ''social'' in all its processes as social tools connect people to people, people to information and data to insight.
An enterprise social business does this by engaging employees, clients and partners in a two-way dialogue, increasing transparency, facilitating collaboration and creating a platform for innovation.
CEOs know that they need to take the lead to set their enterprise's ''social'' agenda.
Joshua Soh Country Manager for Singapore and Brunei Cisco
CISCO's research indicates that social media is a big part of our lives, with 73 per cent of employees aged 21-29 accessing Facebook at least once a day. With the potential to be a powerful medium to connect companies, employees and customers, organisations looking to use social media need to take a proactive stance in shaping and driving this engagement.
For example, at a recent product launch, we used social media to help reach 90 times the customers at one-sixth the cost of a similar launch. Internally, we have a clear social media policy coupled with a host of employee training and customer initiatives.
Ultimately, achieving success requires senior management to not only understand social media, but to also listen and engage in the conversations that are taking place.
Toby Koh Group Managing Director Ademco Security Group
WE have trod carefully into social media and thus far, it appears that our client base does not like to be engaged on such a platform but prefer a more personal approach.
We have found much greater success in our internal social media platform. Ademco uses Chatter which is a private social media platform for our staff across the Asia regional offices to use and collaborate. Different interest groups are set up by staff for specific purpose like marketing, technology updates, work flow improvements etc. Many of our staffers have the Chatter app installed on their iPhones, iPads and Android phones. One clear benefit is the speed of knowledge transfer and sharing across all our offices. For example, a technical question posted on Chatter would be resolved within hours and not days as it reaches out to tap upon all the engineering experience available in our group instantly.
There is no doubt that social media is here to stay, and all companies have little choice but to study the most effective way to embrace it.
The CEO is ultimately the person to set, endorse and lobby the usage of social media within the organisation.
Lim Teck Yin CEO Singapore Sports Council
NAVIGATING social media is a modern version of navigating a labyrinth, with increasing layers of ever-changing complexity. The rate at which data is made available to consumers by consumers presents a considerable challenge for us to build an online presence. YouTube users upload 48 hours of new content every minute of every day. The onus is on us to change with the times if we are to stay relevant in the minds of our stakeholders.
Among the recommendations in Vision 2030 (the national sports project) was a call to expand our use of new technologies and media to enhance the sporting experience for everyone. We're taking that advice to heart.
Derek Seow Regional Vice-President - Asia Gartner
SOCIAL media has opened the door, enabling business leaders to think differently about how they engage and interact with both customers and employees. Gartner predicts that by 2014, refusing to communicate with customers via social channels will be as harmful as ignoring e-mails or phone calls today. Social media enables leaders to access the social dimension within and outside their organisation and also to listen.
Now we need to move beyond simple social media solutions such as Facebook, blogs etc to change the way that our organisations work and to find new answers to our current and future challenges.
Leon Perera Chief Executive Officer Spire Research & Consulting Group
SPIRE uses social media platforms to define and discuss early-stage market trends or ''bellweather'' market phenomenon, involving clients and employees in the conversation. By being selective about what we highlight, we distance ourselves from the ''broadcast overload'' that is a concern with business usage of social media today. These contributions also create an interactive platform for employees, clients and partners to share opinions and first-hand market observations across all the countries where Spire operates, enabling the formation of a regional view about cutting-edge trends.
The CEO's role here is crucial in championing adoption as well as providing thought leadership to ensure that the firm's social media activities genuinely add value rather than being disguised advertising.

Key contributors are recognised as ''gurus'', and inquiries are dynamically routed to them.
JustAsk is a big hit at TCS, and word of it is fast getting around. In fact, just recently, TCS's leading social media guru briefed an SMU MBA class on JustAsk - all done via social media.

BUSINESS leaders today need to recognise that the rapid maturity of social media is a game-changer for communication and interaction between companies and their stakeholders. Social media today is not just for youth-related businesses, but is a credible business catalyst. At CA Technologies, we view social media as a powerful tool to stimulate co-creation of ideas with internal and external stakeholders. Globally, we have invested in creating and maintaining social media assets across blogs, Twitter channels and social networking platforms to connect better with colleagues, partners, customers and industry peers.
I have seen many transformational CEOs in Asia today fully recognising and embracing social media as a business catalyst. These business visionaries do not necessarily need to write blogs or have thousands of Facebook friends, but they have laid out long-term directions and clear boundaries for social media platforms and technologies to be embraced in a controlled manner that is ultimately aligned with business growth strategies.
Jessica Tan Managing Director Microsoft Singapore
SOCIAL computing has made a huge impact on how we connect with information and each other. Businesses are just starting to take advantage of the benefits of social computing, and I believe that it will redefine how we'll work together in the years ahead.
Engaging with our employees, customers and partners through social media has proven to enable us to better understand their needs and sentiments. It's a two-way street, so they have the opportunity to hear from us directly too. In this world of information overload and noise, it is critical to engage with an increasingly discerning audience and to enable them to be empowered to collaborate and innovate.
John Lim Group CEO ARA Trust Management (Suntec) Ltd
THERE is a convergence of the Internet, Web 2.0, and mobile technologies that has created a disruptive shift in business. Social Media has evolved to play an increasing and crucial role in shaping opinions, spreading new ideas and changing the business environment, with seamless group interaction and collaboration happening 24/7. In this regards, social media is already impacting key business areas such as transparency, collaboration and innovation; traditional mainstream media is slowly being supplanted for marketing and communication purposes; and information is no longer contained.
CEOs will have to take advantage of the new social media phenomenon to engage its main constituencies - investors, partners and staff. CEOs will also need to provide the leadership to invest in social media infrastructure and recognise this paradigm shift in how business may operate differently.
At ARA, we have started reviewing our investor relations and communication platform to see how we can use the new social media and networks to engage our staff and investors better. At the same time, corporate governance and confidentiality are critical in the fund management business. Thus, there would still have to be limits and controls in how information is shared.
Ryan Lim Founder and Business Director Blugrapes
SOCIAL media has the ability to break new business ground where consumers can be directly involved to influence the design and outcome of new products and services. However, this new-found benefit comes with a price as crowd-sourced projects may fall into the problem of accounting for copyright ownership. So who truly owns the intellectual property of the final product?
Beyond product and solution development, social media helps facilitates the communication of business direction while encouraging open exchange of ideas and opinions. CEOs can now cast a clearer strategic vision without limitations to the size of their companies.
Rob Bratby Managing Partner Olswang
THE development of social media represents a sea change in the way that both individuals and businesses connect. Used properly, social media can be very effective in engaging on a personal and professional level.
Within the corporate environment, it is essential that the CEO sets a positive example through his or her use of social tools. Social media has been invaluable in helping us increase awareness and understanding in the region. Our team, myself included, regularly blog and use tools such as Twitter and LinkedIn to complement face-to-face meetings and other traditional methods such as e-mail.
Companies that have not yet established themselves on these platforms need to take a look, work out what they want to achieve and ensure that everyone - from the CEO down - is fully on-board with creating a positive social presence.
Bob Pickard President and CEO, Asia-Pacific Burson-Marsteller
SOCIAL media makes it possible for a company to create a mass quantity and deep quality of customised connections with the communities important to its business success. Digital networks are tearing down the wall between ''internal'' and ''external'', and in so doing, are blurring the lines between marketing, human resources and customer service. People don't just expect to have a passive connection with companies, they are insisting on active relationships.
Savvy CEOs can use social networks to personify their brands online, making it possible for corporations to act like people with a personality rather than like things with merely an image.
George McFerran Managing Director, Asia-Pacific eFinancialCareers
AS a leading global career site network for professionals in the financial services industry, eFinancialCareers' business is all about leveraging the border-less nature and reach of the online world to match prospective employees and employers. Social media has enabled us to ''mix it up a little'', peppering jobs-related information with lifestyle information that individuals - especially those in the financial services industry - can relate to. It has worked well for us with our Asia-Pacific Facebook page garnering more than 5,000 fans and counting.
The collaborative nature of social networks not only provides direct engagement with our audience, their feedback to non-work postings gave us valuable insight on how we should approach topics on the professional front, giving us an edge in reaching out to the prospective job-seekers.
Andrew Pumphrey Managing Director AsiaRooms.com
THE exponential growth of social media as an influencing factor in our lives and how businesses operate has been amazing. As a leader in the online travel accommodation industry, AsiaRooms.com cultivates all touch-points and channels to build affinity with our customers. We see our social media platforms as a natural extension of our website. They are great channels for us to provide information on the best deals that we have, as well as for us to connect and get to know our customers better.
The inherent transparency of social media also aligns to the genuine room reviews that we offer on our website, and our very own dedicated YouTube travel and room review series, The Right Room. We're happy that our Facebook page has more than 70,000 fans in a relatively short time. It is my belief that visitors spend the most time with brands such as ours where they can voice and share their opinions. If we continue to engage with our customers in a meaningful way, they will stay around longer. And the longer and more frequently they do this, the more they interact with us and get to know AsiaRooms.com better.
Thus, leaders and organisations will do well in continuing to embrace social media and open conversations.
Greg Moore Managing Partner Huthwaite Asia-Pacific
PERSONALLY, I like to keep my finger on the market and industry pulses worldwide. In addition to business news, I find social media an invaluable and easy way to keep up to date with trends, competitors and - most importantly - our clients and employees.
Take our Huthwaite sales performance group for example. Our employees and clients are contributing articles, asking questions and commenting on a daily basis. Not only are we seeing differing opinions and solutions from our followers and clients, but our own sales employees are reading these ideas and incorporating them into their own sales methods.
Julian Quinn Vice-President, Asia-Pacific Adobe Systems Incorporated
MAINTAINING a significant digital presence to reach our audience is critical to Adobe's marketing and sales strategy; and over the past years, social media has become a major element of that digital mix. We've invested time and resources to build local communities across Asia where our customers can learn more about the technology and how to use it, find out about local events and promotions, get a quick response to questions or issues they may have, or simply share their creative ideas and work. For creative professionals, students and amateurs alike, that's really important.
As head of Adobe in Asia-Pacific, I've watched with great interest our communities grow over the past couple of years and watched engagement levels steadily rise as people start communicating with us. I really enjoy the immediacy and honesty of the conversations on our social platforms.
After a new product launch, such as the recent Creative Suite 6 launch, or after a major event, I can get an instant sense of what people think about it, how they're reacting, and if there are any issues or problems that need to be actioned and resolved. My leadership approach has always been to spend as much face time with customers as possible to learn about their business and their needs.
Adobe's social communities now present new insights and opportunity to discover what our customers think and want, and that's invaluable.
Paul Endacott Managing Director, Singapore Ambition
WHILE Facebook and Twitter have clearly revolutionised the way that we share information, neither has asserted itself fully as an external communications channel in the business services world. However, LinkedIn has become an important tool for the recruitment industry and improved the way that we operate. It is a basic expectation these days that an organisation has some form of social media framework for employment branding purposes.
If the CEO is seen to champion this, it reflects a degree of commitment from the organisation to social media; and that it is a progressive employer.

AS a global agency focusing on digital communications, we strongly encourage all leaders to have an online presence - and this applies to us as well. I'm fairly active on Twitter and LinkedIn, as well as our internal collaboration networks, and it helps not only to reinforce our company's overall digital communications message, it also results in more opportunities for us via inbound marketing.
In addition to developing our own profiles as company leaders, we also actively counsel and train C-suite executives in improving and maximising their online presence to help achieve both business and leadership goals.
Social media is a very powerful tool that can help leaders in almost any organisation, regardless of business function. It's a chance to be better understood, engage directly, amplify philosophies, and most importantly, create a connection with key stakeholders ranging from customers to vendors, partners, regulators and of course employees. And that's just for the business leader themselves.
For the organisation, online collaboration tools can foster camaraderie, spawn great ideas and promote openness - and much more than just goodwill, we are seeing a lot of great ideas and business initiatives result.
For instance, IBM, which is a key client for us globally, regularly hosts online collaboration events with its employees, which have resulted in incubator businesses and even global corporate initiatives.
CEOs need to both endorse social media as well as get involved to help their organisations achieve more. Those that don't are losing out on a number of great opportunities.
David Dzienciol Regional Vice-President and General Manager, Asia-Pacific Parallels Software Pte Ltd
SOCIAL media has forever changed the way that organisations engage with their stakeholders, encouraging ''always-on'' listening and fostering two-way conversations more than ever before. As social media continues to create opportunities for organisations to better connect with stakeholders, they need to evolve to truly become a social business where insights gleaned can be applied to benefit the entire organisation.
Two examples: customer feedback from social networks and forums can be channelled into product development; and corporate social media tools such as Salesforce Chatter, which we use, provides a platform for employees to collaborate more flexibly and transparently with each other. Engaged employees then become our brand evangelists on customer-facing networks such as LinkedIn.
Organisations need to become a truly social business, where data is the organisation's most valuable raw material and information is the most valuable commodity. Winners will be the companies and the innovators that hold information as their focal point.
Steve Leonard President EMC Asia-Pacific/Japan
SOCIAL media is a key contributing cause in the proliferation of unstructured data. Business leaders today are interested in how this explosive data growth can open up new business opportunities, as well as how we can communicate and innovate to better engage our customers, partners and employees.
Complemented with the right analytics technology and appropriately harnessed, social media can serve as an effective internal and external communications tool, as well as help companies be more transparent with their stakeholders. As examples, engineers can access ''how to'' videos on YouTube and sales teams can upload videos of customer references via FaceBook groups. Similarly, partners and industry analysts can be kept abreast, real time, of new product launches via Twitter and targeted LinkedIn groups. No longer is communication a one-way flow, with DiggIt and Twitter allowing customers to share their preferences and feedback for product improvements.
The role of the CEO is to examine what vehicles are available and how they will add value to his or her stakeholders. By using social media to innovate, communicate and collaborate, CEOs can ensure that they increase their chances to win in the crowded marketplace.
Deepali Chaturvedi Head of South-east Asia Reed Specialist Recruitment
AT Reed, maintaining a consistent social media presence is a key feature of the work that our consultants undertake on behalf of clients. LinkedIn, for example, is regularly utilised to source for talent and to review a candidate's peer recommendations and references.
Social media provides companies with new ways to reach customers, interact with partners and locate talent. Social networking is essentially about connecting. It can enhance the standing and reputation of a company with its clients when employees demonstrate their skills online.
A CEO must ensure that social media is used professionally and responsibly, and that specific ground rules are put in place to avoid careless talk and security disasters. A CEO who uses social media to encourage meaningful discussions, express opinions and ideas, share news and celebrate success can improve transparency within the company.
This also sends a positive message that the organisation allows flexibility in communication channels and is not paranoid about employees stating their views and using social networking sites to collaborate.
Karl Chong CEO Groupon
SOCIAL media is an important medium for organisations to communicate with their key stakeholders both externally and internally, as it is not only one of the most rapid forms of communication, but also interactive. Transparency is clearly evident in any communications conducted via this platform, and trust to a company or brand can be quickly built up or easily shattered.
Social media is a vital component to building brand awareness, and provides satisfied customers with an easy tool to endorse and share the brand. Groupon, for example, utilises this ever-growing channel to engage and foster deeper relationships with customers about our daily deals as well as receive feedback on all its deals - including travel, services and Groupon Goods - along with customer service.
Today's CEOs need to take the steps necessary to proactively use social media as an asset in creating a collaborative and open environment for their customers, partners and employees.
Charlie Foo Vice-President for Asia-Pacific Brocade
SOCIAL media is not a fad and is here to stay. As a leader, the CEO should understand and value how online social engagement is transforming customer empowerment and organisational efficiency, and champion building a cross-functional social media organisation to coordinate strategies and deliver results.
Social media is not just about Facebook or Twitter but a real-time business platform to communicate, engage and foster relationships with stakeholders. Companies can also harness social media to raise productivity through forming and sharing online workgroups, cross-pollinate ideas and communicate success stories.
It is therefore paramount to build a business case around it so as to allow the organisation to identify how social media can help achieve overall business goals, determine the best strategic approaches, and assess the financial impact that will be ultimately achieved.
Liu Chunlin CEO K&C Protective Technologies Pte Ltd
IN terms of publicity, communication and presence, social media is as important if not more important than traditional print media in some cases. Companies, especially public-listed ones, already have their own websites and investor relations column. It is thus natural that they slip into the social media area as an extension of this. Embracing social media is thus trend-setting, and communicates confidence and transparency. There is also the hip factor and the quick connection to the younger generation.
However, apart from the communications and presence aspect, one still needs the confidentiality and privacy for an open ''family'' discussion within the company cyber walls. In terms of collaboration, here one would even want to have greater confidentiality. Thus, for example, one does not hear of an Apple product until the day that it is launched, though swirls of rumour will usually be out in cyberspace.
Bob Grove Managing Director, South-east Asia Edelman
GOOD decisions flow from good information, and increasingly, that information resides on the social web. Today's leaders have the opportunity to listen to what employees, customers and stakeholders are saying in real-time; and in response, make smart decisions to stay ahead of the game. Leaders who are digital natives understand this opportunity to mine social data very well, and are driving the adoption of social media across the organisation, for internal and external functions, as an innovative game-changer.
While not all leaders are active participants in this space, it is important for them to provide executive sponsorship, vision and a mandate for the business to be more social.
Hugues Delcourt Country Executive, ABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore and Chief Executive Officer of ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia & Middle East
SOCIAL media has transformed human lives, not only as a personal communications and networking tool, but also as a means for some companies to engage customers, employees and the wider public.
At ABN AMRO Private Banking, we recognise the value that social media could bring to our business and operations. We have invested in and are developing a virtual desktop solution to allow employees to link their personal mobile devices to our bank's systems. In this way, our staff can have the flexibility to access social media platforms via their personal mobile devices, and yet simultaneously use these devices to perform work functions. As the majority of our clients are iPad users, we have also invested and created an innovative investment research application to provide our private clients with the added convenience of accessing our private bank's research materials and investment views on their iPads anytime, anywhere.
These are just some examples of how companies like ours could use social media to engage their stakeholders better, and there is certainly much more that can be done and achieved. All business leaders should therefore take a long-term view of incorporating social media in their overall strategic business and stakeholder engagement roadmap.
Manish Goel CEO TrustSphere
EXACTLY how useful social media will be to the enterprise - both for employees and customers - is still being determined. It is clear that social media is a powerful force that can dramatically benefit - or impact - business. CEOs must recognise social media's potential and rapidly assess how it can engage customers, team members and the broader community - today and longer term.
We will eventually accept social media as we did the Internet, as an essential part of everyday living. CEOs who embrace social media now will reap the benefits longer term and leverage it for a competitive advantage.
Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen Vice-President & General Manager Red Hat Asia-Pacific
RED Hat's mission statement is: ''To be the catalyst in communities of partners and customers and contributors building better technology the open-source way.'' We believe that for innovation to happen, you have to think about it as an ecosystem, and social media plays a key role in enabling this.
In fact, our CEO Jim Whitehurst is a heavy user of our internal social media platform to get direct feedback from employees about company issues. While this might mean that a decision will take some time to be made, you also get a flawless execution because everyone's engaged. Our external social media programme meanwhile has been effective as a feedback channel on how others see us.
David Hope GM & Regional Managing Director Infor Global Solutions, Asia-Pacific South
SOCIAL media today has made communicating with peers easy, allowing them to share information, collect feedback and make decisions. Things are no different in the enterprise space. At Infor, we use social media-like sharing and communication tools to increase creativity and collaboration, with important protections for sensitive business and customer data in a secure environment.
In addition, we help businesses address the challenge of knowledge transfer across different generations within the workforce by encouraging the sharing of information in a way that is intuitive and familiar to both younger and older generations of workers, including millennials.
Ang Swee Meng, Allen Group Managing Director Aldon Technologies Services
THE communications landscape in which enterprises communicate their core values has changed as social media technology evolved. Additionally, enterprises face increasing demand for more transparency and engagement by stakeholders. These interrelated trends mean that companies need to rethink how communication can be effective in this new reality.
Social media is not a fad but will be an integral part of the communications strategy of any sustainable business. Social media is an effective tool in facilitating dialogue with different stakeholders as well as collaboration with customers and partners. The days when only the CEO communicates with stakeholders through one-way channels are gone. Employees who are part of the company's values and culture should be empowered to engage in this conversation, be it business or social matters. For example, company's policy matters, newsletters, suggestion schemes, HR matters and social activities can be communicated via this platform.
In this way, social media enables employees in the company and even partners to communicate as a whole orchestra, with each playing their own notes, under the baton of the CEO who ensures that the resulting symphony is harmonious and clear.
Annie Yap Managing Director AYP Associates Pte Ltd
SOCIAL media definitely enhances many key areas by increasing the quantity and quality of communication. However, some will be enthusiastic about greater transparency but others may feel that their privacy is threatened, especially employees. The right approach needs to be taken to fully reap the benefits of social media.
The CEO may not be spearheading the initiative but he/she should promote and facilitate the healthy use of social media. The CEO also sets the tone of interactions online and ensures consistency of the company's image within the organisation and out.
In AYP, our recruiters use Linkedin to search and understand our targeted candidates' profile. Also, I highly encourage my employees to add me on FaceBook and LinkedIn but the choice is ultimately theirs, and feedback has been positive. Lastly, CEOs must strike a delicate balance between being professional and personal.
If handled appropriately, social media can lead to more engaged employees, customers and an enjoyable company culture.
David Leong Managing Director PeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd
SOCIAL media has evolved to become a form of mainstream communication channel between businesses (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C) and between consumer-to-consumer (C2C) or peer-to-peer. The prowess of the social media network is extensive. Facebook with its 800 million strong and growing constituents can become the world's third largest country by population, after China and India. Unto itself, Facebook with its diversity of races, languages, interest groups and social causes, etc, is a rich ecosystem.
Any businesses or organisations with an outreach motive, whether internal or external, must consider this pervasive and mainstream social media network for engagement.
Since social media in Facebook is premised on a real-name basis, the transparency index is high. Collaboration and innovation is really a function of connectivity and sharing; and on the social network platform, sharing becomes commonplace and can become combustive. A single idea or social cause that can provoke and incite mass participation can either wreak havoc or bring about changes in countries, businesses or even among peers.
Any sensible CEO must have a social media strategy, missing it out will be at the business' own peril.
Joshua Yim CEO Achieve Group
WE have witnessed how powerful social media can be in bringing forth the voices of the people - be they those of a country's citizens or employees of an organisation. For a company, the main role that social media plays is in the external and internal engagement of people. Externally, it can raise awareness of a company's products and services to customers and business partners. Internally, it can be used to engage employees.
However, I personally feel that instead of being a hotbed for innovation, social media is more commonly used as a platform for people to air their grievances about a company's products, service, internal policies and working procedures. Several organisations have already been ''exposed'' and criticised on social media for committing gaffes, so the very nature of social media's open communication platform calls for greater transparency.
The CEO's role is to ensure that enough resources are channelled towards developing this area, which is growing in importance.
Patrick Liew CEO HSR International Realtors Pte Ltd
PROLIFERATION of social media sites and its penetration in the market are causing a tectonic shift in business communication. Companies are compelled to be more proactive, direct, transparent and responsible. They have to be more proactive in using social media to enhance their visibility, reaching out to their target audience, and responding honestly and promptly to the noise in cyberspace so as to prevent a reputational tsunami.
Company executives at all levels, including CEOs, are compelled to engage directly with both internal and external customers. Instead of flaunting the usual marketing fluff, they will have to focus on relevance, appeal and justification of the message.
Collective intelligence of the online crowd dictates that information has to also be customised, palatable and beneficial. As a result of the 24/7 dynamic communication cycles, customers and pro-CSR activists are not going to be satisfied with just having their concerns heard, they expect a swift and positive response on their own terms and in accordance with their time frame.
Dhirendra Shantilal Senior Vice-President, Asia-Pacific Kelly Services
THE widespread use of social media platforms has altered the way that communications take place. While social media has created an additional dimension and a wider reach for companies to communicate with its various stakeholders, the right strategy and framework of engagement, along with proper management, should be in place in order to enhance transparency and promote collaboration and innovation.
Companies should be prepared to engage with the wider audience when embarking on a social media strategy and use it fully to not only raise their own profiles but also use it as a form of check and balance avenue for the organisations to improve. Within the HR and workforce solutions sector, the use of social media improves the way that industry players operate to better serve clients as well as to help jobseekers.
Dora Hoan Group CEO Best World International Ltd
IN this age of technology, the power of going viral has driven social media to such enormous popularity. Besides being the platform for organisations to connect with their consumers and partners, social media has also helped mobilise people and promote knowledge-sharing, which improves the business unit's innovation and collaboration capabilities.
Success with social media is based on commitment. With its growing influence on consumers' buying behaviour, organisations should tap into real-time communication reach to further enhance consumer experience in a bid to boost the company's image in the public's eyes.
Besides being socially versed, CEOs should also make organisational changes to incorporate social media into their business practices. While this effort embraces transparency, employees need to also be made aware of the implications that may result.
David Ang Executive Director Singapore Human Resources Institute
SOCIAL media has become a way of life, not just in personal way. It is transforming how management, businesses and countries are run. Because of the deep and diverse impact that social media can create, the motion of leadership has changed.
There is a demand and spectacular need for an innovative mindset and leadership skills. Conventional leadership approaches have inhibited creativity and innovation, and decreased motivation and productivity in dynamic and complex business environments.
Paradoxically, modern business environments - fuelled by interconnectivity and the technological revolution - are predominantly comprised of knowledge workers, whose creativity and innovation are the main driving force for creating values.
In the context of changing management and leadership approaches, HR and business leaders are cognisant of the impactful role of social media in communication, relationship building and value creation.
Social media can play an important enabling role in this effort. Apart from the standardised processes, the organisations have to enable experimenting with social media tools that will lead to socially enabled values such as collaboration, transparency, trust, openness, freedom and meritocracy which will then strengthen part of the overall organisational culture.
In the context of sustainable performance, social media can play a unique role to support all six key drivers of performance: culture, relationships, individuals, strategy, systems and resources.
Effective communication through social media tools can enhance collaboration, interaction and sharing knowledge and ideas. this will naturally lead to process improvements, breaking down silo mentality, and improving creativity and innovation across the organisation.
Social media platforms can also help to bridge the gaps between the various generations of the workforce.
CEOs and all levels of managers can play a facilitative role that is inspiring, embracing and exemplary.
Lim Soon Hock Managing Director Plan-B ICAG Pte Ltd
WE are now living in a content-rich and Internet-driven world. The Web has revolutionised the rules of doing business. Social media tools now allow organisations to communicate directly with customers. Content drives action. Customers now have immense power to influence others on what they think of companies, their services and their products.
CEOs should not ignore this new phenomenon. Those who do so, run the risks of not fully understanding the needs of the marketplace and that of their customers from the gifts of their instant feedback. They should adapt their businesses and communications strategies, to make the most out of the Web-enabled marketplace of ideas and conversations. In order to achieve this, organisations need to consider creating content that is valuable and that people want to share, making it fun and easy for them, much like many of the apps, that are running on mobile devices such as the iPhone and the iPad.
Online success comes from thinking like a journalist and a thought leader. This means that CEOs will need to make time to post comments and to respond to queries timely. Very often, this involves being transparent with company policies, for the social media strategy to work. Companies can look forward to creating a name for themselves and to building a growing pool of online advocates for their products and services. I tinkle often with apps on my iPhone and iPad. It is clear to me that more CEOs need to be net-savvy, to exploit more of social media to connect with their customers and partners to grow their businesses.
Mike Amour Chief Executive Officer Project: WorldWide Asia-Pacific
AUTHENTICITY and trust are key - social media now provides a vehicle for companies to showcase their innovation, co-create content and engage with its constituents on a level previously not found with traditional platforms. A culture of collaboration and innovation is critical to the success of any firm, and companies that are openly communicating with internal and external stakeholders will naturally cultivate this.
Successful engagement marketing requires that brands stop talking about themselves, and begin to listen to and communicate with their audiences about things that matter to them. If brands engage with audiences in an open dialogue that is an authentic, participatory and valuable experience, this allows audiences to exert more control over their involvement with the brand. These relationships will lead to loyalty, commitment and advocacy, and ultimately profits and growth. At the leadership level, the CEO must help shape the perception and values of the firm among stakeholders. As stakeholders become increasingly savvy in the social space, so must the company and its leaders.

Low Lee Yong CEO & Founder MHC Medical Network
SOCIAL media has revolutionised the way that businesses engage their employees, partners and customers. It is an effective tool for businesses to stay connected, relevant and transparent with them.
However, as a tool for collaboration, its usefulness is still limited. At MHC, our staff are encouraged to share information and the health videos that we produce. We believe in its importance, and reward staff for participating in social media - even during office hours. Although the success may not come quickly, we believe that this is for the long haul.
Ronald Lee Managing Director PrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd
SOCIAL media has the potential to help organisations improve transparency, collaboration and innovation - if the company's social media strategy propounds it. Organisations should view social media as an excellent platform to engage and generate two-way interactions with all its stakeholders - employees, customers and business partners. Besides gaining more market visibility, well-executed social media strategies can also help to enhance employer branding.
Internally, companies can create social media channels for employees' use - to broadcast company announcements and to encourage employees to share ideas in open discussions on topics related to the business or their departments. The latter will help to engender a culture of constant innovation. Rather than restrict social media usage within the workplace, CEOs ought to encourage the development of effective social media strategies and ensure that they are executed well.
Lynne Ng Regional Director Adecco SEA
SOCIAL media provides an excellent way for organisations to demonstrate transparency and openness with their audiences. As social media posts are immediate, questions to the company can be answered in real-time and news can be delivered right when it happens. The use of well-written posts, video, images and useful links can ensure that stories and updates are interesting.
By engaging in social media, CEOs can perform ''temperature checks'' on how their organisations are being talked about in the open domain and the discussions that are trending. They can then demonstrate leadership by participating where they can add value.
Andrea Ross Managing Director (Singapore & Malaysia) Robert Walters Singapore
ORGANISATIONS are now making it a priority to leverage on social media to have an open conversation with their stakeholders and customers. Social media has the ability to bring organisations beyond conventional organisational boundaries to reach out to a wider audience base; using technology to solve problems and drive innovation.
THE use of social media varies for every organisation. Some may feel that social media is the key to connect with stakeholders, while there are definitely others who feel otherwise. Companies can engage employees by crowd-sourcing as employees are more willing to share when hidden behind a veil of anonymity. However, it is useful to note that companies should be prepared to deal with challenges such as the lack of governance and IT involvement when they tap into social media to engage their stakeholders. If this is not dealt with properly, it may impact the success of social media integration.
The CEO plays an important role in promoting the use of social media and taking strategic steps towards implementing technological advancements in the workplace. He or she should help to strategise and make long-term plans to dissolve barriers of entry that the company might have with its target audience, clients or the public. The CEO is also responsible for communicating changes and explaining the reasons behind the change to the rest of the company to ensure a smooth implementation of the new work process.
Michael Jenkins Chief Executive Roffey Park Asia-Pacific
OUR investigations into the impact of Generation Y on the workplace show that they see social media as a vital tool to connect and build community. It is embedded into every aspect of their lives, and as the lines between work and home become blurred, they will expect to remain connected wherever they are in the world. We also know that the organisation needs to earn their engagement; so as CEOs, we need to change our habits or younger generations will see no reason to follow us.
Look at reverse mentoring to develop your own social media skills and make social media easily accessible in your organisation - trusting your employees to use it wisely. Investigate the potential for social media in leadership development, ask Generation Y for their views and use this knowledge to improve the content, shape and delivery of leadership programmes. There is untapped potential in social media that extends beyond using it as a channel for marketing - it will become crucial for engagement and collaboration. Whatever you might think of social media, it is here to stay and we need to embrace it.

Ho Meng KitCEOSingapore Business Federation
IN the next 20 years, businesses would wish for:A young and vigorous work force;An engaged and harmonious workforce;Continued access to foreign workers.
None of these will be assured if we do not succeed in tackling our demographic challenges by dealing with them in a balanced way. It is getting much harder to run a successful business with very stiff competition in markets as well as for resources. Our business environment must be even more conducive in the future as our companies need to be more competitive.
Our population issues must be discussed openly and courageously by all stakeholders. I hope the issues will not be coloured by short-term popular demands but by a desire to seek long-term solutions for the good of Singapore.
John KeungCEOBuilding and Construction Authority
IMPROVED accessibility in the built environment for everyone is increasingly relevant to Singapore's demographic profile as we need to cater to the changing mobility needs of our population. An accessible built environment allows our elderly and the physically disabled to maintain links with their family, friends, and the wider community and have more employment opportunities, enabling them to be independent as we strive for a more inclusive society in Singapore. For BCA, this means pushing for Universal Design (Design for all) in the built environment. I believe this will contribute immensely to the continued growth of our city and a higher quality of life for everyone.
Melvin VuCEOMarina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore
I FEEL that Singapore is facing a negative feedback loop, caused by a lower birth rate, an increasing ageing population, higher immigrant arrival numbers, and lower economic growth, and we need to urgently but carefully break this cycle.
For example, if we were to suddenly stem the numbers of immigrants, it would choke the economy and cause short-term shocks, affecting economic growth and resulting in trade-offs that may not necessarily be better for Singaporeans. Instead, the fundamental issue of infrastructure (both hardware & heartware) should be addressed, focusing on supporting young parents who are raising a child, pro-family policies that would provide a better work-life balance, and resources that would allow the ageing population to contribute meaningfully.
Robert WilkesManaging DirectorTowers Watson Singapore
SINGAPORE needs to continue to strike a balance in relation to the composition of its workforce to drive growth and benefit from it. This can be done by strengthening its focus on increasing the productivity of local talent, while at the same time, being open and welcoming to foreign talent in areas where there is just not enough local supply. This should be complemented by encouraging overseas Singaporeans to return and continue to pursue their careers here.
Also, there is a need to increase the local birth rate by addressing the challenges faced by young parents in balancing the desire to return to work versus the cost of childcare. In this regard, the government's recent announcement about setting up a Ministry of Social and Family Development is a step in the right direction.
In relation to the long-term health and well-being of Singaporeans, the government needs to continue to address citizen ownership of health and well-being and encourage nationwide adoption. Singapore can also look at countries like Korea that are already tackling similar issues.
Lionel LimPresident, Asia-Pacific & JapanCA Technologies
ONE of Singapore's strengths is the country's ability to attract and retain world-class talent. This is the key reason why CA Technologies has chosen Singapore as its regional headquarters for Asia-Pacific & Japan. There are many considerations ahead as Singapore works towards creating a balanced approach to providing opportunities to local talent and attracting talent from around the world. It will truly take a ""Public-Private-People"" partnership to shape an equation that works for all.
What is clear is that for Singapore to continue to be a global business hub, it needs the best minds available in order to thrive as a vibrant and world-class metropolis.
Gerald FooPresidentWalton International Group (S) Pte Ltd
A LOW birth-rate and an increasing ageing population will have an impact on Singapore's economy and also its competitiveness in general. There should be more incentives to encourage couples to have more children instead of stopping at one or two. Companies can also play their part by allowing their female staff to work flexible hours or even from their homes when it is feasible. This will enable them to have work-life balance.
The growing reality for most companies is that we will have to make do with less workers. One way is to allow the staff who have reached retirement age to continue working with no pay cut or disincentives and enjoy the same benefits as before. Companies need to refine their HR policies to take into account the demographic challenges ahead. At Walton, we have introduced flexible working hours for our sales consultants. As long as they meet their own targets, they can plan their own schedules.
Low Lee YongCEO & FounderMHC Medical Network
BUSINESSES will have to cope with a new normal. This includes a silver-haired workforce. As our workforce becomes diverse and more baby-boomers extend their retirement, there will also be cross-cultural and inter-generational issues. For businesses, the costs of employee benefits will increase due to an ageing workforce. It is in the interest for businesses today to make sure that their workforce remains healthy to avert an escalation of costs.
The low TFR (total fertility rate) problem we are facing can be attributed to the high costs of living. I believe more has to be done to provide young parents with access to quality and affordable childcare services. Somehow, market forces might have been distorted from the grants already given. More grant money may have resulted in an escalation of costs as it becomes a vicious cycle. The issue is not so much the amount of grant money given to couples, but rather, are there better ways to provide affordable access to quality childcare services to them? Our population experts may want to take this into consideration.
Hugues DelcourtCountry Executive, ABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore and Chief Executive Officer of ABN AMRO Private BankingAsia & Middle East
SINGAPORE is a unique economy of whose competitiveness and fate are closely tied to its human capital. As the economy matures and moves towards the higher end of the economic value chain, there is greater demand by businesses and companies for professional talent and workers with highly specialised skills and expertise which will be crucial to propel the economy to the next level. At the same time, there is continuing demand for foreign labour to fill the manpower supply-demand gap in the lower value-added segments of the economy, which continue to remain important in supporting the economy's efficiency and effectiveness.
While the inflow of foreign talent and labour is expected to continue at an optimal and balanced rate for the overall benefit of the city state and its citizens, foreign residents like myself look forward to the government's continuing commitment and efforts to bring the different local and foreign communities together to leverage on each others' strengths, as well as to better appreciate Singapore's multi-racial, multi-national, and multi-cultural society. Meritocracy and equality should continue to remain a priority in the country's future roadmap to ensure the continued growth and prosperity of this city state.
Karen FlynnMD & Principal ConsultantEuro RSCG Siren
THE challenges facing Singapore as it continues to mature will be the lack of human capital at all levels for many different roles. Unfortunately, the challenges will permeate culture and cohesiveness - the very fabric of this small and dynamic country. Our culture, including the food flavours we associate with the Lion City, is already changing; immigrants who take up citizenship and bring a wide range of skills to the economy are going to help, but there are issues like increased costs and reduced competitiveness for businesses.
Believe it or not, language is becoming an issue in service-related industries. Singapore has always been known to have English as its business language but lately, staff in hotels, restaurants, even hospital nurses, speak limited English and it frustrates consumers. How do we resolve this?
As the country continues to strive to be the best, all stakeholders will have to work harder together to find a top-down and long-term solution to the myriad of issues - think of this as a sustained engagement strategy for citizens. How do we ensure native Singaporeans are happy with their lives here, balanced with, how do we attract the right newcomers who will share in the continued development and success of this country? Perhaps a simplistic view is a much better filtering system.
Andrea RossManaging Director (Singapore & Malaysia)Robert Walters Singapore
SINGAPORE'S citizen population has reached a dismal point this year as the total fertility rate of 1.2 continues to drop below the replacement rate of 2.1. Demographic challenges such as lower birth rates and longer life expectancies have arisen with a rising number of individuals opting for singlehood, more people delaying marriage, couples having fewer children, coupled with advancements in health care. The growing importance and availability of higher education have also led to a prolonged education period and deferred entry into the workforce, all in all delaying family formation.
Along with the current challenge of a shrinking and ageing population and workforce, lower productivity in the workplace poses yet another challenge for employers. Increasing birth rates remains a key precedent in addressing our demographic challenges. However, more needs to be done to resolve these challenges on top of current policies such as longer maternity leave and more tax incentives for having children. The government can no longer solely bank on foreign talent to make up for the declining workforce; it has to start with changing the mindset of the modern Singaporean. Companies need to actively establish a work-life balance as opposed to merely paying lip service.

A LOT of matured economies like Singapore face the same problem of possible, if not already arrived, stagnation caused by an ageing and shrinking population coupled with the need to create higher value-added jobs. For us, the post-war baby boomers are morphing into the silver cohort. In addition to depriving the economy of workers, the silver generation consumes resources for medical care and retirement needs. Matured economies tinker with demographics by introducing baby incentives, investment visas, and the like. For Singapore not to exploit these is to give away easy advantages in the global competition.
Thus, we cannot give in to the mistaken belief of ""natural"" population changes. We have to continue to make use of policies to encourage working women to have more babies, with the burden of the incentive skewed towards the government instead of the employers, as the latter may be tempted to discriminate against pregnant workers. In the interim, foreign workers and talent is a necessity, which brings with it issues of social integration and the need to beef up the infrastructure to alleviate overcrowding.

SINGAPORE has been battling with the extreme polars of fertility and mortality, putting the population numbers at risk with diminishing birth rates challenging replacement. As the economy matures, an ageing population is inevitable. This phenomenon is made worse when greying takes place in our island state of scarce resources. With a gradually ageing society comes heightened financial and social burdens on the economy. The revenue contribution drops with greying needs and there is a genuine need to keep the numbers in check.
The quickest solution is to import, bearing in mind delicate issues of gainful employment for our people and putting in place adequate infrastructure to support the new growth. Existing measures of raising the retirement age may help in the short term but new births are needed to contain the average age of a society and keeping the matured crowd socially engaged and healthy is crucial to addressing greying needs while balancing the influx of foreign talent to fill the gaps.
Ronald LeeManaging DirectorPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd
WE are already seeing Singapore's demographic challenges materialise in the form of an alarming decline in birth rates. Singaporeans are simply not reproducing enough to replace themselves. Our ageing workforce translates to a declining old-age support ratio that will result in a heavier economic burden on the working-age population, which has already been shrinking. The biggest challenge that many businesses have been complaining about is a lack of the right manpower needed to keep their businesses going - and the economic engine chugging along.
One solution has been to open Singapore's doors to foreigners but that has given rise to various social issues, with the government tightening immigration policies as an anti-foreigner sentiment seemed to pervade society. The problem is very real indeed and the government needs to find the right balance in ensuring sufficient manpower supply to businesses while taking care of the needs of Singaporeans and encouraging social cohesion and integration of the new immigrants.

URBANISATION challenges ranging from migrant inflow to an ageing population have resulted in an urgent need to better manage resources to protect our social capital. Technology can be utilised to enable efficient, sustainable, and intelligent use of tight resources - to enhance liveability for citizens. Analytics can provide insights to guide policymaking, to predict possible areas for social crime, and ensure regulation of labour laws.
Greater engagement among citizenry should be nurtured through effective management of social media. Energy management technologies coupled with sensing technologies can ensure sustainable resource use. A secure cloud infrastructure in place will enable efficient deployment of technologies for both businesses and public services, to bring greater connectivity, visibility, and intelligence into our daily lives.

SINGAPORE is facing the double whammy of an ageing population and low fertility rate, resulting in increased pressure on the working population. Companies can complement government pro-family programmes by introducing flexible working hours. Citrix believes that the workplace of today is transforming from a nine-to-five, office-based environment to an anywhere, any time mobile workstyle.
This means that working professionals, especially mothers, carers of senior citizens or family members with special care needs, will be better able to balance and manage their professional and home responsibilities to achieve work-life balance. Mobile workstyles give them the option of working from anywhere, at any time, on any device, and still be around for their children and family members. They can continue to be productive and effective while at home by leveraging cloud-based services and collaborative solutions such as GoToMeeting, ShareFile, PODIO which allows them to participate in meetings and share work files with colleagues and clients in a secure environment.
Karin ClarkeDirector for Singapore and MalaysiaRandstad Regional
SINGAPORE'S ageing population and ageing workforce are key challenges. The recent Ministry of Manpower figures showed that unemployment dropped back to 2 per cent in Q2 2012, which reflects a very tight labour market and there are no signs this will abate. In the short term, Singapore is in a much better economic situation than many other developed economies. However with its ageing population, over the long term, Singapore will continue to face constrained labour supply, which is key to driving productivity and business growth.
Singaporean citizens and permanent residents make up the majority (four in five) of working professionals, managers, executives, and technicians. The challenge for companies is to continue ""balance building"" a strong local workforce while encouraging foreign talent (both white and blue collar workers) to support economic growth. While the social impact of foreign workers needs to be considered, further tightening of foreign labour quotas could have the unintended consequence of constraining economic growth.
Patrick LiewCEOHSR International Realtors Pte Ltd
FOR a change, we should address the challenge of a greying population from a bottom-up perspective. First, we need to look at how to enable the elderly and the soon-to-be elderly not only to age gracefully but to also commit themselves to a meaningful and productive life. Without their will to live and the spirit to contribute to society, any national policy and programme will amount to nothing.
For example, we need to step up our educational programmes to help them enhance their financial literacy, improve their knowledge of preventive and anti-ageing medicine, and learn the benefits of proven techniques in wellness and positive psychology.
To ensure employment and employability of senior citizens - for both professional and personal pursuits - I suspect we need a change of attitude about the elderly on every level of society. More likely than not, with the increase in lifespan, we will have to help the elderly to work and contribute to their CPF accounts for a longer period of time. In our quest for economic development, I trust we will not do so at the cost of weakening extended family relationships and compromising our responsibility to the ageing population.
Annie YapManaging DirectorAYP Associates Pte Ltd
WITH declining fertility rates and control over the inflow of immigrants, Singapore will face a greater shortage of human resource and talent to drive our economy. While our ultimate goal is to solve the problem by encouraging more births, it will be an extensive and long-term process. As such, we need to emphasise quality over quantity. It may seem counter-intuitive to regulate the inflow of foreigners, but it is a right move to ensure that immigrants can contribute to our economy and society.
Companies will need to manage their talents more proficiently and strategise the full use of their people assets. Most importantly, we must pay careful attention to the younger generations and hone them to be effective leaders of the future. Though we cannot expect substantial growth of our population, we can be certain that our people have the substance to advance our country.
Teng Yeow Heng MichaelManaging DirectorCorporate Turnaround Centre Pte Ltd
IT is heartening to learn that our government has asked for feedback on demographic challenges. Our focus should be to put Singaporean well-being first and even above the well-being of Singapore at times, when dealing with this matter. Failing which, we see the unhealthy divide between Singaporeans and foreign talent, problems of integrating old and new citizens, and subsequently, the breaking apart of our social fabric and harmony which will be detrimental for our very survival.
When we are able to rally the support of the people, the interests of the country such as excellent economic growth and competitiveness can happen. We will be able to collectively face any crises and challenges as a team as in the past since our country's independence.
Joshua YimCEOAchieve Group
JUST as how a company cannot allow itself to shrivel because it cannot find adequate manpower, the country cannot allow its economy to contract due to a shrinking population. If we want to sustain economic growth as a country, we need to have an open immigration policy to make up the shortfall in our population by bringing in capable, well-educated individuals who have the capacity to contribute towards our national objectives. Thus, as a nation, we ought to manage our mindsets with regard to the arrival of new immigrants in our backyards.
Another phenomenon is the increased pace at which Gen Y workers are entering the workforce. These individuals are Internet-savvy, well-connected, and they live and breathe social media. They are more likely to expose the undesirable behaviour of organisations and express their disgruntlement with the government through social media channels online, as we have witnessed of late. Companies are therefore required to ensure even greater transparency in their dealings and ensure that their conduct is always above board.
Dora HoanGroup CEOBest World International Ltd
THE declining TFR (total fertility rate) in Singapore has led to the implementation of foreign immigration policy, which affects the supply of residential and commercial property, as well as the supply of private and public transportation. When the policy implementation does not go concurrently with the increase of property and transportation supply, it causes a rise in living costs. Also, there has been a boom in the construction industry, which was a result of the expansion of F&B and tourism-related businesses.
The actions to control foreign labour employment have reduced the manpower supply for many businesses - especially in the F&B industry - and might cause the close-downs of some of the SMEs. I think that this immigration policy is necessary but it should be a long-term plan and can progress gradually. Foreign labour is critical for businesses and the policy should be relaxed.
Lim Soon HockManaging DirectorPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd
THE reality is that government policies have not been able to achieve sustainable outcomes as shown by the declining total fertility rate, later marriages, and delay in setting up families. Both our men and women want to work. It is imperative therefore, that more be done to support the widely accepted notion of shared parenthood.
The timing is right for a bold move to provide for more paternal leave, which can start with making the current fourth month of maternity leave, gender neutral. As with any revolutionary change, there will be trade-offs and impacts. Businesses will have to adjust to this change, much like what they have achieved with reservist training, for the larger longer term benefit of a growing population and to renew our talent pool.
A Family Charter should also be set up now to mandate all government policies to be scrutinised for their impact on the family, before any policy can be legislated or implemented. This would also compel all ministries to work as a team, to make the family a No 1 priority. All the three key stakeholders must put their money where their mouths are, if they are serious about tackling the two threats. Every Singaporean must play our part to tackle our demographic challenges, and perhaps consider this as our national service, to make Singapore a great place for the family and to raise our children.
Note: Lim Soon Hock is also the chairman of the National Family Council and Centre for Fathering.
David LeongManaging DirectorPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd
ECONOMIC stagnation will accompany a shrinking population and this is only stating the obvious. The less obvious is that Singapore will be sapped of its enterprises' vitality and marketplace buzz if we continue to raise the bar for young foreign talent. Our size is a limiting factor and by itself is a disadvantage and we cannot be constrained by the limits of our shores. Singapore must have porous shores and be a throughput hub with freer flow of goods, services, capital, and people.
Socially, the government has reconstituted its cabinet ministries to sharply focus on integration and assimilation of new citizens and PRs and to build the strength of our communities. The government's renewed focus on societal and community integration is assuring. Infrastructurally, Singapore needs to build capacities in housing, transport, and education to cater to population growth. It is all about economic sensibilities versus Singaporeans' sensitivities and the balancing act will never be easy.

"," THE Singapore economy is now expected to grow 1.5 to 2.5 per cent this year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday. This cuts the top end of the government's earlier 1-3 per cent forecast, while raising its bottom end by half a percentage point.
In his National Day message yesterday evening, Mr Lee said that Singapore is ""doing quite well"" against a backdrop of serious economic problems in Europe and the United States, and China and India slowing down.
The economy grew 1.7 per cent in the first half, he said. Assuming no changes to Q1 GDP, this points to year-on-year growth of 2 per cent in the second quarter, marginally above the flash estimate of 1.9 per cent growth.
But economists had been expecting a stronger upgrade to the Q2 flash estimate, after a surge in biomedical output led to a surprisingly strong manufacturing performance in June.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin thinks services probably stagnated in Q2 to grow less than the flash estimate of one per cent.
This may also imply that the economy did not escape a sequential contraction in Q2 after all, which means the risk of a technical recession remains.
Citi's Kit Wei Zheng estimates that the half-year growth figure translates into a 0.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter contraction in Q2, slightly smaller than the flash estimate of a 1.1 per cent contraction. Full details of Q2 economic performance will be announced by the Ministry of Trade and Industry tomorrow.
In his televised message, Mr Lee touched on how his government is responding to the range of issues Singaporeans face, from housing to public transport, inflation to immigration. But beyond tackling specific issues, Mr Lee now sees the need for Singapore to undertake a broader review of policies, particularly social and education ones.
""To still be a shining red dot twenty years from now, we must rethink our approaches and reinvent ourselves,"" he said. Core principles such as meritocracy, multi-racialism and financial prudence cannot change, but the government should review what needs to change and where bolder action is needed.
Mr Lee has asked Education Minister Heng Swee Keat to lead a committee of younger ministers to ""take a fresh look at what we are doing"".
In a statement yesterday, Mr Heng said the team he forms will engage Singaporeans in a broader, national conversation about themselves. ""What do we want our country, Singapore, to be in 2030? What are our ideals? What principles should underpin our public policies and what values should guide us as a people? What attributes will enable us to attain our ideals?"" Mr Heng said.
Similar questions were asked and answered by Mr Lee himself in yesterday's message. Singapore must offer hope of a better future, be an inclusive society with a heart, and be a home that all Singaporeans love, he said, outlining the themes he is likely to elaborate on in his National Day Rally on Aug 26.

","   What is your vision for a Singapore that the next generation of Singaporeans, and the generation after that, would love and be happy with? What key issues would we need to address in order for this vision to manifest?
Lim Tit Meng Chief ExecutiveScience Centre Singapore WHEN Singapore became independent 47 years ago, much of the international media was sceptical and thought we would never survive because we are just a tiny island lacking in natural resources. But we have become a nation admired by many and our home is a beautiful city-in-the-garden. We even overcame our water supply dependence and others are now using our technologies for water treatment and renewal. Singapore's success is very much linked to the innovative use of science, technology, engineering and math (Stem), creating solutions that not just meet our own domestic needs but also generate jobs and wealth for us in the global knowledge-based economy. Without Stem we could not have built the Gardens by the Bay; we could not have established a strong defence force; we could not have operated the best airport in the world; and we could not have made Pulau Semakau a possibility ... To sustain our global competitiveness and ensure our prosperity and progress, we have to continue nurturing generations of youth who appreciate Stem and apply them creatively. My vision for Singapore is one where scientists and engineers are highly valued and respected, and their contributions to nation building and wealth creation are well rewarded.Hugues DelcourtCountry Executive, ABN Amro Bank NV Singapore; andChief Executive Officer of ABN Amro Private Banking Asia & Middle EastFOR many years to come, I envisage Singapore continuing to be a multi-racial, multi-national and multi-cultural society where people across the world live and interact with each other in a peaceful and harmonious manner. Today, it is already home to more than 1.3 million non-residents coming from various parts of the world.The key challenge would be to develop and maintain a strong social fabric that binds the people together. For foreign residents like myself, I hope to see continuous integration efforts from both the public and private sectors to develop a greater sense of inclusiveness among the community, so that our children can grow up in a healthy environment where there is mutual understanding and respect. One way is to incorporate social values into the education system or workplace culture so that academic excellence and financial success are not the only matters that people value in life. The future generations will have to appreciate that having a network of supportive family and friends will contribute to the overall well-being and sustainability of the society for the long term. Bert WongSenior Managing DirectorFuji Xerox Singapore Pte LtdTHE youths are the key to shaping our future, and it is vital that our next generations are given equal opportunities to be heard and encouraged to cultivate a culture of ""heartware"".Fuji Xerox Singapore's Youth for Orchestrated Growth (YOG) encourages pro-active discourse and interaction between colleagues of different age groups. An internal survey shows that through the numerous initiatives proposed and implemented by a YOG task team comprising Gen Y staff, Youth dialogues and suggestion portals, the Happiness Index of employees has increased by 40 per cent. Such outreach has promoted a fun and passionate environment conducive for the future.Teng Yeow Heng MichaelManaging DirectorCorporate Turnaround Centre Pte LtdTHE vision for Singapore for future generations is still enshrined in our national pledge: To build a democratic society based on justice and equality so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation. In recent years, we have new internal challenges which have affected equality and social harmony such as widening income gap between the rich and the poor, as well as the integration problem between Singaporeans and foreign immigrants. There are external challenges which have affected our prosperity and progress such as weakening economic competitiveness with the ascension of China, India and our neighbouring countries, as well as the depressing global market. We need to address all these key issues or challenges so that we can create a Singapore that we can be happy with and proud of.Dennis YeoManaging Director Colliers International MY VISION is for all Singaporeans to have a less stressful life and equal opportunities created for all school-going children regardless of race and financial ability. Currently, the cost of living and children's education are two most stressful issues for an average Singaporean. At present, the well-to-do are the ones who can afford private enrichment classes and tuition for their children but this is not the case for the less well-to-do families. Thus a division is created between those who ""have"" and those who ""have not"". Our structured school education and programme - including the student-teacher ratio - has not changed for the last 40-plus years. Hence, the consistent improvement in overall standard is not a credit to our education system but a result of created competition, which led to the ""must excel"" mindset of parents and the education environment. Education is expensive in Singapore, if you consider the 40-student per class system, and the cost of private tuition fees which could run up to $1,000 a month for a child. Educating our young is investing in Singapore's future and the government should create a level playing field for all Singapore families. The boom of the private tuition sector is a very telling sign that there is a fault in our current education system.Wong Heng ChewPresidentFujitsu SingaporeTHE embedment of technology in our everyday lives has resulted in information being gathered from and fed to us on a regular basis, which is generating a huge volume of data. There is a need for Singapore to better leverage upon the latest advances in technology to translate this data into knowledge on how our society is evolving and how the ecosystem is being affected. My vision for Singapore and her future generations is to see better harmony and marriage between the physical and digital landscapes to deliver benefits to the society. For this to happen, the nation has to collectively orchestrate the wisdom garnered from the data at scale. The intelligence can then help drive beneficial changes which contribute to the sustainability of Singapore, with some examples being establishing a centralised healthcare system, better addressing regulators and improving customer services for the financial services industry, monitoring Singaporeans' travel patterns to meet transportation demands, reviewing energy consumption to improve energy efficiency, and using analytics in schools to understand students' approach to learning.Joshua YimCEOAchieve Group I ENVISION a Singapore comprising people who have good values and virtues, as I would like our society to have a strong caring spirit and a lot more heart. I would also want to see future Singaporeans having the right attitude; the willingness to be committed and work hard to maintain our competitive edge; having that persevering spirit like that of forefathers, and the desire to grow and improve themselves - instead of being complacent. In an affluent society like ours, many of our young today are born with a silver spoon and it is thus all the more important to inculcate in them the right values and attitude towards people and society. Otherwise, we risk eroding what the previous generations have achieved for this nation. To realise this vision, we need to start with our young - a paradigm shift may be required within our education system to include a greater emphasis on moral and civic education, in addition to academic qualifications and achievements. I encourage the schools and non-profit organisations to organise more programmes for our youth to visit Third World countries. By doing volunteer work in such disadvantaged locations, they will experience first-hand poverty and disaster-stricken areas and realise how extremely fortunate we are to live in such an affluent society. I wish the same for our general population as I believe many of us are very sheltered. Greater public education through various media will be needed to help raise our awareness of what is really happening around the world - and enable us to cherish what we do have.Lionel LimPresident, Asia Pacific & JapanCA TechnologiesSINGAPORE is at a juncture where there have been lively debates on where the country should be heading and how economic growth can be balanced with societal growth. Equality and access to opportunity, continued economic success, whilst maintaining a cohesive and inclusive society, are key visions to strive towards. Singapore should continue to ensure that quality education is accessible and affordable to everyone, with a focus on technology and innovation to keep Singapore's competitive edge for future generations. At CA Technologies, our culture is deeply rooted in making the most of everyone's talent and potential. We should provide an environment where everyone's talent and ability, regardless of financial or social background, can be nurtured. This philosophy drives what we do in the communities where we do business, from philanthropic efforts to sustainability and social programmes. Dhirendra ShantilalSenior Vice-President - Asia PacificKelly Services SINGAPORE has come a long way, and given the current volatile macro-environment, we are definitely at the crossroads. My personal vision is for Singapore to grow into a nation that is caring, inclusive and resilient. We should never discard our core values like meritocracy, multi-racialism and financial prudence but strive to uphold them all the more, as they are the very foundations on which we have grown. Our future generations of Singaporeans are definitely keen to feel a strong sense of belonging to Singapore, as well as to see it as a place where they can turn their aspirations into reality. The key to forging a sense of belonging within the new generation of Singaporeans is in engaging them earnestly and with transparency. I also applaud our leaders for taking the initiative to review current policies and practices to create a better Singapore. However, we have to be creative with the way we communicate and engage. Promoting healthy engagement with in-depth discussions that will lead to forging wide consensus is key in leading us to achieving this vision.R DhinakaranManaging DirectorJay Gee Enterprises Pte LtdAS WE re-dedicate ourselves to the task of nation-building on National Day, we are also at the crossroads in history where we are needed to make bold decisions for our future. These may include taking certain directions and approaches different from what we are used to in our history so far. The challenge is more to address emotional attachments than arriving at a rational decision. Our challenge will be to remain an economic force to attract investments and business, our challenge will be to maintain and improve quality of life holistically in Singapore, our challenge will be to remain a home rather than a house for Singaporeans of all economic backgrounds, and remain cosmopolitan, multiracial, multi-ethnic, embracing perhaps even a wider range of ethnicity, and move ahead stronger. While we have shown considerable proficiency in planning and achieving economic goals, our critical test is to show the same strength in addressing social objectives. A sustainable population will be the first goal while emphasising on a strong culture and values which are key and silent attributes towards social obligations of every human being besides furthering economic interests and career. This will form the pedestal for the next wave of growth for Singapore and achieving a sustainable and more equitable society for the next generation and beyond. My yearning will be for a Singapore which is a perfect blend of the East with the West in terms of culture, values and scientific progress alike - a modern economic force with strong cultural moorings to give a human face to development over the next two decades.Ang Swee Meng, AllenGroup Managing DirectorAldon Technologies Services Pte LtdIN ADDITION to the three values articulated by the Prime Minister - hope, inclusiveness and love - I suggest that ""contribution"" and ""sharing"" should be included as the core values forming the bedrock of our vision for a Singapore that our posterity would love to inherit.Any vision of Singapore must be founded on these core values which provide a firm foundation for a just, equitable and peaceful society where people are accorded their inalienable rights to pursue their happiness within the law. Hope is an essential element of human happiness. It spurs the human spirit with a belief that there will always be a better future in the face of uncertainty and trials. However, people from all walks of life will only dare to hope if they are free to chase their dreams, unconstrained by their background, station in life, fear of failure or prejudices. Ultimately, the hopes of people can be realised only in a society which respects the dignity of every citizen who is given equal opportunity and right to realise their aspirations and live their lives according to their own conscience.To realise our vision, it is imperative for society to establish for the protection of these core values, institutions that can transcend governments, ideologies and political mores. In addition to institutional safeguards, these values must also be imprinted into the social fabric of our society and burned into our collective moral consciousness. This can be achieved by inculcating a national culture of contributing and sharing, actions by which people can manifest love, empathy and compassion for a kinder and more gracious society.Andrea RossManaging Director (Singapore & Malaysia)Robert Walters SingaporeMY VISION for Singapore is an inclusive, progressive generation, where its people are always on the move forward and are able to live together harmoniously. With an increasingly diverse population, there is a pressing need for policies to be designed to accommodate most people's needs. Being in the field of recruitment, I understand the importance of achieving a dynamic and productive workforce - something important for businesses across all industries. To achieve this vision, it requires a change of mindset; for people to be forward-thinking and open to new ideas. The government, organisations and its people should work in tandem. In designing a policy, the government should ideally respond to its people's needs and organisations can provide feedback for what they hope to be included in future policies in order to facilitate the process.David LowCEOFuturistic Store Fixtures Pte LtdA VISION that keeps generation after generation happy is an exciting notion especially when definition of ""happy"" is subjective and changes over time as society progresses. With such in mind, I wish for Singapore to continually be the ideal place to build a home. For this to happen, I envisage happiness to exist when there is a tripartite relationship uniting opportunities, inclusiveness and graciousness in one place. Opportunities: Equal opportunities to be created and made available for our people, where the gifted are presented with arena to excel and influence greater creations. Inclusiveness: This has two branches; one, to ensure the less fortunate communities are being taken care of and feel engaged as one society; the other, to inculcate in our people a spirit of mindfulness and acceptance of immigrants who are here to possibly present the country with new opportunities in economic growth. A cosmopolitan city requires understanding and respect of each diverse culture, religion and race, and embracing this integrated living has to start from young. Graciousness: Give unto society what the society has first presented one with. To give thanks for one's social arrival and contribute to society where the less privileged could receive and likewise give thanks. This closely ties in with inclusiveness and reinforces harmony in this uniquely Singapore formation.Janet AngManaging DirectorIBM SingaporeWHEN I shared these questions with some of the Gen Ys in IBM Singapore, I was heartened that they voiced a common vision for Singapore - one that is sustainable, economically strong, and retains the history and values that made us the nation that we are today. These are not very much different from what my generation, and those before mine, wanted for our families and us. It was encouraging and heartwarming to also know that they - Gen Y - not unlike us, all want to play an active role in the decisions that affect Singapore. They grew up on a staple diet of the latest technologies and are contributors to the social media explosion. They are also aware that they exist in a landscape where their workplace and playground are becoming ""borderless"". It is all the more important then that the nation continues to innovate, including having the government leverage the innovations that technology allows for better collaboration, transparency and citizen engagement - so that Singaporeans continue to enjoy the fruits that generations ahead of us have laboured for.Patrick Liew CEOHSR International Realtors Pte LtdAS WE build on the infrastructure of Singapore, we need to also focus on its ""software"", the people aspects of society. We need to focus on helping Singaporeans develop a deeper sense of belonging, rootedness, and affection for our nation. They should take stronger ownership of and be passionate about building a country that they can be proud of, one that will be admired by other people, far and wide. A place where they can find meaning, happiness and fulfilment on an individual, family and community level. There should be stronger community support systems to help citizens engage and collaborate with one another in healthy and worthwhile programmes so as to improve overall quality of life. We need to preserve the soul of our nation, constantly improving our assistance to the last, the least, and the lost, and helping them achieve self-reliance and live a dignified lifestyle. We need to bring about more love, compassion and kindness to a wider community and for people of different culture, custom and creed. There must be a greater sense that we can look forward to the future with hope and optimism, a future that will be a treasure cove of beautiful memories for our children and children's children.David Leong Managing DirectorPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte LtdPLATEAUING and tepid economic growth, diminishing and ageing population are issues Singapore has to deal with from the present to the future. The landscape where there are more aged than the young, where Singapore has a current account deficit in terms of population is really dire. Singapore should be positioned as an epicentre in Asia with porous shores where talent is attracted and gravitates towards our vibrant financial and social sectors, where fashion and the arts converge and where youths in Asia come to study and work.Singapore can least afford to keep our flood-gates closed and doors shut to talents as we need to have a strong composite of different talents to keep our economy humming. The balance of brain and brawn in our foreign intake is an extremely delicate and sensitive issue since it is economic sensibilities against citizenry sensitivities.Singapore has to embrace racial diversity even more and work at building a more integrated society with stronger social fabric - a fabric that has higher tolerance and will not tear at the seams but will stretch to accommodate the tension. Singapore has to remain porous and not develop a xenophobic or claustrophobic reaction to foreigners. I envisage a Singapore to be the epicentre of finance, education, high fashions and the arts where Asians will converge towards and make it their second home. I envisage a Singapore where talents of the world come here and be a part of us producing for us demographic dividends and not a population current account deficit.I envisage Singapore to be the oasis where the best gather and where the best can emerge.Lim Soon Hock Managing DirectorPlan-B Icag Pte LtdA SINGAPORE that future generations would be happy with, is one in which family is at the core. A society that values the family will not only address concerns over low fertility and population continuity, it will also motivate hard work, lend stability to individuals and root Singaporeans to the country. In laying the foundation for individual well-being, a healthy and resilient family is the springboard, from which an individual becomes economically productive and socially engaged. Singapore would do well to nurture a congenial environment that promotes and supports family life. This is key to our long-term survival and economic and social sustainability. It is my hope that having a healthy, happy and resilient family would one day be at the forefront of every Singaporean's definition of success. But a mindset change across all of society must take place before this vision can be realised. We need to inculcate a Family First mindset in all policies, programmes, and institutions like the workplace and schools. The National Family Council has promoted the Family First message since our inception, and remains committed to cultivating this mindset. We will continue to reach out to key stakeholders - be it through helping young people view marriage and having children as important milestones in life; encouraging businesses to adopt family-friendly policies and practices; or providing feedback to the government on family policies, programmes and services. It is crucial for every Singaporean to play their part in realising this vision.Various players in the public, private and people sectors must work together to build a Singapore that is a great place for our family to flourish and for our children to be raised. Note: Lim Soon Hock is also Chairman of the National Family CouncilDora Hoan Group CEOBest World International LtdIN A few decades, Singapore will be the next New York City - a metropolitan and commercialised city yet with a good lifestyle. We live in a fast-paced culture and with that, we envision the next generation having access to the more advanced technology in the future, which will build a society dominated with knowledgeable and strongly-opinionated people. However, the younger generation will be more engrossed with their own technological devices and become introverted as a result. In order to attain hope, inclusiveness and love in our society, we should start with education by emphasising more on moral education in schools and encouraging the young ones to be more involved in their social life and community activities.Yaj Malik Area Vice-President, AseanCitrix Systems SINCE gaining independence 47 years ago, Singapore has grown into a strong economy with capable citizens contributing to the nation's growth. However, according to a recent Regus survey, 25 per cent of Singaporeans are dissatisfied with the current work-life balance they have. While economic prosperity is essential, a future where Singaporeans can enjoy work-life balance and family bonding is crucial in ensuring the happiness of our citizens. Employers need to shake off the traditional idea that work should be tied to a physical office space or standard time. They should instead look at adopting mobile workstyles that will allow employees to work from anywhere, anytime, giving them the flexibility to manage time spent with loved ones while increasing productivity ""at work"". Employers can consider meeting the expectations of an increasingly technology-savvy generation by proactively adopting a Bring-Your-Own-Device policy. This will enable employees to use their favourite gadgets for both work and play, increasing productivity. Employers need to recognise that work-life balance and device flexibility are values that contribute to the overall well-being and happiness of today's employees. This idea of improving work-life balance is something both employers and employees in Singapore can jointly work towards.Ronald Lee Managing DirectorPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd SINGAPORE is what she is today because of deliberate design. We have excelled in almost every aspect because we worked hard for it. We became an economic success due to our ""kiasu"" (scared to lose) mentality. A uniquely Singaporean culture has been established, which many are stuck with - study hard, get a good job, earn lots of money quickly, buy a house, a car and what have you. We have become slaves to these pursuits. There is nothing wrong in going after success and prosperity, but idolising them is. When we are so focused on making money, we inevitably sacrifice social and family values. We have less time for our friends and families as we prioritse work and business to generate more income. I am sure that it is not everyone's desire to have a life that revolves almost entirely around work and making money to upkeep our lifestyles. But competitiveness and covetousness have led us to this current state. My vision for the next generations of Singaporeans is that they get to enjoy a more balanced, happy and healthy lifestyle. How? We need to start to ""unwind"" gradually. Our leaders, who have generally set the tone and pace all these years, must recognise and accept that change is necessary and be willing to take the lead to make this possible. Policies must be made to encourage changes to achieve that elusive ""balance"".Eric Hoh Vice-President, Asia South RegionSymantecMY VISION is a Singapore that achieves its aspirations to be a global hub, one that is technologically advanced and fully connected between the government, its citizens and the private sector. Singapore has much to gain in this highly connected and fast-evolving cyber world, especially for innovative and sunrise industries. We need to have the infrastructure, the security and peace of mind, and talent that will attract businesses and investments to our shores. From Symantec's perspective, with Singapore being a connected society and a regional hub, I hope to see Singapore become a leading light in R&D on cyber security. Through our recent investment into the Security Response Center in Singapore, we aim to cultivate strong public-private partnerships with research and tertiary institutions, bring in advanced technological skills, and share insights from our research with the rest of the world. With the forward-looking policies that the government has placed and its support of initiatives such as ours, I'm confident we're truly on our way to become the regional business hub and a first-class connected nation that Singaporeans can be proud of.Liu ChunlinCEO K&C Protective Technologies Pte Ltd IN AN age of social media and Internet connectivity, the expectation of a new generation which has not gone through the hardship of World War II will be vastly different. Certainly, reminding the new generation of the adversity the older generation has overcome is by now a stale argument. We need to move on and seize a captivating vision for all, one that responds to the real challenges of the current world, without necessarily holding too tightly to the past. Certainly the new generation expects an enriching enjoyable life, and may see the older generation as working too hard for their living.The new generation will certainly look beyond the confines of conventionality when it comes to jobs. Work that may take them round the work, work that may be creative and artistic, ground breaking, perhaps in the Internet sphere, will be cool. After all, the Internet company millionaires may be their new heroes. I hope the new generation will not be too materialistic or hedonistic. That there will be beautiful soul still, so that work will not be the be-all and end-all. Certainly I hope to see a more inclusive society, since globalisation and an open society should inure all to the various cultural and societal differences. As MNCs become disillusioned by the problems of outsourcing work and production to countries with cheap labour with either natural hazard problems, social upheaval problems, security issues or even plain language and cultural miscommunication, I hope that Singapore can see more higher-value jobs migrating here. We can present a ""packaged deal"" of skilled, sustainable and cost-effective labour within the geographical confines of our country which the world's companies will look for in us, and not cast their eyes on the cheap mass labour in the BRIC countries. I also hope to see a sustainable future, that our vulnerability will continue to be protected by our efforts and determination in making us a strong nation.

","   Are the recently announced changes sufficient to achieve the transformation of Singapore's education system or does more need to be done? How can businesses and families contribute to this transformation?
Pollie Sim Chief Executive Officer Maybank Singapore
IT is certainly right that we move away from emphasising academic excellence to the exclusion of everything else. Recognition schemes that are biased in this respect should be done away with. As an organisation, we have always looked beyond just academic success. Hence, the Ministry of Education's (MOE) recent changes are a good start.
To transform our education system, we need to be clear about the purpose of education. In the current Singaporean context, beyond basic literacy and character-building, we need to foster a spirit of exploration. We need to transform knowledge into wisdom, and channel competitive urges into innovation, creativity, thought leadership, and entrepreneurship. These must be balanced with a firm foundation in ethics, tempered with compassion, deep thinking, strength of character, and an appreciation for the humanities. All of these are essential for excellence and global success in any field of study or profession, whether practical or lofty, and should be cultivated from young.
Outside of the education system, businesses are already shifting towards preferring job candidates who demonstrate other kinds of intelligence beyond the academic. By way of analogy, people now also judge businesses beyond their balance sheets - all things being equal, they tend towards values-based organisations with more global thinking. Over time, when it becomes clear that these qualities are valued in business and society, families will naturally also encourage the development of such qualities, and nurture their children in a more holistic manner.
I look forward to seeing how our education system will be further tweaked to support these changing attitudes, so that future generations of Singaporeans will continue to help Singapore progress and remain relevant on the global stage.
Tan Choon Seng Group CEO WBL Corporation (Wearnes)
MANY Singapore-bred business leaders have benefited from the country's system of meritocracy and have risen through the ranks, regardless of their alma mater. In our selection of new employees, our preference is always for those who project a good work attitude and are a good fit to our corporate values. A candidate's previous work experience and academic achievements can only provide insights into his/her potential to contribute to the company.
A shift in focus to a more rounded education system would put our youths in better stead to compete for jobs in an increasingly globalised economy.
Madhu Verma Founder SoCh in Action
DOING away with the Secondary School Banding System is a positive step towards ensuring that the Singapore education system stays competitive and relevant. The future realities and challenges that our children will face will be very different from ours today. Skills in maths, science, and languages are important but these alone would not guarantee success for the next generation. Creativity and character are as essential. Unless the academic pressure moves away from strictly favouring grades and exams, there is very little room for these to shine and be nurtured.
Through our work with children, we have had the privilege of seeing nine- to 14-year-olds rising to the challenge of addressing real community problems. We have witnessed that when children are encouraged to think, express their thoughts freely, and act by choice, they can bring fresh perspectives and solutions to problems that we adults tend to overlook or undervalue. Well-designed activities like service learning and creative arts support better learning, and they should be woven into the fabric of our children's education, either through policy changes to improve the current system or through collaborative programmes by the private sector and social enterprises.
Parents, too, play a key role and should be regularly consulted as changes are being defined and implemented. We all have a stake in the future of our children, and by inspiring them to be the change they would like to see in the world, we will see them succeed and achieve their true potential.
Deb Loveridge Managing Director Randstad
RECENT changes to the education system, such as plans for a 'Student-Centric, Values-Driven Education', are an important step in Singapore's continuous effort to ensure a high-quality and high-class education system.
To support these changes, business leaders and families also need to change the mindset that certain academic qualifications guarantee better-paying jobs. If our business community does not embrace this change, we run the risk of having a group of graduates with impressive paper qualifications but who may lack 'softer' qualities such as creativity and initiative. It will be the ones with well-rounded talent who will help fuel Singapore's business growth aspirations.
Thirumalai Chandroo Chairman/CEO Modern Montessori International Group
WHILE Singapore is determined to transform its educative system and focus on delivering a more rounded education, there is still a need for alteration in the mindset of parents and teachers to look beyond just examination and grades.
To support education change that transcends school improvements, quality teaching and increased openness to knowledge, the development of student aptitude and creative potential should be enhanced. Both parents and teachers should create an environment enabling a strong foundation in the development of independent thinking, grace and courteousness in social skills and free exploration of the environment. The aim should be to encourage students in building and developing their abilities, fostering confidence and care for the community in order to cope with the ever-evolving education modes in the 21st century.
Scott Burnett Managing Director-South East Asia Towers Watson
A STRONG focus on academic excellence is an issue common to any society which prizes achievements. However, a well-rounded education is not just about academic achievements and ranking. A holistic education system should encourage sharing of new ideas and healthy debate. It should inculcate thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as spur creativity and innovation in the future workforce of Singapore.
High levels of numeracy coupled with diverse vocational courses help to develop a wide portfolio of practical skills to suit the needs of the industry. For Singapore to maintain and increase its standard of living for its next generation, it would need to continue to add more value to the goods and services it produces compared to its peers. Singapore should continue to improve its world-class educational system by moving the needle on its vocational standards, strengthening the teaching profession and its overall approach by ensuring that all students, local or foreign, have easier access to greater choices of education which are suited to their interests, needs and talents.
Julian Quinn Vice President, Asia Pacific Adobe Systems Incorporated
I GREW up in Singapore and went to primary school here. The changes we've seen in the always-advancing national education system are just phenomenal and have helped make Singapore the envy of the region in this respect. The recently-announced changes are evident that the government's direction for education is evolving to meet the needs of both students and the industry.
With the wide array of gadgets in everyday use now and the increased reliance on technology, employers are looking for more than just academic success. There is now a great emphasis placed on how adept students are in the '3Cs' - 'Creativity', 'Communication' and 'Collaboration'. However, not only do we need to instil this with students, but we also need to ensure that our educators are well-equipped as they play a vital role in moulding our students.
Businesses can definitely do more to contribute to this. Here at Adobe, we work very closely with leading education institutions in Singapore and across the region by providing the tools to develop the critical digital communication and creativity skills needed in today's workforce. We also provide standards-aligned curriculum, professional development and industry-recognised certification, helping schools of all sizes ensure that their students are set up for success when they enter the business world. I'm inspired every time I visit one of our school customers to see the amazing ways in which students and teachers use our technology to work collaboratively, communicate their ideas, and create fresh and wonderful new things.
Patrick Liew CEO HSR Global Ltd
AS a company that houses Junior Achievement, a world-renowned charity organisation that trains young people in life skills, we believe that educating the young cannot be relegated purely to parents and teachers. We in the private sector can and should play our part in helping them to inculcate values of a responsible citizen and member of society.
We can help the teachers and complement the curriculum by training the young in work-readiness, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and other skills so as to to help them capitalise on opportunities in the 21st century. We can bring to them real-world experience and wisdom through a variety of projects and programmes. As volunteers, we can organise practical and hands-on workshops as a part of classroom lessons or co-curricular activities. We can also arrange internships and job-shadow programmes to help the young understand the realities of the working world.
In addition, we can conduct leadership and business training, projects and competitions to enhance their knowledge, skills and behaviour. To help them expand their potential and develop their competence, we can also work with them to co-create new concepts, ideas and solutions.
We believe that the young have tremendous potential for creativity, innovation and action. When the private sector works closely with the schools, we can help to unleash and channel their energy for the good of the community and groom them to become better leaders in the future.
Patrick Liew is also the Chairman for Junior Achievement (Singapore).
Ronald Lee Managing Director PrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd
WHILE Singapore's education system has been lauded by some global education experts for its high standards, it has certainly encountered its fair share of criticism too. These changes are a good starting point as there has been a glitch in the system for far too long - a great imbalance that focused too much on academic achievement. Abolishing the academic banding will go some way towards creating a more balanced system.
However, what is of greater importance is ensuring that the curriculum incorporates a greater emphasis on character-building to create truly well-rounded individuals. There also needs to be a paradigm shift within the family support system; away from piling on tuition and supplementary classes to more activities that help build character and values, such as doing volunteer and charity work together as a family.
Businesses can contribute to this transformation by skewing their hiring policies towards a stronger emphasis on recruiting individuals with a more well-rounded background, such as fresh graduates who excelled in co-curricular activities as well as candidates who complement their professional accomplishments with volunteer work.
Annie Yap Managing Director AYP Associates Pte Ltd
REMOVING the banding system is a good start in sending out the message that a student should be valued for more than his grades. However, even without the band, the 'brand' of a school is still ingrained in many of our minds. More needs to be done to facilitate this transformation - for instance, actively marketing the unique strengths of schools in the lower bands.
Families need to inculcate appropriate expectations in their children and provide guidance suited to each child's needs. Indirectly, businesses play a crucial part as well. The clamour for top grades and schools is to ultimately ensure employability. Businesses can contribute greatly by fostering a recruitment climate where other qualities, such as leadership capabilities and life skills, are emphasised alongside academic achievement.
Eric Hoh Vice President, Asia South Region Symantec
APART from the promise of a well-rounded education, the Singapore government has demonstrated its commitment to provide students with equal opportunity to realise their potential during their formative years. As knowledge-based industries become Singapore's main source of growth, the education system needs to also focus on equipping students with the relevant skill sets required by those industries. This can be achieved through internships where students have much to gain by being involved in on-the-job training.
As Singapore's connectivity grows, so has our reliance on robust IT infrastructure. The demand for talent in emerging areas such as cyber security and mobility is expected to grow exponentially. The future calls for the brightest of talents and it all starts with education. Supporting Singapore's vision to transform its education system, Symantec has been partnering with institutes of higher learning to engage their students in our internship programmes. During the course of the programme, students are exposed to Symantec's various business functions including technology sales, marketing, systems engineering and security response to name a few, all aimed at empowering students to think as IT professionals. Similar initiatives will equip students with the relevant qualifications to support the IT industry and the economy.
Mark Billington Regional Director South East Asia ICAEW
THE recent changes to encourage students to develop other interests and be more well-rounded, instead of simply focusing on academic results, is a step in the right direction. We strongly believe that the path to success lies not just in having good grades but being holistic individuals able to navigate an increasingly complex and globalised world. Over the past 130 years, we have found that excellence in academic skills must be supported by an understanding in how knowledge and technical skills can be applied to real-life situations and in business. This must be coupled with necessary soft skills such as listening and communication skills, analytical thinking, time management, diplomacy and the ability to negotiate and influence decisions.
Finally, a strong foundation in ethics is also important to ensure our future generations are able to think and behave in ways that benefit the community.
Dhirendra Shantilal Senior Vice President-Asia Pacific Kelly Services
THE recently announced changes to the education system will definitely benefit Singapore in the long term. A true transformation will come about when the changes are executed and implemented well, and when businesses make the same paradigm shift in the way they hire and retain talent. When businesses shift their talent and workforce management strategies towards focusing on aspects other than academic achievements, this will likely create a real impact on the changes to the education system.
As a global workforce solutions provider with a long operating history in Singapore, we applaud the proposed changes and are confident that these bold steps will have a positive impact on the future generations of Singapore. This will lead to us being able to produce a fine workforce that is resilient, resourceful and highly adaptable to the fast-changing trends of the global economy.
It is not just up to businesses and families to support these changes; every member of Singapore society should be encouraged to do so.
Dora Hoan Group CEO Best World International Ltd
THE education system all along focuses too much on exam grades, which has given both parents and students tremendous pressure. The changes will slightly lighten the students' burden from the school but we need to also tackle a current issue which is the problem with our youths, who are too engrossed in their gadgets that they have lost touch with the outside world. The moral education syllabus should be reformed to nurture the good character in students to be responsible citizens who contribute to society. They should be taught to embrace Western technology but still stay true to our own Oriental values.
Given how times have changed, parents should be more attentive to the well-being of their children and supportive in developing their social skills and civic values instead of being too pushy when it comes to academic performances.
Hugues Delcourt Country Executive, ABN AMRO Bank N V Singapore and Chief Executive Officer of ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia and Middle East
AS a parent with hopes and aspirations like any parent would for their children to excel, and being possibly conditioned by the French educational system that I experienced, I am inclined to favour an education aiming at a high level of academic excellence. Imparting good social values and behaviour, character-building etc, all start at home and these are experiences that we cannot expect any educator or system to impart to our children.
Having said that, a good early education should not only focus on fact regurgitating and rote learning at a tender age all in aid of passing exams or for streaming purposes. Additionally, not every child is able to pursue academic excellence, but everyone of them can excel in an area or another. One just needs to identify that particular field. A mindset change is needed for parents to accept and support a broader education for their children that encourages creativity and supports excellence in different and diverse fields which is necessary for the future of Singapore.
Certainly from a business perspective, organisations are always on the lookout for bright, young sparks with outgoing personalities, good character and interpersonal skills coupled with excellent academic grades. Businesses can do more by looking beyond academic achievements within a broader talent search criteria and framework and even supporting internship programmes to support and further develop the talents of young graduates who demonstrate non-academic excellence.
Joshua Yim CEO Achieve Group
IN my role as a corporate business leader and human resource development specialist, I help companies find people to join their workforce. I look at the quality of the candidates and I've come across so many instances of people without the right values; some lie, others lack commitment, the list goes on. Although it is not wrong to focus on academic achievements, it is imperative that our education system moves towards a more holistic approach so as to inculcate stronger values in our younger generation.
My question is, to what extent will the recently announced changes mould students in this direction, and instill in them virtues like having a steadfast spirit and respect for others? Ultimately, organisations are at the receiving end of these products of our education system. So I believe that there should be constant dialogue between corporate leaders and the various educational institutions. These dialogue sessions should discuss not just the skill sets we require but also other aspects such as the sort of people we want in our organisations, and the problems and issues we see in the young people joining the general workforce.
An organisation is as strong as its people - so, if its employees have a strong sense of values, then the organisation is likely to conduct itself in a principled manner and be good corporate citizens as well.
Zaheer Merchant Regional Director (Singapore and Europe) QI Group of Companies
IT'S a leap requiring more change. Students exit our education system valuing academia vide 'grades-only', not new skills needed in work. We're not unique. The UK has moved to the EBacc (English Baccalaureate) system, aimed at ensuring that youngsters don't leave school with certificates but no 'real knowledge'. Content will be re-learnt or un-learnt in time. It's the inevitable vicissitudes of a new world workplace.
A consultative education process between ministry and business to understand and then develop innovative and critical thinking will contribute deeply to the education system. The world is wired and research-based. Surrounded by family to provide resources to nurture them, students can then develop into thought leaders and innovators of the millennial generation with no fear of failure.
'Failure is success if we learn from it.' - Malcolm Forbes
Toby Koh Group Managing Director Ademco Security Group
KUDOS to Education Minister Heng Swee Keat for the bold moves to reshape the education scene. It is about time we realise and accept the fact that good academic grades does not mean strong character, resilient will, effective communication skills, social consciousness etc.
Here is what I would like to see from the ministry:Taking a page from the Khan Academy which provides free online video lessons, the Ministry of Education (MOE) should do the same but on a bigger and more in-depth manner. Get the most effective teachers to record videos on each and every subject and put them online so that all Singapore students can access learning material and classes without restriction. Learning at an accelerated pace or slower pace would then be possible tailored for each child. If Mr Khan can do it as an individual effort, imagine what MOE would be able to achieve. Students who require repeat lessons can simply click the play button again.Exploit more technology to make lessons interesting for students. The ability of a teacher to capture the interest of students and cultivate lifelong learning habits varies drastically from individual teacher to another. Every lesson must be filled with multimedia effects to stir and more importantly maintain the attention and interest of the student. Visuals and sound effects coupled with a teacher's personal touch would go much further to make learning an enjoyable experience.Social service in Singapore and in one other less developed country should be made mandatory for all school children to teach empathy and compassion.Mandatory team sports should be a part of every student's life to teach the importance of teamwork, team strategy and peer support.Entrepreneurial training should be incorporated into the school curriculum to groom a new generation of Singaporean business owners.
The education system must be tweaked to bring out the best in our future Singapore generations. The students today will not only shape Singapore's destiny but likely play a key role in future regional or even global social, economic and political landscape.
David Leong Managing Director PeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd
GEORGE Orwell in Animal Farm said: 'All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.' Despite the socialisation effect of society, there is bound to be some better than others never mind how you grade them, band them or give them other names. The net effect of doing away with banding is perhaps to reduce the derisory effect on non-performing schools and the ferocity of competition among schools, causing stress among students and therefore causing stress among parents. This causative effect is really inevitable but we have to understand that calling a spade something else will not solve the problem. A spade is still a spade.
We must agree that holistic education development is important and the academic scorecard is one, but not the whole, thrust of the education. Other developmental areas like creative thinking, social skills, leadership development and whole person development, including values inculcation, are important.
As our society evolves into a developed state, our hard focus on academic numbers alone is no longer enough. Though there is no one yardstick to measure the effectiveness of a school now with the banding taken out, we should not lose sight of the idea that we still want to have good educational output and a strong and robust educational framework that will measure success through a myriad of metrics. These metrics must be clearly defined by the ministry. In business, we are measured first by our 'Profit and Loss' and 'Balance Sheet'. Perhaps, students can be measured by their monthly 'P&L' by identifying the 'revenue areas' and the 'expenses items' they need to work on to produce a better bottom line - a whole person education outcome.
The 'Balance Sheet' approach will, therefore, mean that the student's whole education journey will be mapped on a unique personal 'Balance Sheet' with his/her assets and liabilities identified, with a commitment to work on the liabilities over the course of the educational journey. This will reduce the stress of having to perform well on one academic scorecard.
Lim Soon Hock Managing Director PLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd
MANY teachers and parents still place meritocracy at the centre of our education system, despite our government's efforts to promote a rounded education that includes character-building and the inculcation of values. There is nothing wrong with meritocracy per se, but because it focuses on academic and scholastic excellence, it has inadvertently bred 'kiasuism', which is unhealthy. Much of the angst and stress face by students, parents and educators today, are the result of this 'kiasuism'.
If the announced changes to transform our education system are to achieve the intended outcomes, our education system has to move away from a focus on meritocracy to one of talent-centricity. A talent-centric system, apart from embracing academic excellence, promotes excellence in other non-academic fields such as the arts, sports, music, volunteerism and community service, to name a few. The whole of our government needs to make this paradigm shift to pronounce less on meritocracy and to promote more on talent-centricity, if we are to kill 'kiasuism'.
Our education system is one of the best in the world, as is evident from the spectacular performance of many of our students in global academic competitions and in tertiary institutions overseas. If there is one bold step that all stakeholders - educators, parents, the general public - need to take to 'work together to shape our education system' for our children, and Singapore's future, it has to be a determined effort to remove 'kiasuism' altogether, that is anaemic to our system.

","   How has your business, and/or businesses in your industry, been affected by the tighter foreign labour measures? How can the current foreign worker policy be tweaked to meet the needs of the private sector, and Singaporeans generally?
John Keung CEO Building and Construction Authority
CONSTRUCTION firms are likely to feel the impact of tighter foreign labour measures, because of easy access to low-cost foreign labour in the past. However, it would not be sustainable if we allow our foreign construction workforce to grow without limits in the long term. Companies will also have less incentive to improve productivity and use technology to substitute labour. At the same time, countries such as China and India are also accelerating their pace of development and increasing their own demand for workers, making it more challenging for local companies to attract the same supply of foreign workers without increasing real wages.
Instead of a business-as-usual mindset, it is high time that construction firms rethink the way that they carry out the construction process and switch to more productive construction methods to meet their business needs. Through incentives from the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF) and manpower training schemes, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) will continue to support more progressive companies in the construction industry, to stay competitive and achieve sustained growth in a tighter labour market.
Ho Meng Kit CEO Singapore Business Federation
PLAYING our role as a bridge between the business community and government, I have the following messages to them.
To businesses: The impact of foreigners on our resident population is real and serious. Businesses must bite the bullet and reform. Raise productivity, be less reliant on cheaper foreign workers, employ more Singaporeans PMETs (professionals, managers, executives and technicians).
To government: Be pragmatic and flexible in the implementation of foreign workers' restrictions. Help small businesses adjust to this new environment. Be careful that we do not erode Singapore's reputation as the top Asian city in welcoming global talent and businesses.
Deb Loveridge Managing Director for Asia-Pacific Randstad
WITH 2 per cent unemployment, Singapore has a very tight labour market and companies are under a great deal of pressure to secure the right talent. A number of our clients are faced with this reality currently. If over the long term Singapore continues to face constrained labour supply, this could have an impact on productivity and economic growth.
Randstad's World of Work Report 2012/13, due for release in mid-October, shows that the No 1 human capital challenge in Singapore is attracting new talent for the next phase of growth; and recruiting more people from overseas (45 per cent) is the No 1 strategy that employers believe that they need to take to address talent scarcity in the next decade.
The challenge for companies will be to continue ''balance building'' a strong local workforce with foreign talent (both white and blue collar workers). While the social impact of foreign workers needs to be considered, further tightening of foreign labour quotas could have the unintended consequence of constraining business growth.
John Ng Peng Wah CEO PowerSeraya
YTL PowerSeraya believes in hiring candidates on the basis of their strengths and merits - their knowledge, skills, abilities and competencies - while building a Singaporean core in our company.
According to the Hiring Trends Report 2012, one in two companies indicated that Singaporeans are becoming choosy when looking for work. This may be expected as the workforce becomes more affluent. Singapore's per capita gross domestic product (GDP), already one of the highest in the world and forecast to increase into 2050, would indicate a workforce with increased affluence. This will lead to many locals shunning certain jobs considered as less attractive.
Although the universities and polytechnics are producing graduates with technical skill sets which will potentially become a talent pool for engineering industries, the reality is that engineering graduates may continue to pursue non-technical career options in hospitality, finance and entrepreneurship outside the engineering industry. Consequently, there is a need to hire foreign workers to fill the manpower gaps required in sustaining the engineering industry.
Hence, it is important that the foreign worker policy be tightened with care and caution to allow local businesses the needed flexibility to hire requisite foreign manpower to support key operational requirements.
Choun Chee Kong Managing Director Edenred Pte Ltd
HAVE a COE (certificate of entitlement) for foreign labour which companies can auction for and determine the real value of a foreign worker. Similar to road usage, additional population inflow strains the infrastructure, worsens congestion and adds hidden social costs and inflationary pressures. A COE system will reverse the situation currently where the company hiring the foreign worker enjoys access to additional resources, but it's society at large that pays for the social costs and inflation. A bidding system will force companies to calculate their sums and think twice before hiring foreign workers.
Continuing the tweaking of the foreign worker policies will continue to result in complaints from the private sector as well as disgruntled local voters. The COE system has been a very effective tool in managing the growth in traffic. So why not a similarly transparent system for managing foreign labour?
Different categories can be introduced for different categories of labour, again similar to vehicle bidding. To minimise the impact on the overall costs of labour, the proceeds from the foreign labour COE can be ploughed back by the government into subsidising the costs of CPF contribution for local labour. This effectively lowers the costs and promotes the hiring of local labour as well as optimises the usage of foreign workers.
Bill Lee Country Manager SAS Singapore
THE decision to hire local or foreign should always be based on need and meritocracy. That is the only way to maintain Singapore's competitiveness and to ensure acceptable growth. In certain sectors, there is clearly a shortage of necessary skill if we do not look to foreign sources to complement local ones.
Business analytics is one such sector, and it contributes high added value to our economy. To address longer-term viability, SAS works with the Singapore government and institutions of higher learning to introduce this critical skill into curricula and create programmes to develop professionals who want to be retooled or retrained. In this way, we are able to reduce our dependency on foreign talent over time.
Annie Yap Managing Director AYP Associates Pte Ltd
FROM my experience in the recruitment sector, businesses are actually learning to cope with the tighter laws. More companies are using technology to automate lower-skilled functions. Cross-training, so that employees are skilled in various roles, is an increasingly popular strategy. Companies are also exploring new sources of employment, such as homemakers, by devising flexible hours or work-from-home job packages. Moving out or shutting down seems to be a drastic last resort, even for SMEs.
Nonetheless, more frequent reviews of foreign labour policies will be welcome to cater to different sectors and businesses. More autonomy can be given to officers at the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to allow policy flexibility on a case-by-case basis. This will greatly alleviate pressures on companies, at least in the short run, by buying time to find suitable alternative solutions.
Sharon Lim Executive Director Pacific Time Pte Ltd
THE burning question is how corporate Singapore can gradually decrease its addiction to low-cost foreign labour. The falling productivity growth has been attributed to companies' reliance on low-cost foreign labour instead of investing in training and technology. Over the last years, the pendulum has swung so much to the other side that companies may be hiring foreigners without putting in the requisite effort to hire locals. When the hiring managers are also foreigners, it becomes inevitable that they will favour foreigners as they naturally find it easier to work with and manage people of similar cultural affinity.
It is feared that an over-restrictive policy will force companies, not just SMEs but also certain divisions of larger companies, to relocate their operations to other countries. However, this may be positive for the country in the long run. For example, the relocation of a 100-strong company that employs 90 per cent foreign labour will result in 10 local jobs lost. However, Singapore will also have less social costs and inflationary pressures from 90 less foreign workers. In any case, for companies that rely so heavily on low-cost foreign labour to remain competitive, we should question if they can remain viable and competitive.
Pramod Ratwani President & Executive Chairman Consilium Software Inc
WE are in a niche industry and need skill sets which are difficult to get locally, and we have faced difficulties when hiring or inviting staff from our overseas locations for short periods. The criteria and yardsticks to get overseas expertise on short- or long-term attachments need to be tweaked, and more categories should be allowed. For example, if companies want to bring in interim expertise for 6-12 months to train local staff or help with projects, this does not fit into any category today. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) is also getting strict and refusing entry to staff after they arrive here on valid business visas; and this has created uncertainty in our overseas staff, and many refuse to travel to Singapore. This does not go well with the ''business friendly destination'' image that Singapore is trying to create.
Mindy Tan CEO Newstead Technologies
INEVITABLY, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and home-grown businesses have to compete with multinational corporations (MNCs) in an already tight workforce market to grow and, for some local businesses, to even survive. A contracting foreign labour market and the foreign labour policy in Singapore affects certain service industries more - such as the retail sector that we are in, and the food and beverage (F&B) industry, to name a few.
The impact on the cost of doing business has become apparent more recently - high demand and low supply of Singaporean workers have driven manpower costs up; productivity has also dipped along with the manpower shortage, replacement and retraining challenges. I believe that our foreign labour policy should take into careful consideration the different industries and trades that have different manpower needs. This will put balance back into labour-intensive industries such as retail, which traditionally have jobs that are less popular with locals.
Philippe H J Huinck Regional Managing Director, South and South-east Asia International SOS
WITH its global headquarters here in Singapore, International SOS needs to serve its wide international client base that is spread around the world. The diversity of multilingual employees at the medical and security assistance centres is critical in providing timely and culturally sensitive assistance to clients. Tighter foreign labour measures are indeed impacting our business model as a too-limited talent pool can affect the quality of service and accurate responsiveness. This can be critical in the emergency situations that our staff are addressing daily.
While following a pragmatic approach in hiring new staff, in line with Singapore's workforce policies and supporting the employment of local Singaporeans, International SOS believes that the government should continue to adopt a flexible approach for industries that provide services to a predominantly international clientele. For certain specialised jobs, this may mean employing non-Singaporeans if the skill sets are not readily available locally. In such situations, it would be helpful in relaxing the foreign workforce measures on a case-by-case basis.
Lynne Ng Regional Director Adecco SEA Adecco Personnel Pte Ltd
A RECRUITMENT company like Adecco is often the first to feel the immediate impact of new or shifts in policies and regulations. The very core of our business is human capital management, and understanding the ever-changing demands of the competitive workplace is key. Certainly, there has been an ongoing debate on this subject with impact on both social and economic fronts. However, from a recruiter's perspective, the topmost priority is to find the best talent - matching the right candidate to the right job. That focus will not change. Given the current situation, it is likely that there will continue to be a balance of both local and foreign talent.
Nick Foley President, South-east Asia & Pacific Landor
LABOUR laws are part and parcel of all markets. For us, the laws don't need tweaking. Instead, businesses (and their human resource teams) should tweak their approach, not vice versa.
At Landor, ideas are our lifeline. Building brands - whether they're consumer, corporate or not for profit - requires our people to think differently. We have an approach that pushes this type of thinking within our business. This means that we search for people with attitude, personality and drive. Also, we don't just search for people from one specific area of experience - allowing us to cast a wider net.
Phillip Overmyer Chief Executive Singapore International Chamber of Commerce (SICC)
SEVERAL of our Chamber members have been affected by the increase in labour costs and the decline in manpower necessary to serve customer needs. The market slowdown that we are now experiencing has softened the need for new staff. However, our members, especially the MNCs, are most concerned that when the market starts to recover, there will simply not be enough skilled workforce in Singapore to support their businesses.
And this applies to both mid-level and executive staff. The key reason for our members' worry is that the reduction of foreign skilled workers will require new operational plans; but more importantly, our members do not feel confident that there is a long-term plan from the government as to how foreign skilled labour will be received in Singapore. The government needs to assure companies of the reasonable likelihood that positions will continue to exist for foreign skilled workers at various levels. Without this confidence, the SICC fears that as markets start to recover, foreign skilled workers - and especially highly skilled research and executive level staff - will not find Singapore an attractive market for them to consider because of a lack of certainty that their jobs will be allowed to continue in Singapore for at least a few years.
And as other markets in Asia continue to grow, there will be many interesting opportunities for skilled people to pursue their careers outside Singapore. Therefore, policies could be tweaked to extend the period of stay for foreign workers with skills and knowledge that Singapore does not have enough of, such as professionals in the research & development (R&D) industry which is complex and unique. The government could also look at customising foreign worker policies and regulations according to different industry needs, such as increasing the foreign worker quotas for certain industries that are not appealing to Singaporeans. MNCs that use Singapore as a corporate headquarters location should also be given greater flexibility in bringing in trainees from other countries.
Balancing the needs of businesses with expectations of Singaporeans can be challenging. As the small local workforce is already stretched in supporting both existing and new investments here, Singaporeans should recognise that foreign workers are necessary to add value to their companies that ultimately will support their own growth.
Mark Billington Regional Director South-east Asia ICAEW
THERE is an existing talent squeeze in the accountancy sector, and recent tightening measures have worsened the problem. Mid-tier and small accountancy firms have been hit hardest because local graduates tend to gravitate towards banks and the Big Four, so they often look overseas for new entrants into the profession. Even though mid-tier firms pay just as well as the Big Four, and are often also very generous with training and benefits, they are forced recruit talent from places such as China, the Philippines and Vietnam to meet demand. They want to recruit good local talent and are willing to pay competitive rates, but the current realities of the industry means that they are unable to.
The authorities need to consider the nuances of each sector and put in place tailored approaches that acknowledge the unique difficulties that each industry faces. Ultimately, the losers are the SMEs and small-cap companies that need the services provided by mid-tier and small accounting practices. With continual labour shortages, they will not be able to get them.
Joshua Yim CEO Achieve Group
AS a recruitment and human resource development consultancy, we are an intermediary for companies' recruitment needs. One of our areas of business is to bring foreign workers into Singapore on behalf of our clients. Another area is the job placement of locals and PRs, which makes up a larger part of our business. So the tighter foreign labour measures do not affect us that much, unless they are accompanied by a reduction of recruitment needs in Singapore's overall employment market.
Our hearts go out to other businesses that really need foreign workers to survive, such as SMEs in the construction and F&B industry that have a hard time adjusting to the new rules. The tighter measures will be crippling for some sectors, and I believe that there will be a levelling of industries.
I have spoken with many CEOs about this, and most are resigned to accepting the tighter measures and are not even hoping for a U-turn on the policy. So their focus is on how to manoeuvre within the new framework and solve this problem. We need to think out of the box and come up with more effective and innovative ways of doing things to improve productivity and to survive, whether by incorporating automation into our business processes or other measures. Ultimately, it will be a matter of survival of the fittest.
Paul Endacott Managing Director, South-east Asia Ambition Singapore
IN the white collar space in which Ambition recruits, there are certainly constraints in hiring foreigners - especially in the application of visas for temporary and contract appointments in information technology (IT) and finance. We actively encourage the recruitment of local staff into positions based in Singapore (and this is our clients' preference) but there are cultural barriers with many Singaporean jobseekers not wishing to entertain temporary positions. Instead, there is a preference for permanent roles.
If Singapore is to see a thriving contracting market then the government needs to have a more open approach to approving visas for short-term work.
Ronald Lee Managing Director PrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd
BEING in the recruitment business, we have a vested interest in the foreign labour policy as it impacts most of our clients that engage our services in their hunt for talent - local or otherwise. We hear the same complaint from many employers about the labour crunch, and we empathise with their difficulty in finding the right talent for their business needs. The tighter foreign worker measures do exacerbate these workforce issues.
Societal pressures have forced the government's hand in calibrating the inflow of foreign workers, and it is indeed a very delicate process. It is unlikely that a single solution can be developed to please all parties, from satisfying the needs of the local workforce to ensuring a sustainable pipeline of talent for the business community. It is quite natural that certain industries and types of jobs are more heavily reliant on foreign workers.
The authorities should thus conduct in-depth assessments of the different needs of the various sectors and design their policies accordingly. Unfortunately, blanket rulings may not work for this. Additionally, any measures that are developed cannot be too drastic, as companies need time to adapt and restructure their business models if necessary.
Zaheer Merchant Regional Director (Singapore & Europe) QI Group of Companies
THE QI Group takes pride in its mixed staff nationalities. It adds talent, creativity and vibrancy. We ensure a balance between Singaporeans and foreign labour, and give preference to locals, but have found difficulties here.
One facet of our business in Singapore, for instance, is travel/tourism-related where we require Russian speakers for a customer service position. It is virtually impossible to find a Singaporean to fill this position. We have found it becoming a common problem in a global company like ours in servicing a significant customer base in regions such as the Middle East, Africa and Russia. In keeping with the government's concept of offshore diversification, we have diversified our business. However, the tighter quotas and higher levies on foreign labour affect our efforts to fill key positions. We became ''double whammied''.
We would benefit greatly from an intensive business study in consultation between the relevant ministries and businesses/SMEs in this precise connection. It would allow critical understanding in an industry-specific manner of the needs of the private sector. Specific criteria, qualifications and business requirements can be taken into consideration with some precision, aside from the bonus of collating valuable data for demographics. Dubai is a prime example where qualified foreign workers are employed in a studied fashion.
David Leong Managing Director PeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd
THE substitution effect of our Singapore indigenous labour by foreigners is less pronounced at the top than at the bottom of the labour hierarchy. As our economy evolves and grows, it is almost certain that Singapore requires a larger support base of skilled workers to support critical industries in oil and gas, pharmaceutical and electronic manufacturing, construction and service sectors. The choke point for labour is mostly at this level of workers - with a salary of less than $1,500 per month.
Calibration of foreign labour input is necessary to ensure that Singaporeans' jobs are not substituted with cheap imported labour but not until businesses are choked off with an important factor of production - labour, indigenous or foreign. I have witnessed companies reeling in operational difficulties in fulfilling orders and deliveries because they cannot find sufficient Singaporeans permanent, transient, contract or casual workers to fill the labour gap. Companies may be forced to close due to inhibiting labour limits enforced by MOM's recent labour tightening.
MOM should review the dependency ratio based on the grade of jobs defined by pay pegs (equalised with imposition of levies and tiers based on the number of foreigners employed), industry/sector and the number of Singaporeans employed. MOM should consider providing a quota booster - employment of elderly workers or unemployed Singaporean workers taken out of a registered unemployment roll. A national database of unemployed workers can be registered, tracked, trained and deployed. A booster will allow a company to add a certain percentage to their foreign hires if they recruit senior workers or take in unemployed Singaporeans. This way, there is a direct proportionate relationship between hiring foreigners and reducing the unemployment rate.
The current labour crunch cannot persist until companies die of manpower asphyxiation. A dead company tells no tales. A re-look by MOM of labour needs and the equation of supply is sorely needed at this juncture.
Patrick Liew CEO HSR Global Limited
CS Lewis was once quoted to have said that we are people of extremes. There may be some truth in that statement because in the recent past, we have pushed for economic growth and accepted more foreign workers than what our infrastructure can reasonably support. I suspect that we have swung to another extreme by tightening the labour market beyond what our SMEs can effectively handle. As a result of the relatively low unemployment rate, labour costs have generally gone up. Job hopping is rearing its ugly head and meanwhile, productivity continues to be on a decline.
The question that begs to be answered is: Are we calibrating for political currency or for socio-economic gains? To resolve this challenge and prevent it from becoming a vicious cycle, we may need to start by taking a top-down approach, beginning with changing the mindset of policymakers. As many of them have not operated or operated long enough in the private sector, they cannot be deemed to comprehend the multiple issues faced by SMEs and the tightrope that they are walking on.
There are also no major indications that our key politicians are actively engaging SMEs so as to fully appreciate their challenges and sentiments. By analysing surveys based on historical information, my fear is that by the time they realise that SMEs cannot expand their operations, or worse, have to close down or relocate overseas, the resulting damage might have become irreparable and caused other cascading effects.
R Dhinakaran Managing Director Jay Gee Enterprises Pte Ltd
WHILE the government's policies on tightening controls on foreign labour may be driven by an analysis at a very macro level, in reality it has crippled labour-dependent service industries such as retail and F&B. These businesses require labour with the right aptitude and attitude to take in long hours of work including on weekends, which is not acceptable to many locals today. The shortage of labour has literally crippled the service sector in the recent past. It has resulted in further declining productivity with too few staff to serve at retail stores, affecting service levels which may ultimately result in loss of business as well. While local businesses intend to employ more local labour, local jobseekers do not prefer jobs in the retail sector.
The generalised approach towards foreign labour restrictions is causing a severe imbalance in terms of talent available and talent needed by each industry. While the tedious way of segregating industry sectors and analysing needs and availability may be something that the government wants to avoid, a blanket rule unfortunately continues to affect genuine businesses.
David Low CEO Futuristic Store Fixtures Pte Ltd
WITH woodworks manufacturing being the core operations, the bulk of our manpower is based in facilities outside Singapore with only the international sales and administrative teams located here. This is the same for our industry in general, hence we are suitably cushioned from changes to foreign manpower growth.
However, our industry and retail growth are tightly knitted; and the retail sector can be greatly affected by overtly conservative measures. It is a delicate balance in managing manpower allocation in terms of talent placement and filling gaps of employment where the local community alone may not produce the numbers and diversity of the skill sets required.
Existing measures should be tested for a longer period of time to determine the viability of addressing both manpower issues and social concerns before reining in tighter controls. I reckon that greater transparency on foreign labour policy and the effects of such policy on both social and economic aspects is needed, and grassroots leaders play an important role in communicating such messages across to the general masses. It is important to garner support from all levels for any policy to be effectively implemented and maintained. A 3-5 per cent economic growth is relatively encouraging and sustainable with current measures, and this growth will in turn generate revenue to counter social costs including housing and transportation management to receive a growing population from both organic and inorganic sources.
Ang Swee Meng, Allen Group Managing Director Aldon Technologies Services Pte Ltd
LABOUR cost is always a significant component of business costs in the manufacturing industry. Tighter foreign labour policy will inevitably translate to higher labour costs. Some manufacturing SMEs may not have the resilience to survive a sharp and sudden cost increase. They may be forced to close their businesses or relocate to a lower cost site, resulting in job losses.
The solution for manufacturing SMEs is not just about raising productivity. Spring and its predecessors, PSB and NPB, had been helping SMEs to raise productivity since the 1980s. During the 1990s, the EDB mounted a national industrial automation campaign aimed at helping local companies to automate. The real problem then, as it is now, is the difficulty in attracting capable locals to work in manufacturing SMEs because of the presence of a large number of MNCs. There is a limit to how much productivity gains that a company can reap with the best automation and productivity improvement programmes if it cannot recruit skilled workers and technicians. Foreign workers had in the past filled the gap and helped SMEs maintain their competitiveness, and many thrived and have become successful.
I don't think that foreign labour is directly affecting productivity. However, because the social costs of foreign labour have reached a critical level, the government has to adjust its policies to reduce our dependency on it. I hope the government will phase in the policy changes gradually so as to give SMEs like Aldon Technologies time to implement productivity measures and adjust to the impact.
Ultimately, government and industry have to address the problem of lack of interest among locals to work in manufacturing SMEs. I believe that the solution starts with our education system. I am glad to know that the government has recently been mulling over a new university model in which students alternate between semesters of full-time study and relevant paid work. This model may change mindsets and release many undergraduates to work with SMEs while they are pursuing their education and at the same time provide relief to the tight labour market.
Low Lee Yong CEO MHC Asia Group Pte Ltd
THE measures to tighten the influx of foreign labour have been felt by businesses. But its impact has been minimal for us because we were not overly reliant on foreign labour. At MHC, we have been on the lookout for good local talent because we need people who understand Singapore well. Of equal importance, we also believe that raising productivity is the most sustainable way forward for us as well as for our partners and corporate clients. As the supply of foreign labour is tightened, perhaps measures could also be put in place to help businesses to cope and also to hire local talents including older workers.
Lim Soon Hock Managing Director Plan-B ICAG Pte Ltd
THE issue is the pace at which the inflow of foreign labour is tightened. The reality is that even companies which subscribe to a ''hire local'' policy have difficulties in hiring for jobs which Singaporeans shun, such as construction workers, waiters, cleaners, and many of a manual nature. Companies, such as SMEs, must be given more time, leeway and flexibility, to adjust to this new measure.
Having said this, it is critical at this stage of our development that the ''hire local'' policy be applied with greater discipline and circumspection, across all positions, including top management, in the public, private and people sectors. At the macro level, every foreign worker, irrespective of position, adds to the demands on our public infrastructure and social amenities. The situation can only get worse with our planned infrastructural developments, new property developments, new factories being built to accomodate new investments, and more caregivers being needed for our ageing population.
One way to balance this inflow - and it is not a panacea - is to encourage more Singaporeans, especially our younger adults and perhaps retirees with valuable work experience and expertise, to work overseas. Our government can consider offering incentives to promote this, as there are benefits to be derived for Singapore and the individual, as we connect wider and deeper with the world.
Liu Chunlin CEO K&C Protective Technologies Pte Ltd
FOR our business which is the specialised security protective engineering sector, we are not directly affected as we do not depend on foreign labour. But anecdotally from our dealings with other companies, I suspect that the effect of tighter foreign labour depends very much on specific industries and businesses. Some companies in the building construction sector appear to be less optimistic about construction opportunities and may in fact be more concerned over securing projects than having enough manpower resources. For those which have already secured mega projects, their concern over tight labour may be well founded.
OVERALL, I certainly agree that productivity is key - I guess the national policy is not meant to prop up unproductive businesses, as this might lead to a hard landing later on when reality hits. Thus a calibrated approach as talked about, rather than a broad stroke, is certainly warranted. Such an approach while facilitating structural adjustments should nevertheless support specific industries or projects within an industry deemed to have good prospects. Otherwise, the medicine can hurt rather than cure.
At the national level, the issue has to be managed in terms of the citizens' perception too. A tight foreign labour policy cuts both ways. It may put a brake on business growth and possibly reduce jobs, or it can open up jobs to locals otherwise taken up by foreign labour. How it will pan out and benefit the nation and citizens will be a delicate balancing act - especially at a time when a recession appears more imminent than before.
Dora Hoan Group CEO Best World International Ltd
IT is a fact that Singapore businesses are facing shortage of low-skilled labour, especially for the booming F&B, retail and building & construction industries. To implement both policies of tightening the foreign labour quota and increasing the foreign worker levy concurrently will undoubtedly increase the cost of doing business and create growth constrains.
One direct way of helping and rewarding low-income employees (say, for those drawing less than $2,500 monthly) is the government's effort to utilise the collected levy by distributing it to the CPF accounts of all low-income Singaporean employees.
One important note is that any increment of levy must allow sufficient time for companies to adjust their manpower costing.

","   What are the values you would like to see as an integral part of Singapore society, and why? What can people, and corporate leaders in particular, do to propagate these values?
Janet Ang Managing Director IBM Singapore
VALUES are critical. Some companies manage by rules. Others by hierarchies. IBM manages by our values.
This is why in 2003, IBM undertook the first re-examination of our values in nearly 100 years through ''Values-Jam'' - an unprecedented 72-hour global marathon on IBM-developed Jam technology and analysed by sophisticated text analysis software to mine the online comments from over 50,000 employees. The result is a set of core values, defined by IBMers for IBMers, that shape the way we lead, the way we decide, and the way we act. Perhaps it's time for a national conversation to uncover the values that define a Singapore that has evolved considerably from nearly half a century ago?
Regardless of what values guide each community - be they country or company - the Golden Rule, ''Do unto others what you want done unto you'', cannot be far from right. In fact, in today's increasingly borderless global community - where the world is our neighbour - we should take it further by treating others as they would like to be treated. To do this, we will need to take the time to observe, understand and empathise with what is important for others, just as if it's the same as our own. From this environment of mutual respect and co-creation, there can only be positives to be gained for all.
Nick Foley President, South-east Asia & Pacific Landor
ONE of the great aspects to Singapore is its ''mixing pot of different cultures''. Somehow, despite this fusion with so many people from diverse backgrounds, one core value has been overlooked: benevolence. Singaporeans need to find more occasions to demonstrate their compassion for others.
Landor Associates has 70 years of experience in building brands. Sometimes we get asked to create new brand values for countries or cities. If Landor was helping Singapore to progress its brand persona, we'd look at values that brought out Singapore's caring side. Mutuality, reciprocity, compassion, empathy and the ability to nurture are all values that would help balance Singapore's successful and entrepreneurial spirit.
Singapore is such a productive and special place. Its image among other developed nations will only improve if it can shift the perception to being one that is generous in spirit.
Hugues Delcourt Country Executive, ABN Amro Bank NV Singapore; and Chief Executive Officer of ABN Amro Private Banking Asia & Middle East
A CONUNDRUM facing many people caught up in the corporate rat race is the lack of time and space not only for themselves, but also their families. Personally, I would like to see greater emphasis on the value of family togetherness, as strong family ties play an important role as an anchor in the lives of individuals, which in turn helps to create a stronger social fabric for Singapore as a whole.
Besides the pursuit of material comfort, greater empathy for our fellow men is also key to cultivating a congenial living environment which improves lives in ways that tangible gains cannot provide, and for the society to function as a truly gracious one.
Companies can play a role in making these values part of the Singapore society, by empowering their employees and promoting these causes internally. At ABN Amro, we encourage our staff to work hard, play hard and to pursue other interests in life that contribute to their own and their family's well-being via company-organised and sponsored social and CSR activities and family days. We also practise diversity in staff hiring from across all races and creeds based on merit, thus creating an environment where people from different cultures work closely together and learn from each other.
I am excited that Singapore is embarking on this journey to create its unique identity. With the right mindset, attitude and proactive effort from all parties, I believe we are definitely on the right track to making Singapore an even better place to work and live in.
Toby Koh Group Managing Director Ademco Security Group
COMPASSION, kindness and tolerance are evident in many Singaporeans on a daily basis. As an individual, parent, friend or colleague, we can each in our small way encourage people we meet to practise such values.
Each and every corporation should have a corporate social responsibility programme to give back to society and display the very values that we want to encourage. In Ademco, we practise CSR both in monetary terms as well as in person. Such activities help to bond our staff which comprise foreign talent too, and integrate them into Singapore's community. When Singaporeans see our foreign talent helping in non-profit organisations and other worthy causes, it also increases acceptance. This is one positive step to making Singapore a happy and cohesive nation.
David Dzienciol Regional Vice-President and General Manager, Asia Pacific Parallels Software Pte Ltd
SINGAPOREANS have always valued excellence and achievement. This has helped propel Singapore from a developing country to a First World nation. However, as the country continues to develop and its residents get wealthier, the pursuit of material goods and services sometimes distracts us from being gracious citizens. While being go-getters is good, Singaporeans should also consider how teamwork, openness and respect are important values that need to become an integral part of Singapore society, a city state that is a melting pot of different cultures and backgrounds.
The diversity of Singapore resembles that of Parallels. We were founded in Singapore by a Russian businessman (who is a Singapore citizen) but currently have our corporate headquarters in USA. Our senior management comprises different nationalities and many have brought with them experience in top MNCs from around the world.
With such a diverse mix of people, it poses a huge challenge for us to create a culture that accepts both similarities and differences at the same time, but we have done so because it is imperative for our success.
In order to propagate these values, corporate leaders need to lead by example. Only by exemplifying the meaning of teamwork, openness and respect in their actions and behaviour towards employees can they create this culture that will exist throughout the entire organisation.
Low Lee Yong CEO & Founder MHC Medical Network
KINDNESS and inclusiveness are important values as Singapore's society becomes more diverse.
We live in a fast-paced society where many people work long hours. Yes, I agree we need to show more kindness to one another, and people will respond to kindness with kindness. Kindness begins with each individual regardless of whether we are leaders or not.
I also think that inclusiveness is important. As our society becomes aged, it is very important to never forget the contributions our senior citizens have made to our country's progress. As Singapore continues to grow, we must include them as we share the fruits of the growth story.
David Leong Managing Director PeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd
INTERPRETING Singapore's graciousness and societal values from the impact of culture and the role of change processes by governmental intervention is needed to understand Singapore's societal norm. Singapore's government has a strong hand to mould and shape societal values through national campaigns like the National Courtesy Campaign in 1979 and the Singapore Kindness Movement in 1996.
Although kindness, graciousness and courtesy are acknowledged as universal social values, these values should be embedded values within society. The most valued principle still alive in Japanese society today is the concept of ''wa'', or ''harmony''. The preservation of social harmony dates back to the first constitution in 604 AD where the society and community harmony precede the notion of ''self''. In business terms, ''wa'' is reflected in the avoidance of self-assertion and individualism and the preservation of good relationships.
In Singapore's multi-racial and multi-cultural societal structures, such tolerance is paramount and the notion of collective assertiveness and togetherness above ''self'' must be shaped from a socialisation process. Such socialisation process must be initiated in schools since young and not from a workplace environment. In the workplace context, corporate culture may bind individuals to sets of values.
In the end, it is about building a harmonious society, and acts of graciousness and kindness are the resultant behaviour of our harmonious society.
Charlie Foo Vice-President Brocade Asia Pacific
SINGAPORE'S biggest resource is its people who have helped propel our economy's growth and put us on the global stage.
Being a small country, the actions of individuals can become associated with Singapore as a whole. It is therefore essential that we improve on our core values of empathy, respect and tolerance.
Business leaders can lead from the front and spearhead policies that promote a culture of mutual respect and teamwork based on a set of key values. A key component is to organise activities that allow employees to bond at a more personal level, where they will go out of their way to help and motivate each other.
Philippe HJ Huinck Regional Managing Director, South and South East Asia International SOS
AS THE country continues to face rapid population growth and an increasingly diverse community, maintaining a kind society is becoming a real challenge.
Nevertheless, from giving up a seat for an elderly in the bus to volunteering to help onboard a newly arrived foreign worker, Singaporeans from all walks of life are doing their bit to contribute to a kinder society.
A certain level of selflessness, empathy and a real appreciation for diversity are what, among others, make up a better Singapore.
As business leaders we should always encourage these values in the workplace and embed them in the way they conduct business. This will obviously help to foster business relationships, while in parallel it contributes to a kinder Singapore.
At International SOS, we too do our bit to contribute to this vision. Our philosophy of ''Worldwide Reach, Human Touch'' underpins what we do for our patients, customers and staff on a daily basis.
Simon Barlow President, Asia Pacific Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group
AT CARLSON Rezidor Hotel Group, we are driven by and rooted in a strong set of values exemplifying the bold entrepreneurial spirit and high quality standards embodied by our founder, Curtis L Carlson. We encourage our employees to live the Carlson values of Integrity, Innovation, Customer Focus, Empowerment, Accountability, Responsibility and C-Factor, which is daring to be different in a fun and rewarding way. Each year on Values Day, all employees around the world get together to reflect and reaffirm their commitment to these values, which act as a guiding light to better understand how their actions help Carlson Rezidor attain its highest aspirations in service to each other, to our business partners, our guests and to the communities we work and live in.
By living these shared values within our organisation, we hopefully become part of a multiplier effect that is aligned with the aspirations of Singaporeans who want a kinder, more gracious society.
Karl Chong CEO Groupon Singapore
WE AT Groupon see profitability in being socially conscious by prioritising corporate responsibility. For example, kindness is a core value of Groupon Singapore that is integrated into our operational philosophy and execution, propagated through the way we treat our customers, merchants and employees.
For customers, we deliver great customer service with a smile and ensure we achieve first contact resolution to live up to the Groupon Promise. For merchants, we prioritise and train our relationship managers to interact kindly with them, regardless of the situation.
Lastly, we take a personal interest in the professional and personal growth of our employees, instilling a sense of kindness, through personal training and monthly town hall meetings.
We live in an age where social responsibility is a necessity, and corporations can play a larger role to influence and inspire the younger generations by the contributions and impact of their behaviour.
Zaheer Merchant Regional Director (Singapore & Europe) QI Group of Companies
MY WISH for Singapore is for it to become a more inclusive and gracious society. This includes the way we generally communicate and treat people with common courtesy. It would make for a more conducive environment which in turn permeates every facet of life. If one element means treating people with dignity, respect and fairness regardless of race, economic status or a different viewpoint, then as corporate leaders, we need to walk the talk.
Aside from achieving profits, which is important, companies should also focus on building a workforce that is gracious and selfless. Involve staff in CSR programmes which benefit society and themselves, yet crucially treat them right. The adage, ''good begets good'', holds true and our actions ultimately reflect upon us.
We've found that once employees see the positive difference they're making, it makes them more understanding and respectful of the community they live in, and compels them to work towards making an even bigger change. We are ultimately the change we want to be. As Professor Tommy Koh noted in the recent debate, it makes for us ''wanting'' to be kinder.
Values that make a society proud of itself are generosity and perhaps social justice. They result in a society that gives, and not just takes.
Daniel Soh Managing Partner Leadership Advisory Inc
THE importance of integrity and accountability can't be overstated. A person without integrity is like a house built on sand. Today, information is widely accessible, people expect to be more inclusive, and things happen much faster than before. No doubt our environment has become more interconnected and complex in recent years; we need to live with strong integrity and a deep sense of accountability. While this seems like a given, just take a look at all that have happened in the US and European banking sectors over the last few years, and you will see what I mean.
For corporate leaders, be prepared to lead by example and ''walk the talk''. It earns you the right to have responsibility over others. Secondly, be authentic and have empathy for people across different races, religions and cultures. This will naturally draw faithful followers who respect what you value. Be realistic too. Every organisation's means are limited by today's economics. Foolish egos and greed unfortunately have led to many downfalls. Hence I believe it is very important to work hard without being blindly ambitious.
Susie Martin General Manager, South East Asia and India Servcorp
KINDNESS is a two-way proposition. As a leader in providing world-class service to our clients, we strongly believe that true service comes from genuine caring and kindness. In return, when a customer or guest receives great service, they can do their part and acknowledge the efforts a team has put in, in delivering the best possible experience for them.
Another example of how corporations can incorporate a kind work culture is their long-term commitment to their team, especially during a financial crisis. The first reaction for many corporations is to cut headcount with the remaining teams being stretched very thin. Corporations can instead think of creative ways of retaining headcount. More often than not, colleagues will happily give up bonuses and additional perks if it means keeping the entire team on the payroll.
Dan McConaghy President Fico in Asia Pacific
CORPORATE character is shaped by a company's values. The values we hold in Fico globally and in Singapore are what we consider integral to the business community in Singapore. We believe in a bias for action - having the courage and confidence to make decisions and act swiftly, after consulting multiple perspectives, but without the baggage of 100 per cent consensus. Actions are good, but results are better, so we are driven by success more than process.
We need to cultivate a sense of entrepreneurship, resourcefulness, and initiative within our employees, students and even families to achieve this, and to be able to stay competitive in the global arena. Corporate leaders should hire people smarter than them, and encourage those managers to hire people smarter than them, but only if they fit the company's values. Talented people who buck the values should not be retained as they are detrimental to an organisation's character and morale.
Paul Endacott Managing Director, South East Asia Ambition Singapore
BEING in the recruitment industry where people are a huge part of our business, the one value I would encourage to be an integral part of Singapore would be ''integrity'', because it is the stepping stone towards forging lasting and conducive relationships. Quoting Confucius, ''the strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home''.
The best way for companies to propagate and instil integrity is to practise what they preach. Take for example OCBC Bank, which recently launched a new campaign to help the public redefine the 5Cs in life to go beyond material wealth. Following the campaign, it announced two new schemes to promote work-life balance across its business. This act of integrity to stay true to what it promotes is definitely a great example that OCBC Bank is setting for its staff.
On a more personal and ground level, it simply boils down to treating others how you expect to be treated and similarly, reciprocating accordingly when you are treated with the same level of integrity.
Liu Chunlin CEO K&C Protective Technologies Pte Ltd
TO BECOME a kind and gracious society, in the midst of economic striving, requires the working together of the individual, community and society at large.
Religion in the modern world has become separate from the state in most countries. The inadvertent consequence is a possible sterile focus on economic growth and social stability, without the energising true faith. For it is when people truly respect a God and love their neighbours as themselves, that certain values and behaviour can take place. Even religion itself can become an intolerant system if individuals fail to adopt the true approach.
It is often said that we can only achieve either economic success or a gracious society. I maintain it is possible to achieve both. For example, even in a competitive business world, one needs to keep an eye on the compassionate society, so that success is not hollow but is supported by meaningful personal relationships and a commitment to help the less fortunate. And companies can play a big part by continuing to support corporate social responsibility initiatives and by enshrining gracious society values in their corporate culture.
David Low CEO Futuristic Store Fixtures Pte Ltd
THE ability to display compassion in all ways of life creates a harmonious society. To acquire such faculty requires one to be mindful of diversity in cultures and practices, in beliefs, in outlook. Knowledge is power and it is salient to relay such diversity from young and inculcate in our little ones the ability to understand and be respectful of such. A gracious society starts with a tripartite relationship engaging the individuals, the government and corporations. As a Singaporean, I am proud to know that our fellow citizens have not only contributed to the country through charitable acts, but a handful have also helped to build schools and houses, offered medical assistance and adopted children in Third World countries to combat starvation and meagre living conditions.
Being a developed nation in a developing region, lending a hand to our neighbours is just as important. Giving is not limited to organised events; little ways in showing kindness to people we come into contact with every day goes a long way. As a nation, government initiatives in raising awareness and creating opportunities to drive compassionate acts that involve public participation will help promote gracious living.
On a corporate level, returning to society could form one of the directives for revenue generation. Not only financial contributions but taking time to participate in activities together with the staff aids bonding and thereby greater understanding of every co-worker. In Futuristic, we make it a yearly affair to spend time with our lonely seniors and underprivileged children with movie dates and festive celebrations, apart from charity dinners where we get to share a night with our colleagues over charitable causes. And such corporate philanthropic acts could gradually influence the individuals to do likewise on a personal level. The snowballing effect will only get better.
Karen Flynn MD & Principal Consultant Siren
OVER the past 22 years, I have witnessed first hand the changes in Singapore that govern kindness and key characteristics in a society that change mindset towards each other. Observing different generation groups makes an interesting experiment and it's truly remarkable that the younger group of adults are driving the change in this regard.
The word ''kindness'' means many different things to people - meritocracy, equality, acceptance are all results of a kind and compassionate society once the values are ingrained and part of our core. While older Singaporeans are still somewhat governed by the thought that someone could be in your gratitude if you demonstrate kindness openly and therefore, a loss of face ensues; younger Asians have played a tremendous role in putting forward a different sensibility. Whether helping strangers on the streets looking utterly lost, or picking up after an old person, or paying it forward (a truly Western idea), younger people in our society today have changed mindset in promoting a greater sense of kindness without expecting something in return.
As far as corporates are concerned, and where we can see more in this regard - a sense of greater humanity is possibly the next step. I haven't yet witnessed someone giving their hailed taxi to someone behind them willingly just because they look like they desperately needed it, or a 50-something year old giving up his seat on the MRT to a very tired looking young person. In fact, some prejudices still prevail ... one is reminded on a somewhat regular basis that Singaporeans are governed by the thought that they do not want to make that person ingratiated to them by helping. A testimony to tradition, but in the real world, one that possesses less depth and place in our society today.
If we are to progress and prosper as a society we must rely on each other and show constant acts of kindness - in all our living spaces. When acts of kindness and compassion become second nature and are carried out without a second thought, it's then that we can all pat ourselves on the back and enjoy the beauty of a mature and sophisticated society. When we no longer think of days-off for our foreign worker as an issue, or have to post signs to clear trays from public restaurant tables for others, then and only then we can claim to have moved the needle on this critical gauge.
John Koh Managing Director WMRC Private Ltd
IT IS very heartening to know that we are a nation that is not just preoccupied with economic successes but also concerned about having the right set of values. Not many top cities in the world can boast of that and from the recent news showing that Singaporeans care about values and want to be a kinder society, we know we are not a people superficially motivated by material gains.
Corporate leaders can definitely do their part to inculcate a desirable set of values in our society. Starting from investing more resources and putting more attention on corporate social activities, employees will have a larger vision of the work they do and how their actions contribute to the collective good of the society. We often think of corporations as profit-seeking organisations but if we think deeper, we will realise that beyond economic profits, companies exist to fulfil a specific social cause or purpose. For example, real estate companies exist to build pleasant living environments for their customers and banks exist to help their customers with finances. Understanding our purpose will lead us to develop the right set of values for our society.
Ronald Lee Managing Director PrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd
OUR society could certainly do with more kindness, graciousness and compassion. To cultivate this, we need to go to the root and start incorporating civic education into the school system on a much larger scale so that the next generation grows up with a certain set of values. Parallel to this, I strongly urge our residents to volunteer their time to do charity work, as I believe that seeing how the underprivileged in society live will help to make us more compassionate towards our fellow man.
Corporations can do their part to instil these values within their workforce through corporate social responsibility initiatives that go a step further than donating money. For instance, they can give their staff dedicated time-off to pursue such volunteer activities that are co-ordinated on a company-wide level. Making work-life balance an important tenet in corporate culture may also help employees be less stressed and hopefully, this may translate into them being more gracious towards others.
Patrick Liew CEO HSR Global Limited
MOST definitely, love. Love is one of the most powerful forces in life and a key ingredient to making Singapore a better home. Yet, we have barely scratched the surface to tap this awesome force. Many people have never truly loved or loved enough. They consciously or unconsciously held themselves back from loving others and loving themselves and as a result, they can never live a full life. They also cannot give of their best to the community. In an affluent society, people can become overly focused on acquiring more material wealth and that can have negative outcomes for the country. We need to re-ignite love because it can heal emotional wounds in life and nourish body, soul and spirit. It helps us to be at peace with ourselves and at the same time, it spurs us to improve our lot and be a blessing to people and the environment.
The paradoxical truth is that the more we extend our love to others, the more love we will have and the better we will become in sharing the blessings of love with others. As we live a life of love, we will continue to strengthen our capacity, ability and tenacity to love. The worst heart disease for an entrepreneur is not to have a heart for people. If we do not have a heart to love and serve others, we do not qualify and deserve to be a leader. As corporate captains, we can certainly learn to exemplify love and share it with the people around us. Historically, we went from an agrarian age to the industrial age. From the industrial age, we went into the information age. It's about time we moved into an age of Love.
Steve Melhuish Co-Founder and Group CEO PropertyGuru
SINGAPORE is a wonderful country to live in, not only for my family and I, but also for my business. Singaporeans are an extremely busy and hardworking people. It's easy to get caught up with work and life and I'm guilty of it myself. But I think we can all afford to be a tad more generous with our time, and give a little something back to society. You'll be pleasantly surprised what an act of kindness, no matter how small, can achieve - even if it's not immediately discernible.
My small gesture is encouraging my employees to regularly come up with ideas on how we can, as an organisation, do just that for society, and try to inspire by example. And I'm proud to say we've participated in meaningful activities for a good cause like Hair For Hope. You just have to keep trying, and hope what you do catches on.
Andrea Ross Managing Director (Singapore & Malaysia) Robert Walters Singapore
FOR a multi-cultural society like Singapore, some of the key values I feel are integral for this country and its people would be democracy, mutual respect, compassion, empathy, diversity and honesty. These should be pervasive across all cultures, races and religions - from the government, its country leaders right down to its people. When any employer is looking to hire, a key hiring criterion is whether the individual has strong personal values. Those personal values can range from loyalty to honesty, integrity and trust - which however could be quite difficult to gauge from an interview. An individual's family background can more often than not reveal if someone possesses the key values that you're looking for, and if inculcated earlier in life, is able to be shaped into a highly responsible individual or a future leader. However, in my experience, I have also personally come across individuals who have had a tough upbringing but yet embody very strong positive personal values.
Companies are known to use rewards and recognition effectively to encourage strong values in a workforce and to openly discourage those who do not display the desired values. I do believe that personal values play a significant part in shaping the country's values, as people are what ultimately forms the backbone of every society. At the end of the day, however, a country is duty-bound to represent the right values to its people - as that will impact how we shape our future generations.

","   IT IS significant but no surprise that a sizeable chunk of Singapore's 2013 Budget is devoted to fostering ""a fair and more inclusive"" society. After all, despite a policy focus on the lower-income segments of society in recent years, the income gap continued to widen last year, maintaining a decade-long general uptrend in the Gini coefficient. The measure of income inequality edged up in 2012 from 2011, both when government handouts were included or not.
It may be a worldwide phenomenon, but the risk that income inequality poses to social cohesion ""matters more"" to Singapore as it is ""not just a city but also a nation"", said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in his Budget statement yesterday.
And more than once in his two-hour speech, he spoke of the need to take further and ""major"" steps to temper inequality.
One key plank is to have a more progressive fiscal system, with the taxes and benefits tilted towards the lower and middle-income groups. There's a need to ""redistribute"" and ""preserve a sense of fairness"" in society, even as the government tries to keep the economy competitive, Mr Tharman said.
Here, he didn't tweak the income tax rates - presumably because Singapore's personal income tax structure is already one of the most progressive in the world.
Instead, the government seeks to redistribute via two quintessentially Singaporean big-ticket ""spending"" items: property and cars. Only ""the very top-end"" prime district houses, and investment properties especially, as well as swank fancy cars face hefty tax hikes. In fact, according to the Ministry of Finance, only the top one per cent of homes, and top one-third of investment properties will see higher property tax rates.
Most mass-market buyers will see some tax savings. This may appease some in the sandwiched middle class who often see themselves priced out of the government's fiscal largesse.
The other big move towards a more progressive social system is the enhancement of the Workfare Income Supplement, now extended to those earning up to $1,900 a month.
Another big, and fairly immediate, income boost for Singaporeans, at least those earning up to $4,000 a month, is a new wage credit scheme that has the government co-funding 40 per cent of their wage increases over the next three years.
The move will, hopefully, draw more Singaporeans to take up perfectly good jobs that haven't perhaps been the careers of choice, including driving or waiting on tables. But, in the bigger scheme of things, will the scheme lead to wage inflation, particularly if productivity gains do not keep up?
In the package of measures to build a more inclusive society, however, what's arguably significant for its longer-term reach is the move to boost social mobility by giving children of low and middle-income households a leg-up.
On the need to sustain and strengthen social mobility, a key trait of Singapore society, Mr Tharman said in a telling remark: ""Meritocracy alone will not assure us of this.""
By all accounts, the picture of social mobility in Singapore is a little mixed, even though a good 94 per cent of Singaporeans now have post-secondary education, up from 60 per cent 20 years ago.
Growing income inequality in a more globalised domestic economy has no doubt added to the challenge but it is a matter of concern if meritocracy - a pillar of Singapore society - is no longer sufficient for mobility.
Mr Tharman described the need to sustain social mobility and strengthen support for older Singaporeans as a shift in policy thinking.
He cited other instances, too, where a change in mindset is necessary: businesses need to innovate and ""adjust to the permanent reality of a tight labour market""; and in society at large, ""where we have to accord ordinary workers not just better pay but greater respect"".
With its twin thrusts of steering Singapore away from foreign labour and also towards inclusiveness, the 2013 Budget will go down as a decisive nudge in thinking on both economy and society.

","   Will the recently announced employment-related Budget proposals and other similar measures change employers' hiring processes and strategies, and if so, how? Could the measures be fine-tuned further?
SM Ang, Allen Group Managing Director Aldon Technologies Services Pte Ltd
THE slew of new employment policies has both short-term and long-term repercussions for us and we will definitely change our hiring strategy and the way we recruit skilled and semi-skilled talents.
In the short term, we have to quickly adjust our hiring strategy in response to the drastic reduction of foreign labour on S-Passes and Work Permits. We are exploring local non-traditional source of potential manpower pool that we can tap. Specifically, we are working with relevant organisations to employ physically challenged people to work in administration and production. We believe that by redesigning our processes, these people can fit into our operations.
In the longer term, we have to plan ahead and explore how we can tap the SME Talent Programme. This is an innovative scheme to help SMEs tap students who are studying in the polytechnics and ITEs. This scheme merits greater consideration as it potentially can be a new learning model for our tertiary institutions that marries teaching with hands-on practice in industry as practised in some countries like Germany. At the same time, SMEs hosting these students can develop their talents as well as build strong relationships with them so that after they graduate and after serving their bonds, they will be incentivised to work with the company. It is a win-win arrangement.
Phillip Overmyer Chief Executive Singapore International Chamber of Commerce
AN increasing number of Employment Pass holders are senior executives sent to Singapore to set up and manage the top-end activities of foreign companies. It is crucial for companies entering the Singapore marketplace for the first time, and for companies already here expanding their operations into new higher value areas, to be able to employ talent from their home country and also from around the region in order to use Singapore for their headquarter operations.
While focusing on growing the business, part of the remit of these C-level executives is also to pass on their skills and knowledge to Singaporeans. As the economy restructures and more companies in the new industries that Singapore wants to grow are being set up here, we have to accept that these companies bring in new jobs that have never been done before, thus the need for the companies to bring in their own people with the right skills and expertise.
While SICC understands the need to reduce the number of foreign workers coming into Singapore, the government would have to be discerning in the type of people they allow in and recognise this high value-added group so companies get the right set of people for the jobs they need and also enhance the skills and value of their Singapore staff. In the areas of S-Pass and Work Pass, this is clearly an area that the government is working on to bring people on board.
We support the need to have as many Singaporeans as possible fill up these jobs and we understand the government's concern about companies which hire foreign workers just because they are a cheaper alternative. However, this mid-range group of people are in Singapore today because the jobs and skill sets that companies require are at the point where there are not enough Singaporeans to fill. This may continue to be the case over the next few years as many Singaporeans move up into higher-level jobs.
Annie Yap Managing Director AYP Associates Pte Ltd
THESE measures certainly call for a shift in mindset regarding recruitment practices. Hiring has been based largely on manpower availability and workload, but now quality of candidates is top priority.
Employees will need to exhibit flexibility and carry dual portfolios; otherwise, employers will have to look extensively into cross-training to maximise efficiency. Wages should naturally be raised to match higher-quality workers.
Overall, businesses will likely undertake more stringent hiring procedures. This restructuring is definitely beneficial in the long run. However, we may not recover as quickly should our economy experience any undesirable shifts in the near future. Perhaps more mitigation measures can be in place to anticipate such events.
Philip Yuen Chief Executive Officer Deloitte Singapore
THE employment-related measures in Budget 2013 are expected to significantly impact businesses that employ foreign nationals. The further tightening of immigration criteria and raised levies will drive businesses to review their talent sourcing strategies to achieve growth while keeping operating costs down in current market conditions. Employers may also need to review their compensation and benefit structures under new taxation rules for employer-provided accommodation and cessation of the Equity Remuneration Incentive Scheme. This dual focus will be necessary in order for businesses to attract high-calibre talent and enhance productivity and performance.
Benson Loi Managing Director Trustford Consultants Pte Ltd
WITHOUT doubt the government has made clear that companies need to reduce their dependency on foreign workers. Restricted access to cheap foreign labour increases the need to focus on productivity, not just through automation but also in hiring efficient staff. We expect the selection process to be more stringent as companies strive to get the best value for each hire, with greater emphasis on quality and not just quantity, in order to keep costs down.
Talent management, succession planning and cross training programmes aimed at building a pipeline of local talent will become even more critical so as to reduce the dependency on overseas hires. Existing government incentives such as PIC can be fine-tuned to specifically address this, directing companies to focus more on building local talent and providing career paths for local employees. While such measures aim to balance the local/foreign mix of the workforce, they should not end up as ''protectionist'' tools simply to keep out foreign talent. As a global city, we must be careful not to send out the wrong signals.
The longer-term solution is to cultivate a nimble, versatile and productive local workforce through training which can compete globally. Government incentives should continue to target this.
Michael Smith Director for Singapore Randstad
THE further tightening of foreign workers' quotas will unavoidably influence employers' hiring strategies. Any businesses that aren't already doing so will need to make necessary adjustments to recruit and retain more local talent. For example, adopting flexible working arrangements to gain access to a wider local talent pool, such as mature-age workers and return-to-work mothers, and offering career development and upskill- ing opportunities to attract and retain the right people.
However, even though there are schemes and initiatives to upskill the local talent, it will take some time for some of the industries, such as research and development (R&D), IT and financial services, to be able to source enough talent from the local workforce. It is important that the government sets respective quotas for different industries based on the unique industry situations, so that the businesses in Singapore have sufficient transition time and business operations will not be disrupted.
Sheshashayee Venkatraman CEO Jaya Holdings Limited
I BELIEVE that the government's aspiration for quality growth is commendable. It is important that Singaporeans are given preference and priority in all walks of life. Companies and organisations have to recognise that the business environment is changing and that each of us has to adapt to the concomitant impact on our industry, business and company.
Being in the offshore oilfield services industry, there are some constraints we face which will need to be evaluated and addressed in due course. One, finding people willing to work in the harsh and exacting environment that we work in. Two, our inherent need for minimum physical requirements in terms of youth, agility, eye sight, physical strength, etc, to deal with working in confined spaces, at heights, on precision jobs, with heavy tools and equipment.
Three, the reluctance of insurance companies to provide adequate cover for term life and personal accident to senior employees in the environment in which we work. Four, the increasingly more stringent standards of quality, safety and health that we are required to adhere to. There are solutions, I am sure, and these will need to be identified, evaluated, bought into and implemented. The transition support package is a good initiative, and may need to be tailored for different industries and businesses.
Francis Koh Managing Director Capita Pte Ltd
WE applaud the government's measures to improve the talent acquisition market. In particular, the Wage Credit Scheme is warmly welcomed by many companies as it spurs employers to seek local employees and promote from within. However, companies need to account for such wage increases in the long run, especially factors such as the duration of these subsidies. The reduction of foreign talent quota may affect SMEs and labour-intensive industries such as hospitality and construction. It becomes crucial to pursue productivity improvement which may take substantial time to see results. Companies need to re-invent themselves quickly to adapt to these changes.
Florence Ng Managing Director, Founder Straits Talent Pte Ltd
IT IS clear from the latest Budget measures that all businesses operating in Singapore will have to take a giant step forward in order for the economic restructuring to truly take effect.
Two things spring to mind. Firstly, the tightening of the Employment Pass application criteria will put further strain on the existing local talent pool. Employers will have to try harder to source for local talent before going down the foreign talent route. This brings us back to the finite talent pool in Singapore. We have to be conscious not to shut the door on foreign talent, or the multinationals will start to pull out of Singapore due to the lack of talent to fill key positions. It's a fine line, but when managed well, this tightening policy/exercise will help streamline hiring processes so as to consider local talent first.
Secondly, the wage credit scheme for low wage local workers - may be better off if applied together with a meritocracy approach. Perhaps give wage increments only to those who are deserve it, based on their performance track record. While those at the helm have to embrace and award these wage increments, at the ground level, it is up to each and every employee to lift his game so as to make the wage rise meaningful. Without this increase in output, a mere wage increment does not by itself increase productivity. Slackers will continue to slack - just be paid more for it.
The challenge is about motivating employees so that they see the need to raise their productivity levels in order to earn the pay rise. Surely, if their productivity levels actually do rise, employers would be happy to maintain their revised higher wages when the government subsidy is eventually removed.
Foo Kim Peng CEO Transit Link Pte Ltd
IN THE short term, Budget measures like the Wage Credit System (WCS) will definitely have a substantial positive impact on employers' human resource strategies as they revisit and redesign employees' progressive wage benefits to incentivise and motivate productivity. The short-term benefits of the WCS will definitely help in attracting talent, which is a key challenge commonly faced in our service industry.
However, it is also crucial for employers to consider the long-term impact on sustaining the wage increase after the government support ceases in three years' time. We would encourage policymakers to consider fine-tuning the measures to extend the transitional support package over a longer duration, to enhance employers' confidence to undertake the initiatives in providing and sustaining employees' wage and training benefits, so as to add value to the nation's productive workforce in the long run.
Mark Micallef Area Vice-President, Asean Citrix Systems
THE government's recent employment-related Budget proposals are by far the strongest indication that a radical re-look of the workplace is required for the country to ascend the productivity ladder. These measures are expected to alter the hiring process and strategy as the workforce grows more slowly and gets older.
To harness the best of a mature yet smaller workforce, enterprises should consider technologies and policies that allow employees to be as productive when they are out of the office as when they are in the office - anywhere, anytime and on any device. Technologies such as enterprise mobility management (which includes mobile device, application and data management), cloud computing and desktop virtualisation, give users device choice and the ability to work anytime, anywhere, while also enabling IT to meet its management and compliance requirements.
Unrestrained by the physical constraints of a traditional office, enterprises can be further empowered to drive their operations beyond geographical or time boundaries, expanding their business reach and potential.
Zaheer Merchant Regional Director (Singapore & Europe) QI Group of Companies
THE recent employment-related Budget proposals encourage employers to consider hiring Singaporeans for jobs regardless of industry and sector. This will help equalise the recent TAFEP feedback pointing to proclivity of foreign managers in certain institutions hiring their own country folk. Strategies will change including meeting wage demands which can be gratefully supplemented by the WCS once refined and clarified. Redeployment of existing resources will have to follow, since hiring of foreign workers will become more difficult.
The focus will have to be more holistic with the changes becoming immediately apparent with the government addressing training, working with agencies to nurture young Singaporeans in various sectors, and strengthening government employment facilitation for the unemployed and those hoping to change careers. These will inevitably affect the workforce.
The measures may be too recent to be fine-tuned effectively and strategically. Their sustainability and effect will only realistically be seen over time. As they have yet to be actively implemented, industries can only provide feedback or judge their effect on productivity, based on a straight-line profit perspective.
One key issue will be how employers change tack with the impending vagaries anticipated in the economy.
Patrick Liew CEO HSR Global Limited
THE vast array of goodies in Budget 2013 is designed to send a strong and clear signal.
Industries, enterprises and workers must improve their value-add, productivity and innovation. Enterprises should not be labour-intensive and overly dependent on low-wage and foreign workers. If not, they may eventually have to cease their operations, or relocate all or part of the operations out of Singapore. Employers have to improve their competence in attracting and hiring the best talents for the right jobs. They must learn to not only retain them but also upgrade them on an ongoing basis so as to respond to the fast-changing environment.
To respond to these challenges, they should explore running a corporate university on their own, as a strategic alliance, or in partnership with a business consultancy. This is a strategic tool that is widely leveraged upon by many great companies and is an important part of developed economies.
A corporate university with a relevant hands-on curriculum can help enterprises enhance lifelong learning, knowledge management and change leadership on both organisational and individual levels. It can also help foster a stronger branding, culture, loyalty, and affection for the company.
Perhaps the government can apportion resources to help enterprises launch and tap on this best practice. It can also encourage and empower local universities to provide such services to help SMEs in particular to compete and succeed in the new economy.
Gary Lai Managing Director - SEA Charterhouse Partnership
THE recent employment-related Budget has given us an insight into the government's direction for Singapore's future employment workforce. Companies employing highly skilled overseas talent with technical and international experience would continue to be welcomed and encouraged to base their corporate regional and R&D functions in Singapore. However, industries which are labour-intensive would need to improve their efficiency, or move their operations to lower-cost countries.
The Wage Credit Scheme's objective is not only to improve the salaries of lower-paid Singaporeans, but also gives companies a three-year window to improve their manpower efficiency with the emphasis on nurturing Singaporeans. Companies which currently operate on a low-cost labour-intensive workforce will now need to rethink their operational strategies and some will likely permanently move out of Singapore. However, the Iskandar region in Johor Bahru provides for an alternative solution for companies to move their manufacturing base nearby while yet keeping regional decision-makers in Singapore. The important objective of the Budget is to steer our local manpower resources into higher-value, knowledge-based positions, and to complement the continued flow of skilled foreigners, in order to build Singapore into a leaner, more efficient workforce of the future.
Ronald Lee Managing Director PrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd
THE Wage Credit Scheme (WCS), in which the government subsidises 40 per cent of the wage increases of Singaporean workers, applies to those earning up to a gross monthly pay of $4,000. This includes bonuses and commissions so we may see some restructuring of the pay package offered to new hires.
Given the three-year time-scale for this subsidy, it is likely that employers may prefer to pay more in bonuses instead of hiking basic monthly pay permanently, as there is currently a lot of uncertainty about what will happen after the three years. The question foremost on employers' minds now is how they will cope with the increased labour cost once the subsidy is removed in three years' time.
Another phenomenon that may occur is that employers will have less incentive to hire fresh graduates, as they will not be eligible for WCS in the year of the new hire. Instead, employers may choose to take advantage of the WCS to poach staff, as they will be able to claim the wage credit by just offering to pay the new hire at least $50 more.
This may result in the talent war heating up even further, with financially strong companies standing to gain while those with weaker balance sheets may become less competitive. Graduates, however, need not worry too much as they will still be likely to find jobs considering how the labour market is set to become even tighter.
Perhaps the measures could be fine-tuned further, to plug some of these potential loopholes.
David Low CEO Futuristic Store Fixtures Pte Ltd
IT IS inevitable for companies to make adjustments to their hiring strategies with new measures put in place. This is especially pronounced in industries that have been highly dependent on foreign labour and talent. WCS may help employers to tap into local pool to minimise foreign dependence but we cannot discount limitations in terms of local demand and supply of skillsets and desirables.
In the midst of new policies, rate of raising productivity and implementing automation are two key elements that could possibly make or break a business in the near term. To prevent the overnight or even slow death of some industries, perhaps a tiered policy with industry-specific measures replacing the current blanket measures may sit better with the overall economic transformation.
Failing which, we risk having mass migration of lower-value manufacturing industries to foreign shores, and such moves could likely affect the local employment scene and stunt economic growth, leading to recession in the worst-case scenario.
The momentum of change will benefit companies gearing towards knowledge-driven and service-oriented operation models.
Joshua Yim CEO Achieve Group
WITH the increase in foreign worker levy and dependency ratio ceiling, companies need to hire more Singaporeans and permanent residents. Now with the Wage Credit Scheme, there is a cane and also a gain if companies hire Singaporeans. As the economy continues to expand, there will be fiercer competition for Singaporeans, which are already a hot commodity.
As the head of an employment services firm, my assessment is that we need to take a macro view of what is happening in the economy and juxtapose it against that of advanced economies. In European countries, for instance, you will find that skilled workers like mechanics, chambermaids, security guards and even waiters are paid very well and these jobs are considered respectable, with a certain degree of professionalism attached to them. This is obviously not the case in Singapore and I would like to see the launch of new initiatives that aim to elevate the standing of such jobs that Singaporeans shun.
As a country, if we are going to move towards having these jobs filled by Singaporeans instead of foreigners, there needs to be structural changes to the system, prompted by a great paradigm shift in our beliefs about these types of jobs. We need to copy the model of other mature economies such as Paris, London and New York, and have these currently low-paid, unglamorous jobs repackaged and repositioned with a more professional spin, and with higher pay.
With regard to the employment-related Budget proposals, I believe that there is room for debate, and perhaps the details need to be ironed out so that business owners will understand exactly how the new measures will be implemented. There may be a need for some fine-tuning along the way but it is really too premature to determine these as it is early days yet.
Lim Soon Hock Managing Director Plan-B Icag Pte Ltd
IT IS heartening to note that many of the recently announced employment-related Budget proposals are Singapore employee-centric by design and purpose, and for good reasons too. It is a step in the right direction to enhance our local human capital. We can expect employers to take steps to refine and reshape their hiring processes and strategies to give a greater and stronger focus on hiring local Singaporeans to take advantage of many of these measures and proposals.
All things being equal, employers are now incentivised to hire more Singaporeans. Businesses now cannot get away easily with the hiring of foreign talent, when there is an ample supply of such local talent in areas such as administration, accountancy, sales and marketing, etc.
However, Singaporeans must not take this ''Hire Singaporeans first'' push as a right. The only way for Singaporeans to beat foreigners for the best jobs available is to make sure that we have the requisite skills and knowledge. Both individuals and businesses must continue to invest in training and re-training, taking advantage of some of the proposals that have been announced or enhanced.
This new normal of an employer and employee compact for Singapore will ensure that we will continue to grow economically through investments in human capital to achieve the higher productivity needed to sustain our growth.
David Leong Managing Director PeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd
HIRING patterns will shift towards a more balanced approach since foreign and local labour unit cost is equalising. The levy is a great equalisation policy tool used by MOM to steer considerate and careful use of foreign labour. Adjustment to the dependency ratio limits the number of foreign intake. These twin actions force a re-think on hiring processes and strategies.
With a proactive promotion of productivity and a slew of employment related Budget provisions, grants and supports, companies will re-assess their labour cost equation and sustainability in a low-labour environment. The government's support programmes help alleviate the migration pains from a very different labour model to the current highly competitive and restrictive labour regime.
In view of the labour resource constraints, employers must evolve and adapt to the new temperature. The heat of having not enough manpower is forcing many companies to shift their labour-intensive operations out of Singapore and with an advocacy on higher wages, particularly to Singaporeans, it is causing stress on the bottom lines.
Going forward, Singapore is shifting to a different flavour of growth and the Budget itself defines the target of ''quality growth''. The government's initiatives are all steering towards high productivity growth and such approaches are bitter pills for many employers.
Despite many rounds of negotiations, bargains and pleas by business federations, associations and companies with the authorities, the direction of the lower-labour/higher-productivity drive is unlikely to change. The Budget defined the persistence of MOM's stance on labour. Today's mantra is ''work more with less'', and employers must more or less follow the government's drumbeat to stay in Singapore. It is ''take the heat'' in Singapore or go up north to Iskandar.
Steve Melhuish Co-Founder and Group Chief Executive Officer PropertyGuru
THE focus of any human resource policy, be it with Singapore companies or at government policy level, is not about being dependent on foreign labour and talent, but about finding the best possible skills and talent within Singapore or beyond our shores.
Nurturing local talent should not be incentivised for the aim of replacing foreign labour; rather, it should be encouraged to enhance the level of expertise required from a specific job scope, in order to raise productivity and adapt to the changing demands of the workplace.
If the issue lies in having to curb the number of work and employment passes issued to foreign nationalities to achieve this aim, then companies must ask themselves whether the current pool of foreign workers and employees is producing work equitable to their job scope and salary scale and whether the work output of foreign employees based on their skills-set and productivity levels is on a par with performance expectations.

","   SINGAPOREANS are the happiest people in Asia - if the extent to which they express their euphoria on social media platforms is any indicator of happiness.
This is according to the first Asia Happiness Index, which seeks to determine true levels of happiness in five Asian countries through their multiple social media platforms.
Designed and launched by Eden Strategy Institute to commemorate International Day of Happiness today, the index is powered by a proprietary online social media intelligence tracking engine and covers over 200 million social media accounts.
The five countries are Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and India, in descending order of the people's expressiveness of their happiness.
They were chosen based on factors, such as geographical proximity, level of engagement in social media, and global perception of their country's happiness level.
Singapore emerged tops despite public dissatisfaction with issues such as the rising cost of living. Most Singaporeans appear to endorse the Singaporean dream of self-actualisation, meritocracy, safety and efficiency in society, and seem particularly expressive during festive periods and special occasions, according to Eden Strategy Institute.
In contrast, Gallup's survey of 148 countries conducted in 2011 had listed Singapore as the country least likely to report having positive emotions.
Instead of using self-reporting methods which can give rise to inaccuracy, the index was based on the latest scientific research into happiness, which offers a set of ""markers"" that lead to social and individual well-being.
These include factors, such as strong and frequent social ties, good health, and a sense of purpose through meaningful work.
Each ""happiness marker"" was further defined with a full range of descriptive lexicons, in English as well as languages relevant to the countries concerned.
Automated Sentiment Response algorithms were used to pick up each term from a gamut of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, before performing counts of each term.
Semantic logic was then used to calibrate the counts to account for nuances, such as language differences, cultural skews, and sarcasm.
Finally, total counts per country were rebased against the social media population in each country, obtained from sources such as Social Bakers and Semiocast, to allow a fair representation of each country despite differing levels of social media penetration.
Said Calvin Chu, partner at Eden: ""This is the first and only regional Happiness Index that covers over 200 million online accounts across Asia and taps into people engaging with each other in their natural states.
""We were surprised by some of the results, which reveal the national psyche of these countries and will be of strong interest to citizens, policymakers, and businesses alike.""

","   A knowledge of both govt policy and concerns of the private sector has made David Chin a valued strategist in Singapore's development as a maritime centre, reports LYNN KAN
DAVID Chin, now 68, should be settling into a regular timetable of golf and grandfathering, but has chosen to remain intensely plugged-in to the first industry he chose - shipping and the high seas.
Mr Chin has been behind the scenes promoting both the public and private sectors of Singapore's maritime industry. And he is now on the third leg of his voyage, as executive director of the Singapore Maritime Foundation (SMF), a go-between body mediating both public and private sector interests, charged with driving initiatives that will let Singapore excel beyond its origins as a ""physical"" shipping centre.
The SMF has spearheaded the Singapore Ship Sale Form, a document to facilitate the sale and purchase of second-hand vessels; built up the Singapore Maritime Arbitration Centre; and started scholarships to lure young Singaporeans to join the mix of port activities, ship yards, ship-owners, managers, brokers, insurers and lawyers.
Part of Mr Chin's relentless stamina comes from witnessing how tenaciously London held onto its title as the maritime crossroads of the world.
""When I went to London to study, London was the centre of shipbuilding and the Port of London was one of the biggest in the world,"" Mr Chin recalls. ""The Port of London is gone now. They didn't go into containerisation so their King Edward docks and docks in East London have now become housing estates. Hardly any ships are built in London anymore.
""Why (shipping in) London still survives is because the soft part of shipping - insurance, banking, ship financing, arbitration - is still going strong. We saw that, and we realised that we have concentrated and left Singapore alone to be just a port and a shipyard. Over time, they would have gone - like London. So we had to develop shipping services.""
So far, he says, no other aspirants have yet managed to emulate Singapore's trinity of government, private sector, and association that have pushed it to rival London and Oslo as International Maritime Centres (IMCs).
""I hope we never break this humpty dumpty, and we never have to put humpty dumpty together again. It can't be developed overnight. It's a combination of trust in the government - no corruption, meritocracy where everyone gets a fair crack of the whip, which make people willing to contribute, willing to evolve the system,"" he points out. ""Companies have to know that you won't turn around and take advantage of them and come up with policies that negate what they had asked for.""
Mr Chin received the Singapore International Maritime Award for his individual contribution to Singapore's maritime development.
Throughout his career, Mr Chin has managed to be the man at hand at the right moment.
Desiring to see the world, the arts student was unafraid to venture into the technical world of engineering and began as an apprentice at Keppel Shipyard, before studying marine engineering at Newcastle.
When he returned to newly independent Singapore, times had changed. Singaporeans were determined to take over from English managers of commerce and Mr Chin was asked to move to take care of billings at Keppel Shipyard by Chua Chor Teck, himself the first local to become managing director of Keppel Shipyard.
Mr Chin's engineering background turned out to be invaluable in billings. ""I knew exactly how to defend how much we were charging,"" he says.
When Singapore began to shift away from being a factory to the world to being a service-exports centre, Mr Chin, then a marketing manager, went on trade missions with the Trade Development Board (TDB), the sole ""services"" representative of Singapore trying to promote Keppel Shipyard's engineering edge.
Eventually, he was asked to oversee Singapore's development as a commercial shipping capital as a director at the TDB.
Some marine engineers shun commercial work or paper-pushing, but Mr Chin relished the exposure to an entire new facet of commercial shipping which as a shipyard man he never saw.
Thankfully, he picked things up quickly.
Quick thinking, he reckons, is a trait that all marine engineers, naval architects and shipping men have in spades, and one of the reasons why they are much more highly paid than other classes of engineers.
""When you're out in the middle of the sea, you can't call an agent to fix the engine - you fix it yourself, or else the ship will drift into danger,"" he explains. ""Marine engineers are trained to be more practical, more quick-thinking, more innovative and more adaptive - and so we command higher salaries. Not many can replace us if you haven't gone through the ranks.""
Mr Chin's gift of the gab also served him well when he was working on the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GAAT) negotiations on behalf of Singapore at the World Trade Organization in Geneva in the 1980s.
In the pre-Internet era, Mr Chin was roped in to liaise between the TDB and Singapore's enterprises, flying back and forth between Singapore and Geneva and communicating constantly through faxes and telexes.
Being the go-between, however, gave him a bird's eye view of the issues and interests of different groups.
The unique vantage point was perhaps why he was named director of trade policies at the Ministry of Trade, although he was not an economist by training.
While he protested his lack of grounding in economics, the minister in charge quelled his fears by recommending two books - Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, and Economics authored by economist Paul Samuelson - that he needed for his job.
The intimate knowledge of both government policy and the concerns of the private sector, both engineering and commerce, has made Mr Chin a valued strategist in Singapore's development as a maritime centre. And so it is with more than a modicum of certainty that he says that Singapore's maritime cluster is not a sunset industry, a remark passed by former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew that many have said led to Singapore losing an entire generation of local shipyard men and seafarers.
""There are opportunities for those in their 40s. They're all given opportunities earlier than they would have been,"" he says, explaining that people like himself need to be replaced. ""The generation that comes after them will have to mark their time, but because the industry is still growing, there are many opportunities.""

","   I USED to liken citizenships to country club memberships.
You could think of them as fair transactions. In a way, we pay taxes in exchange for social services, just as country club members foot subscription fees for the upkeep of shared facilities. And while those of us who were born in Singapore are exempted from ""entrance fees"", credible investors with proven finances have every right to apply for permanent residence, and one day become citizens just like us.
Taking this thought further - that citizenship is like paid membership with measurable returns - a question that I frequently asked myself was: What would I do if the costs of this lifelong deal outweighed the yields one day? Would I leave Singapore for good?
It was difficult to arrive at a conclusion. This is home, after all, and controversial changes have only just begun. Yet, the answer always seemed clear when the analogy of a country club came back to mind.
If the majority - who could wield their votes to manipulate or replace a club's management council if they wished - manage to push through by-law amendments that affect our progressive subscription fees, disallow ownership of more than one private buggy or ruin my children's chances of being in the coolest playroom, I would leave, without a doubt.
What gives the people who increasingly demand more of others and their resources this insatiable sense of entitlement? If others had achieved and attained through their own merits, then why should their hard-earned pie be split?
There would simply be no reason to live with that. It just would not be fair, I thought.
Then again, would that really be unfair?
This contrasting notion has been stuck in my mind since a fortnight ago, when Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong told a homecoming at Raffles Institution that elitism must not be bred. The point he made was age-old, but I saw it in a new light for the first time; it struck me as a start to the answer I had been seeking.
""It is not surprising that many who have not done so well see meritocracy as a system that is biased towards those with better resources, and one which impairs their social mobility,"" he said.
I realised then that the root cause of my prior disillusion was a subconscious refusal to admit that I have indeed been fortunate to get to where I am today. Birth and circumstance have given me the privilege - which I did not earn - to be on the right side of social immobility. Above all, I was guilty of harbouring the belief that all ""winners of meritocracy"" are inherently superior and entitled to success.
There and then, it hit me between the eyes that I had attributed to others a wrongful sense of entitlement based on an equally baseless sense of entitlement myself. I was just a pot calling the kettle black.
And it's not as though I'm in a position to do so either - because there are successful Singaporeans out there who really care.
I recall an assignment at the Enterprise 50 Association's annual dinner in early July, when an entire hour of open dialogue with Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong ended up being focused on how the Republic can remain a ""land of opportunities"" for the young, and how society can continue to be pro-Singapore even as it strives for various causes and beliefs.
Awe and shame
Coming from 100 business leaders - neither in political office nor the public service - who have each arrived in their own right, that common commitment to stay involved and face up to our uncertain future left me in awe and shame.
Perhaps it was unbecoming of me to have never treasured the intangible worth of my citizenship all this while; perhaps it was cowardly of me to assume that forsaking Singapore would be the answer to all doubts.
In the first place, the question should never have been whether to leave the Republic for good. Rather, it should have been: What can I do to better understand where other groups of Singaporeans are coming from? How can I fulfil my responsibility to return the favour that society did for me to do well as I grew up?
Still, change is never easy. So while a watershed in our politics is not imminent, it would also be too much to ask of me to immediately be able to toe the line and to accept more legislated giving wholeheartedly.
But as our nation comes to a critical crossroads, I am committed to being more open-minded towards societal views, to put myself in others' shoes before jumping to conclusions, and to bravely embrace Singapore's unforeseeable future.
As my departure from the newsroom and the nation draws near, this sudden resolution may have come a little too late. But as they always say, it's better late than never - especially since I will be back where I know I belong.The writer is a BT intern who will read law at The University of Warwick from next month

","   THE National Day Rally speech delivered on Sunday by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong provided a mixture of immediate and long-term solutions to socio-economic concerns in Singapore. Some of the more pressing issues the speech dealt with - housing, healthcare and education, specifically - were concerns that surfaced during the Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) process.
The measures were swift and bold even if, in some cases, they required only small tweaks to the existing system. Expanding the Medishield scheme, for instance, is as good as implementing a national health insurance scheme, while the additional grants for low-income and middle-income home buyers help to ensure that all working Singaporeans will be able to afford a home.
In education, the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) system required just a tweak so that more holistic elements can be introduced. Changes to the secondary school posting system, meanwhile, may help to create a level playing field for younger Singaporeans so that the perceived top schools are not monopolised by a select group.
While these changes may signal fresh policy-thinking, the government has, in actuality, not lost sight of the core principles that have become the hallmark of the Singapore society. The changes to the secondary school posting system, for instance, serves to strengthen, and not dilute, the core principle of meritocracy that Singapore has been built on. Enhancements to the housing system reinforces the principle that Singaporeans will have access to affordable public housing - a purpose the HDB was originally created to serve, while the expanded medical care seeks to ensure that the elderly and less healthy are taken care of. If anything, it is important that society does not lose its competitive edge and become complacent.
The long-term plans announced in the speech should be commended, even if the benefits may not immediately seem obvious to some. There are few governments that engage in such long-term planning as Singapore's and it is arguably one of the core traits that gives the city-state a competitive edge in the international system.
With external global economic pressures increasing, Singapore may find the need to periodically review, renew and rejuvenate its economy to remain relevant and economically dynamic. Infrastructure projects, such as those announced by the Prime Minister, help to do this by increasing supply in the economy, freeing up bottle-necks, bringing in investments and creating jobs.
Implementation, though, is key. One of the biggest challenges acknowledged by Mr Lee in the Mandarin portion of his speech was the tightening of the workforce, particularly with regard to reducing the inflow of foreign manpower. With a slew of infrastructure projects in the pipeline, there must be enough labour to help build and develop these plans.

HAVING been a dialysis patient for the last 14 years, it saddens me to see many cases of needy patients not obtaining optimal treatment for their kidney failure, simply because they are not covered by medical insurance and cannot afford the high medical costs of regular dialysis and medication.
As such, the new MediShield Life for universal coverage certainly strikes me as the most important. Unlike those offered by private commercial companies, MediShield Life serves to genuinely help those who need it most, and does not discriminate against the elderly or those with pre-existing illnesses.
Singaporeans who suffer from chronic illnesses and who do not enjoy existing coverage will certainly be very thankful to the Singapore government for this policy change.
Tan Chong Huat

THE key message to me was a willing and able government that is taking charge of the issues affecting Singaporeans, and one which wants to stay in power and win subsequent elections. This augurs well for Singapore.
The most urgent policy change to me is the overall strategic shift in providing for Singaporeans who are in need and taking steps to ensure an inclusive society. A government of the people for the people is the PAP government I have come to know. With professed egalitarianism and compassion, the next phase of nation-building may have just begun.

FROM a business and investment standpoint, the long-term plans outlined by Prime Minister Lee to retain Singapore's edge as a global port and aviation hub are viewed positively as it demonstrates the government's commitment and vision for the future.
Singapore's strengths lie in its unparalleled connectivity to Asia and the rest of the world, and it is particularly well placed as a ''Global-Asia hub''. Plans to double capacity of the airport and build a new port hub are major milestones requiring significant investments, which we believe will maintain Singapore's competitiveness and attractiveness to businesses and investors looking to grow in the region.

THE changes to our healthcare system address the evolving needs of all strata of society, particularly the elderly, those with pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, and the under-served segments of the population. MediShield Life has attracted the most attention because of concerns over rising healthcare costs across all life stages. However, it is the changes to the Medisave outpatient policy that will have the most impact in the short to medium term by lessening the financial burden of those in the ''sandwiched class''.
Our College welcomes the revised policies which effectively tackle healthcare challenges for Singaporeans.
Yeoh Oon Jin
Executive Chairman
PwC Singapore
THE Prime Minister's message was on three vital areas (housing, healthcare and education) that affect all Singaporeans. Our government is to be applauded for not only opening avenues for conversations but reacting swiftly with constructive changes. The initiatives in each of these are key to providing better access to three basic necessities. On this basis I cannot rank which part of PM Lee's message I prefer.
Notably, in the area of housing, it is encouraging to see that help will be provided to the lower and middle-income families to support their upgrading to larger units where possible, making three and four-bedroom flats more affordable. It is also good that the suggested policy changes are not expected to affect the resale market, as this would help with the preservation of current property values.
With regard to healthcare, it is timely to consider the options of expanding Medishield coverage, extending CHAS to everyone in low-income households and exploring the possibility of allowing Medisave to be used for outpatient treatments in a bid to address concerns of rising healthcare costs. However, while Medishield Life is expected to benefit everyone universally (regardless of age, health or economic status), it is important to ensure that the new scheme provides for wider coverage with affordable premiums, particularly for those who will not qualify for any subsidy, or else it could create a difficult environment for the average Singaporean - more so if their individual taxes are raised in future under an inflationary environment.
While sceptics will say the proof of this pudding is in the execution, I believe more conversations as a nation will also help to tweak the multitude of changes from this National Day Rally and maybe more. My favourite line from the PM is his repeated request for us to ''have faith''.
Tan Hak Leh

THE Prime Minister's speech at the National Day Rally 2013 was well-balanced, taking a long-term perspective to address national issues of an ageing population and increasing cost of healthcare globally, while responding directly to real everyday concerns of Singaporeans on the issues of housing, healthcare and education. Announcements on initiatives in healthcare are of great importance, given their immediate and future implications for members of the community.
AIA Singapore supports efforts to bridge the under-insurance gap among families and we are aligned with the government's approach of investing in the health of our nation. In all, we are encouraged by the numerous efforts which will strengthen the family unit, and AIA Singapore will continue to work in close collaboration with the authorities to achieve this.

WE applaud the Prime Minister on his bold vision to sustain Singapore's growth and ensure it remains a vibrant hub in South-east Asia. The long-term strategies laid out for development across key sectors will help instil further confidence in Singapore's future among the business community.
As we anticipate growth in the travel industry over the next few years, developments in infrastructure _ particularly the upgrades currently underway at Changi Airport, such as the Project Jewel and the opening of additional terminals _ will play an important role in strengthening Singapore's position as a destination of choice for both business and leisure travellers.

''THE government is listening to the people, and not just listening but also trying to do something about the issues that are of utmost concern to Singaporeans.'' This is what I thought after listening to PM Lee's National Day Rally speech. I was especially heartened by the revamps in MediShield to include the elderly and those with pre-existing illnesses because really, considering their age, increased health risk due to medical history and increasing medical costs, they are the ones who need such a safety net the most.
This is especially good news for those who cannot afford to take out private health insurance for themselves or their loved ones. The inclusion will help alleviate considerable financial burden off their caregivers, and give both insured and their families peace of mind knowing that there is MediShield to fall back on should the insured require any expensive medical treatments.
I only wish that the extra premiums imposed on them will also be reasonable and minimal, else it will be meaningless and will defeat the whole purpose of the scheme.
Florence Ng

Straits Talent Pte Ltd
IT is heartening to see that the government has taken on board feedback from the ground through the year-long National Conversation. The plans for long-term infrastructure improvement (relocation of the Paya Lebar airbase and the container port operations) so as to free up more usable land for future development is an excellent one, and will go a long way to ensure our competitiveness amid an ever-evolving global economy. The forthcoming changes to our education system are also a move in the right direction. This is two-fold: it reinforces our meritocracy model as well as the development of our future generation to prepare them for the challenges ahead.
I applaud the move to tweak the P1 registration system to ensure a more even distribution of student profiles across our school network. This will motivate greater parent and community volunteerism. The shift towards a more holistic performance appraisal of children is also welcome, and is especially important in our drive towards character building and cultivating a more caring community and nation. All in all, an excellent road-map for the way forward.

I WAS excited over the various strategic moves and initiatives announced by the PM in his National Day Rally speech. Bold ideas on infrastructure, public housing, healthcare and education were presented. I agree that collective efforts from all sectors would be required to ensure the success of these plans.
The plan envisioned by the PM is for the future of our nation to stay strong and relevant with the changes and developments coming ahead of us. The many policy shifts will benefit a lot of people in the community, whether it is in healthcare, education or public housing. As a company providing educational services to children and families, we feel that new initiatives and policies in education will be most impactful and relevant to many people. They reflect the government's acceptance of feedback and views on this topic through the OSC with reasonable steps taken to ensure some ''blocks'' are removed.
I also applaud the announcement of more childcare centres for young children to support the many young families in Singapore. As an organisation, our company will endeavour to support these initiatives.
Michael DiGeorge

ARINC Asia Pacific Division
BEING an aviation technology and solutions provider, ARINC is most excited about the expansion plans for Changi Airport. With passenger figures rising, we see airports in the region investing to keep up by equipping themselves with the right technology and building new terminals. Airports face a variety of challenges, including managing the increasing cost of infrastructure and processing large volumes of passengers efficiently. To resolve these, airports are looking for other sources of revenue. Changi Airport, already one of the world's best, is rightfully on track to becoming the ''airport of the future'' and retaining its position as a key aviation hub in the region. The unveiling of ''Project Jewel'' underpins the evolvement of airports into ''aeropolises''.
In time to come, revenue from these ''aeropolises'' would undoubtedly contribute a substantial amount to a country's economy. More importantly, this represents a radical transformation of the passenger experience at the airport, making it enjoyable, fast and seamless. The airport of the future, then, truly becomes an area in which one can live, work and play.

THE message that Singapore must be future-ready was clear and present. It is imperative that we anchor our position in a globalised economy while building an inclusive country that brings out the best in our people without leaving anyone behind.
We need courage and foresight to change and seize opportunities, and a collective faith that the risks and pain that the current generation bears will reap a better world that future generations deserve. And most importantly, every Singaporean individual, in their own way, should and must be a steward of our collective future. Corporates can contribute too, and it is this belief in our role that we at EY have ''Building a better working world'' as our new organisational purpose.
Seah Kian Peng

THE Prime Minister's National Day Rally outlined the strategic shift in our approach towards nation building, aligning the efforts of the individual, the community and the government. It is an encouraging message that is underpinned by the themes of determination to overcome adversities to succeed in life and dedication in giving back to society to enhance our lives and those of our next generation.
More importantly, PM's speech puts together in a big picture what the government has been trying to do in various smaller steps: fix the current capacity crunch, while planning and implementing changes for the long term; and all with the big picture in mind. This is not an easy feat because there is always the pressure to take care of the short term, the squeaky wheel, while leaving the longer-term problems for the next generation. But PM and this government are not like that.
And this is the one major impression that has remained from this rally _ true, there is an increase in social spending, and the government is providing more welfare, but there is also some market and financial discipline. All these additional benefits must ultimately be paid for, and I am glad that the PM did not shy away from making these hard announcements. As PM said, long-term planning is an ''act of faith'', based on a belief that we will be here for the long term. And the only way we can do this, is to continue to make the right choices, no matter how hard they are.

I AM heartened that PM Lee has given the clear direction and assurance that BTO prices will not only remain affordable for generations to come, but that it will also remain an asset class for Singaporeans to benefit from in the long term.
This is despite the many suggestions during the OSC about tweaking the policies such as lowering lease period, selling back to HDB, increasing the MOP and reducing the prices of HDB properties, etc.
PM Lee's new housing policies have already benefited many, as highlighted at the rally that even the bottom 20 per cent of home-owners can be equity-rich by up to $200,000 when they sell their HDB properties.
The wider provision of subsidies will also certainly benefit many who need them at the entry level, as it will allow everyone an opportunity towards home ownership.
Lim Soon Hock
Managing Director
Plan-B Icag Pte Ltd
THE key message from PM is clear: the government is not only listening but is taking concrete action to tackle many of the long-standing problems raised by our citizenry in relation to healthcare, housing and education. The government wants to strike out a new social compact with our citizenry, but everyone must play his or her part in the new Singapore, going forward.
The policy shift in healthcare as outlined by PM Lee, in particular Medishield Life, to cover everyone irrespective of age or health condition, is most important and urgent, given our ageing population. In relation to this, to keep premiums affordable, the government will have to introduce other intiatives, such as telehealth services, in the new continuum of healthcare, from acute care in hospitals to stepped-down care in community hospitals to home care. There is definitely a role which telehealth services can play in triage management and chronic disease management to right site healthcare, through greater personal ownership, and as a consequence to keep healthcare costs as low and as affordable as possible.

Trend Micro Singapore
SINGAPORE has always lived up to the values of a forward-thinking nation, growing from strength to strength over the years. As a top financial and business district and a regional base for many companies, our people are expected to lead by example. While we excel in academics, it takes a different set of skills to instil a culture of entrepreneurship and leadership _ a process which takes time to cultivate and is nurtured from a young age. The Prime Minister's proposal to broaden the Direct School Admissions categories to admit those with qualities like character, drive and leadership into top schools is an important step in ensuring that the country nurtures the right talent.
Through the recognition of various strengths and the holistic nurturing of our youth today, I believe Singapore would take a greater leap forward in building a community and work environment that fosters good leadership skills.

THE annual National Day Rally often serves as a reminder of Singapore's constant efforts towards progression, to which most Singaporeans anticipate the upcoming plans and projections for the country. Always a topic of popular debate, the promise of enabling every working Singaporean to own a home is one of the most significant key messages. The affordability of housing is of top concern and the implementation of such policies is likely to impact and improve the standards of living.
The future plans for Changi Airport's Terminals 4 and 5 also promise a lot of prospects and opportunities for the coming generations of working professionals in Singapore. This will create jobs across business functions and continue to uphold Changi Airport's global award-winning brand name.
Christophe Duchatellier

THE government's stance on creating new jobs within the aviation and services sector, through the development of two new terminals, clearly indicates the strong interest it has in ensuring the stability and security of Singaporeans. As much as we can expect new job creation within the aviation-related areas, we urge job-seekers to constantly look towards upgrading and upskilling themselves to remain relevant in this competitive and challenging landscape.
Clearly, the government has taken positive steps in ensuring social and economic growth, through the various healthcare and education policies, allowing for Singaporeans to look forward to a better future.
Brad Gray

THE focus on education in this year's National Day Rally was encouraging, with policy changes in the form of a revamped PSLE system and flexible learning environments highlighting how learning no longer needs to be confined within a classroom environment. Technological advances have made cross-country knowledge sharing and other unconventional learning platforms possible, thus defying the traditional boundaries of education.
Policy changes in healthcare acknowledge the need to cater to Singapore's ageing population. Initiatives should be put in place to enhance access to healthcare facilities and improve existing systems. Investments in communications infrastructure can facilitate services such as video-consultations from home, thus reducing the need for the elderly to travel and simplifying access to healthcare. Similarly, flexible working policies can be adopted to develop an elderly-friendly working environment. These allow the older workforce to continue offering their expertise using technology that allows them to work from any convenient location.
Dhirendra Shantilal
Board Director & Head, Asia Pacific
Fircroft
IT was a heartfelt speech. I am especially encouraged by PM Lee's proposal to fine-tune our education system into one that instils a genuine love for learning in students, instead of focusing only on examination performance. I believe that opportunities should be provided for every child to excel to his or her own ability, and at the child's own pace.
This holistic educational approach demonstrates the Singapore government's commitment to invest in each individual, and creates a more diverse, versatile and flexible workforce that is also more competitive globally. Part of a more holistic education is to better prepare tertiary-level students for the working world through greater participation in internships.
Another important area is healthcare, especially the revamping of MediShield with MediShield Life, which would benefit many elderly residents. While the government is cognisant of not overburdening future generations with higher healthcare premiums, taking care of our elderly is at the core of many Asian traditions, and reflects the values we hold dear as a society.

IT is comforting to know that the government is going to do its best to help SMEs cope with the tightened foreign worker supply. The PM's speech has also provided a clear direction about not being over-reliant on foreign labour, by managing its demand while not stopping the inflow of foreign workers into Singapore.
Foreign workers will continue to be essential contributors to Singapore's economic development. For jobs that are not palatable to Singaporeans, foreign workers are a lifeline. As they are for almost all of our corporate clients, who house their foreign workers in our accommodation facilities.

IT is encouraging to see the Singapore government's initiatives in addressing the country and society's changing needs. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally address highlights the government's commitment to developing well-thought-out, long-term policies and initiatives that cover both the social and corporate sectors.
The new infrastructural developments at the airport, in particular, will strengthen Singapore's position as a key gateway to Asia. Singapore's government has effectively leveraged on Singapore's airport as the first touch-point for tourists and business visitors.
To continue to build loyalty with first-class business, travel and lifestyle experiences and at the same time reduce operational costs, the government needs to ensure that they have the right technological solutions in place as they build new terminals and facilities at Changi airport. With the growing consumer preference for mobile, paperless communications, mobile technologies will play an integral role in delivering personalised services, such as mobile check-in, mobile ticketing and mobile notifications, in order to address the efficiencies in managing the increasing passenger traffic.
Anton Ravindran

IN his National Day Rally address in Mandarin, PM spoke about the labour crunch. One of the issues which need attention today is the rising cost of operating a business in Singapore and the lack of manpower resources because of the recent foreign talent/worker policies effected by the Ministry of Manpower in recent times. Homegrown businesses and SMEs are facing increasing challenges in recruiting and retaining manpower and some have folded as a consequence in recent times. This ultimately means loss of jobs for Singaporeans who in turn will compete with other Singaporeans for existing jobs.
Besides, the new global economy which competes for global talent (which is primarily the key asset of any enterprise) must create an environment which is conducive to enable enterprises to sustain existing business, create new businesses, and to scale and become regional and global enterprises. This would create more and even better jobs. If the issue is about foreign worker/skills depressing the income levels of Singaporeans and/or contributing to the increasing stress on national infrastructure such as public housing and transport, some form of levy, surcharge or tax could be levied on such foreign talent. Such additional tax should not be an issue for them as Singapore has one of the lowest tax regimes globally which the foreign talent can benefit from. Such collection could be used to build additional housing and transport infrastructure to support the increase in population.
Trying to keep the pie at the same size will not yield bigger or even better slices. The only way forward is to enlarge the pie by adding talent. We cannot grow by nurturing only selected enterprises. Encouraging more to venture and to set up more enterprises of their own (which will become bigger and global) would create better jobs for Singaporeans.

IT was most affirming to see that the nation has embarked on forging a new social compact, between the government and its people, and between businesses and individuals. As a result of these shifts in society, we will continue to see the transformation of our economy hasten into one that will be led by high-value services, and managed by a more productive workforce which will comprise Singaporeans at its core.
In his National Day Rally speech, the Prime Minister reminded us of the wisdom of Dr Goh Keng Swee, who cautioned Singaporeans against taking liberties with past successes, but to build on them and scale greater heights. Enriching the robust foundations of Singapore's successes as an aviation, maritime and financial hub, the government has also identified the prospect of transforming Singapore into a broadcasting and media hub for the world. In my opinion, the country's strengths in the rule of law, respect for intellectual property, budding talent base, and concentration of corporate headquarters place Singapore in a unique position to become the world's digital media valley, where superior content is created and produced and where digital media is developed and managed.
Encompass believes in the potential of this transformation and will continue to partner with the government and businesses to realise this aspiration. Beyond expanding our 88,000 square feet facility, we plan to invest $15 million to $20 million in Singapore over the next five years, as we keep up the momentum of attracting leading broadcasters from around the world to the country, so as to make Singapore a genuine hub of excellence and activity.

Clarity Group
PRIME Minister Lee's speech was by far the most decisive demonstration of the changing face of Singapore. In the course of Clarity's 35-year history, the company has seen the city's landscape evolve from one where godowns and shophouses would skirt the Singapore River, to a skyline that now rivals some of world's leading commercial capitals. This year's National Day Rally addressed the next step of our transformation, which signalled a shift in focus from the hardware to the heartware of the nation, and how together, we may realise our collective aspiration.
IT was also reassuring to note that the Prime Minister commenced his speech about Singapore's next wave of economic transformation by recognising some key advances in technology _ such as the use of robotics _ that were developed, and are already making a difference in Singapore. As a business which has always harnessed technology as an enabler for people to enjoy a higher quality of life, Clarity is looking forward to being able to play its part in helping Singapore realise its vision for a new Changi Airport, and a milieu of new developments in the Marina Bay area that is currently home to the world's busiest shipping port. The next-generation development _ whether commercial or residential _ will be a smarter one that will yield greater premiums for their owners with more efficient monitoring and use of energy and facilities.
In homes today, we have developed solutions for families to be able to control and manage household services such as cooling, lighting, blinds, security, and data throughout the apartment via their tablet or smart devices intuitively. Lights, air-conditioning and environmental control can work together autonomously. For instance, having set a preferred temperature for a designated space, our smart systems will be able to calibrate air-conditioning while intelligently calculate and react to any heat permeating the room with photovoltaic windows that tint automatically. With less heat, air-conditioning units need not work so hard, which results in massive energy savings. In homes of the future, we envisage these same residential facilities to take intelligent action as a result of learnt preferences of its owner, from security to entertainment experiences. Imagine the possibilities of applying these advances to next-generation projects like Project Jewel and the new airport terminals, as we nurture a more productive workforce to harness these technologies to deliver on an enhanced service experience. The next step forward is indeed going to be an exciting one!

THERE are three main concerns _ housing affordability, medical expenses and education _ which are equally important and urgent to different segments of population. From the National Day Rally, PM has demonstrated that the government will fundamentally address these concerns and from there, pave the way to accommodate the population increase. For the younger generation, who are too intimidated by the housing cost and competitive educational system to have children, the government will be enhancing the housing grants. This will relieve the burden of owning a house. Besides that, the change in PSLE scoring system will be beneficial in alleviating the stress.
The next segment will be the senior citizens, who are concerned about the affordability of healthcare due to lack of insurance coverage. Hence, introducing mandatory lifetime coverage for MediShield will be a great and timely move for all Singaporeans. In addition, the relocation of Paya Lebar Air Base and Tanjong Pagar port will help to provide more space for the increasing population. All these paint a positive future for Singapore.

THIS year's National Day Rally saw the Prime Minister outlining the nation blueprint for advancement in the next 20 years. My key takeaway is the government's strategies to keep the country sustainably competitive in the global world by instilling faith in our people and confidence in investors. These ''acts of faith'' will create political stability which is fundamental to support the blueprint. With progressive development plans in infrastructure and basic needs of housing, healthcare and education addressed in alignment to standards of a developed nation, we should see healthy economic growth of 1-3 per cent which reinforces stability in the long run.
For the blueprint to take off, the utmost important directive would be to address the needs of the lower tier ensuring a secured safety net comprising affordable housing, promised education and medical coverage. This comes with a high cost and of equal importance would be the calibration of our budget allocation. End of the day, it helps to narrow the gap between the rich and less privileged through working on the fundamentals instead of pure populist-driven policies.
Liu Chunlin

THE government has changed the way of thinking in managing the country by taking real actions: putting in effort through ''Our Singapore Conversation'' initiative in order to understand better the needs and wants of our people, and subsequently combining these findings with the best interest of our country. As a result, the policy changes in subsidy for home purchases and healthcare (including Medisave and MediShield) are very impressive and well-planned.
There is also good news for the economy as the government has committed more spending on infrastructure like new port hub at Tuas, Changi Airport Terminal 5 and Jewel at Terminal 1. As a homegrown company that provides security and protective solutions, our company is ready to accept and welcome these great business opportunities to be involved in these future developments. The Jewel Project at Changi Airport is going to be a wonderful experience, one similar to that offered by the Gardens by the Bay, for both the local as well as the foreign visitors.
The policy changes are providing the seeds for a better future for our next generations, just like what our forefathers had done for this generation: laying down a solid foundation for the country. In addition, the new developments will create new jobs for at least the next 30 years.

PM's 2013 National Day Rally speech is really the drawing of a vision with concrete action plans. A year-long Singapore Conversation has culminated in real action on education, healthcare and housing which directly impact on lives.
Education is featured strongly in the rally. His imagery of a range of peaks and many paths to achievements and to the top of the peaks is a great way to express the education vision. The landscape is not about one mountain or Mount Singapura but a range like the Himalayas each with a visibility on its own highland, each with its own stratosphere. To each his own to achieve and the government will provide the access through the different elevations _ primary, secondary, ITE, polytechnics and universities. Elitism and exclusivity of access to privileged and pedigreed schools are mitigated with better porosity allowing non-connected or affiliated households and families to have access to good institutions _ but on ballots. Everyone has equal chance _ for primary schools only. For secondary schools, it will be based on merit on scores and other non-academic attributes. This is very reassuring since education is the greatest social leveller.
The challenge to build a more just and socially equal society is a work in progress and the government must start with getting policies aligned and coherent and to deliver them with a heart _ not clinical coldness.
Homes and hearts must be in the same place. Where there are hearts that care, homes are where the hearts are.

THE policy changes that strike me most are in the areas of housing and healthcare. In terms of housing, there has been a lot of concern among the people, especially low-income families, about whether they are able to afford a home. PM Lee's speech provides a great assurance that every one of us will be able to afford a roof over our heads, and he provided a precise breakdown of the numbers whereby even a household earning $1,000 a month will be able to afford a flat.
As Singapore progresses, many of its citizens have begun to feel that the country is getting more and more expensive, catering to the rich and not to commoners. Likewise, medical care is getting more expensive for the man in the street. It is good that the PM's Office is rolling out various strategies to assure the general public that the healthcare system will remain affordable.
Having said that, I do feel that more can be done to address the issue of an ageing population. According to the Population White Paper released earlier this year, the number of citizens aged 65 and above will triple to 900,000 by 2030 and this group will be supported by a declining base of working-age citizens. This is a very serious issue that will impact the healthcare system and our society as a whole. I believe the PM's Office is looking into this issue and the policy changes he has announced during the National Day Rally show that the government is moving towards the right direction in terms of taking care of its people.
While these steps outlined by PM Lee are very encouraging, I would like to see more initiatives to help the low-income especially, who may not have a strong nest-egg for their retirement.

PM Lee inspired me to inculcate six leadership disciplines:
1. Envisioning _ Having An Electrifying Vision: PM Lee is part of one of the few if not the only team of leaders that plans 20 years in advance, a dream that captures our imagination.
2. Exemplifying _ Setting The Right Example: You may not agree with everything that PM Lee has said in all his speeches but you can't fault him for over-promising and not delivering on the major goods. More importantly, he has demonstrated by his leadership, performance and lifestyle that he is a leader who is worthy of our respect.
3. Enrolling _ Developing An Effective Team: As I studied PM Lee's team of leaders in the Auditorium, I have to say that by any international standards, it is a great team of people. They have the commitment, character, competence and compassion that have made Singapore one of the most admired countries in the world.
4. Empowering _ Enabling Teammates To Fulfil The Vision: PM Lee has been building upon one of the most effective leadership succession models. As Singaporeans, we should be thankful that few governments in the world have a more vigorous system in selecting, developing and promoting its leaders.
5. Encouraging _ Inspiring and Motivating Your Team Mates: Throughout his speech, PM Lee gave credit to individuals, communities and the government, all of whose constituencies are important and vital in building our nation. He was generous in praising fellow colleagues and ordinary persons on the street.
6. Excelling _ Taking Your Team Unrelentingly To Higher Levels: PM Lee reminded Singapore about the rapid change and uncertainty caused by globalisation, technology, and competition.
He challenged us to change our mindset, aim high, and adopt a new strategic direction so as to enhance our well-being, advantage and growth.
Thirumalai Chandroo

HEARTFELT and motivated _ that's what I felt of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech. It was a speech that addressed facts and spoke of issues that many Singaporeans are grappling with on a daily basis. PM Lee addressed the core areas of housing, education, healthcare and building strong ties as a community, which are all important to keep the development of our small but feisty Singapore going.
One that really struck a chord with me as most significant is education; for I am in the business of teaching. Ensuring that our future generations are given the best opportunities and resources is important to me as it ensures that a well-educated community has a great deal to offer to the growth and stability of the country. PM Lee emphasised the importance of meritocracy in Singapore's education system. He also acknowledged that it could do with more changes, which is the hallmark of our nation that constantly seeks to better herself and never becomes complacent with her current success.
A holistic and open approach was the ideation behind our march forward for education this National Day Rally. PM Lee announced that PSLE is going to move towards a letter-based grading system which I view as a positive welcome, as it allows children to perform without the added pressure of how a single point in a T-score could ultimately affect their grades. As an educator myself, it is my thought that, when students are prompted from within to learn, they fuel inner qualities which are required for their destinations in advance. These qualities include resilience, creativity and self-discipline; which cannot always be tallied by scores.
Another significant move is the provision for secondary school students who are in the Normal Academic stream _ to pursue a higher level subject if they have done well in that subject in their PSLE. This is a very positive and enriching move for any student who may be weaker in some subjects and stronger in others. This allows students to expand their knowledge of subjects that they show keen interest in.
Thus having a broader banding system and opening up more options for our secondary students will maintain the positive effect of requiring schools to come up with a more holistic approach to their methods of education. It is progress towards creating students who are interested in reaching a particular goal fundamentally, and then the motivation to pursue it will fall from within. Their interests and natural abilities should become a starting point for learning, for them to enjoy the learning process and eventually specialise in a field that would become their career. Of course, on the contrary: a more open system at higher levels will also mean that parents may put more emphasis on children when they are younger, expecting pre-schools to offer a more academic-based curriculum as opposed to the ''play-as-you-learn'' approach we take today.
Though it appears to be a perfect tempest of changes, it will take time to develop these initiatives and understand their potential, and I believe that with our strong foundation as a developing nation, nothing can deter us as we continue to make headway in a constructive manner.

16,"Marginal increase A recent joint study by the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School's Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations (CGIO) and BoardAgender, an entity that seeks to advance more women into senior leadership roles and the boardroom, shows that only 7.9 per cent of all board directors in Singapore-listed companies were women last year.

","   LIKE Singapore, corporate Hong Kong needs to do more to address the gender imbalance in boardrooms. But unlike the city-state, the latter territory has gone a step further by requiring all companies listed in Hong Kong to report on their diversity policy and supply considered reasons should they not conform.
Concern over the lack of diversity which it views encompasses more than gender and age, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) has taken a proactive step in stirring up the mix. Under the stock exchange's ""comply or explain"" Corporate Governance Code provision which came into effect on Sept 1, listed companies are expected to implement policies to encourage more women, men aged 40 or younger and people of wider professional experience to join their boards.
While the Code does not specifically highlight gender diversity, the representation of women on boards is clearly a tangible measure by which companies can assess to what extent they are including a diversity of perspectives on their boards, said Community Business, a Hong Kong-based non-profit organisation focusing on corporate responsibility and a thought leader on diversity and inclusion in Asia.
In its report, ""Standard Chartered Bank Women on Boards: Hang Seng Index 2013"", its researchers found only ""nominal progress"" in female representation on the boards of HSI-listed companies: 9.4 per cent in 2013, up from 9 per cent in 2012 and 8.9 per cent in 2009. Four out of 10 listed companies have no women on their boards at all.
While Hong Kong performs below the global average of 11.1 per cent in developed countries, it fares better than mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore, India and Japan.
Marginal increase
A recent joint study by the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School's Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations (CGIO) and BoardAgender, an entity that seeks to advance more women into senior leadership roles and the boardroom, shows that only 7.9 per cent of all board directors in Singapore-listed companies were women last year.
This is up marginally from 7.3 per cent the year before and 6.9 per cent in 2010. All-male boards remained high at 58.2 per cent.
Looking at the 77 new directorships on the boards of companies on the HSI in 2012, just nine (11.7 per cent) were women. In comparison, in economies such as Australia and the UK, the proportion of new board appointments that are female is 30-40 per cent.
""Hong Kong clearly has some way to go in achieving greater gender diversity in its boardrooms. Indeed, if we assume that the total number of directors remains the same at 649, at the current rate of just four additional female directorships each year, it will take approximately 49 years to secure 30 per cent representation of women on boards and 81 years to reach parity,"" said Community Business CEO Fern Ngai.
The study, which looks at the representation of women on the boards of companies included in the 50 HSI constituent as at Feb 4, showed the top five companies are China Construction Bank Corporation with four of its 12 board members (33.3 per cent) being women, followed by Hang Seng Bank (31.3 per cent), Bank of China (26.7 per cent), and HSBC Holdings Plc (25 per cent).
The report also showed the number of female executive directors since 2009 remains static at 15 women. Fifty-three women hold 61 directorships on the HSI. This means six women hold more than one directorship.
The average age of male directors in Hong Kong is 60.2 years and the age range is wide, varying from as young as 29 years to as old as 90 years, with 31.3 per cent of male directors aged 65 or over. The average age of female directors is 57.7 years and the age range is narrower from 33 to 75 years, with a much lower percentage of 18 per cent of women directors aged 65 or over.
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd is the company with the oldest board members, with the average age of its directors being 68.9 years.
Earlier last week, Community Business also released its first-ever research on chairpersons' and directors' perspectives titled ""Board Diversity in Hong Kong: Directors' Perspectives 2013"". The report showed close to 90 per cent of the directors who participated in the study recognise the importance of ensuring a diversity of perspectives on their boards. However, 92 per cent indicated that they still face certain challenges in making their boards more diverse, with one-third citing the inability to identify diverse board candidates as a key barrier.
Despite studies showing a more diverse board improving performance, 76 per cent of directors saw board diversity as a measure to comply with corporate governance requirements rather than a move that made good business sense.
""These findings suggest that the business case for board diversity, and its link to enhanced business performance and competitive advantage, is still not well understood among Hong Kong's listed boards even though there is ample research that demonstrates the positive relationship,"" the report noted.
The Hong Kong survey, which ran from July 23 to Sept 6, revealed that 77 per cent of respondents stated their companies had taken some action following HKEx's implementation of the new code. Slightly under half (44 per cent) say they had an ""agreed and disclosed policy"".
HKEx's new code provision is widely seen as ""a tremendous catalyst for change"" but companies should not just ""tick the box"", Ms Ngai said.
Lead from the top
The key is to change mindsets at the board level as well as management's mindset to ensure ""substance over form"" in order to achieve better company performance in the long run. To achieve this, the lead should come from the ""top"", with the chairman playing a pivotal role.
The Hong Kong report concluded that boards should conduct a critical review of their diversity - including demographic aspects of diversity such as gender, culture and age, in order to uncover and address any hidden or unconscious biases - and thus create the basis for evolving their boards to ensure an environment where true meritocracy can flourish in the boardroom and beyond.

","   MORE than technology or access to a wide range of products, a key success factor for any financial services company is its people. It's an accepted fact that the talent base provides the competitive edge. Furthermore, the actions of the employees enable long-term relationships with clients, which results in the notion of trust in an institution.
To accentuate that point further, a key and necessary condition for any country to develop into a regional hub is the availability of a skilled talent pool, in addition to having reliable technical infrastructure and a pro-business environment.
As an institution with a 112-year history in Singapore, Citi accepts the responsibility that it has to play a role in the development of talent not only within, but also for the larger industry. This realisation is the cornerstone of Citi's talent development policies.
Over the past few years, Citi has actively engaged agencies such as the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) as well as other educational institutes to promote skills development and enhancement for the financial sector.
Last year, we introduced three initiatives for undergraduates from the local universities. These include the Citi Student Mentorship Programme, Citi Banking 101 Foundational Programme, and an undergraduate transaction banking course jointly with the National University of Singapore Business School. In 2013, close to 300 undergraduates benefited from these programmes.
In 2009, Citi introduced the Banking Associate Programme, which is a leadership programme designed to groom high potential candidates for specific functions within the bank. The bank also introduced the Citi Banking Trainee Programme, a 12-month internship programme that equips candidates with hands-on experience in specific functions within the bank.
In addition, Citi also hires some 200 fresh graduates every year from the universities for full-time roles. Today, 82 per cent of Citi's workforce here is made up of Singapore citizens and permanent residents.
Internally, we are also focused on establishing a workplace where our employees can thrive and excel. While we have globally benchmarked training and development programmes for our people, we are constantly re-evaluating our programmes to ensure relevance at every stage of their careers.
In this rapidly evolving global landscape, the need to innovate in the area of training and development has become more important than ever. When it comes to developing top talent, we adopt a holistic approach incorporating three key elements - Exposure, Experience, and Education to accelerate the growth of our high potential talent to take the next step up the leadership ladder. Our goal is to provide our people with a ""career of a lifetime"".
An example of a renowned Citi talent initiative is our Management Associate Programme, which we launched 40 years ago and has a proven track record of producing dynamic leaders all over the world.
The programme targets fresh graduates, accelerates the career development of outstanding individuals, and places them in leadership positions early in their careers. Its unique feature is the opportunity for associates to rotate across businesses over a 36-month period. Those who top the class are offered cross-border assignments to give them a head start to international exposure.
At Citi, we do not adopt a one-size-fits-all model for our talent programmes. As employees at different stages of their careers require different skill sets and mindsets, the programmes that we offer are designed to meet their developmental needs. While we have customised programmes for our top talent, we also believe that all our employees must be given the opportunity to succeed in their roles and reach their full potential.
Every year, Citi Singapore hosts over 2,000 classroom and Web-based training programmes for our employees to select from based on their learning objectives. To create a high-performance team, all our employees, including non-managers, undergo leadership courses as we believe that the learning journey begins with self-leadership. Through our global Citi Leadership Series initiative, we foster a culture of performance, productivity, meritocracy, and teamwork among our people.
Citi's approach to developing talent is a recognition that any institution that wants to be a leader must live up to its responsibilities. And this responsibility is not only to the institution itself, but to the wider community as well.

","   Four senior bank executives share their views on the importance of training and development as the financial sector becomes increasingly complex
The Business Times: How has the importance of training in the financial sector grown and what are the reasons behind it?
Evangeline Chua: The global financial landscape has become a lot more complex over the years. The retail banking industry is a case in point, where the trend towards online and mobile banking has changed the way in which banks traditionally interact with clients.
The requirements of corporate and institutional clients who rely on banks for loans, capital markets services and M&A advice have also become more complex.
On the regulatory front, banks have gone through major transformations since the 2008 financial crisis; reforms have been made to strengthen financial systems.
The growing complexity of the financial sector points to one thing: continuous education and learning in the industry cannot be overstated and banks need to raise the skills and deepen expertise of human capital to ensure continued relevance in this rapidly evolving landscape.
Laurence Smith: As a leading player in Singapore and Asia, DBS operates in a complex environment with many challenges and opportunities. Ensuring that our people are equipped with the right skills to capture growth opportunities while navigating industry challenges has become increasingly important. Our ability to attract, develop and retain talent has always been a key priority for us, and has enabled us to execute against our strategic blueprint to become the Asian bank of choice for the new Asia.
Cassandra Cheng: Competent and talented employees are a key differentiator in the financial industry talent crunch in Asia. Banking is a people-centric industry, and as the banking industry evolves, the supply of talents has not been able to meet the demand. Talents with regional and global knowledge are all the more in demand and scarce.
These talents are necessary if we want to effectively interact with our customers who are increasingly expanding their global footprint.
At OCBC Bank, employees are our greatest asset, and they are vital in our continuous quest to grow OCBC into a world-class bank. We take a two-pronged approach in talent acquisition and management. Through our Management Associate programmes, we continuously bring in new talents. Internally, our investment in developing and fostering our employees' capabilities is one of the top priorities on our business growth agenda.
Jenny Wong: While many banks are challenged with re-establishing relationships with their customers post-2008, Singapore banks are progressing well on this front. Customers depend on their bank to provide a reliable service centred on sound advice, relevant products and excellent customer service. And the quality of this service is only as good as the people who provide it.
To ensure our customers receive a high standard of advice and service, UOB places a lot of focus on developing the skill sets of our people through training and making sure they have the right mindset.
As we navigate through a constantly changing business environment, a highly competent, adaptable and motivated workforce becomes all the more critical. For this reason, we will continue to invest in the training and development of our people based on the bank's competency framework and to ensure that they meet industry standards.
BT: How have Institute of Banking & Finance (IBF) training programmes benefited the employees in your organisation?
Chua: IBF's training programmes have provided the necessary competencies for our bankers. As the national accreditation and certification agency for financial competency, it raises the overall standard of the financial sector workforce in Singapore through the courses that it provides and this has enhanced Singapore's position as a leading financial hub worldwide. In addition, over the years, the partnership between IBF and Citi has helped build a strong pipeline of bankers for both leadership and specialist positions at Citi.
Smith: By participating in IBF training programmes, our employees have been equipped with relevant certifications and skills to deliver a comprehensive suite of products and services to our clients. We have also embedded programmes that have been accredited by the Financial Industry Competency Standards (FICS) within our training and development frameworks to ensure that our staff are well-versed and able to apply the industry's best practices in their day-to-day business dealings, that will in turn enable them to accelerate their careers.
Cheng: With IBF's implementation of the FICS accreditation and certification system, several of OCBC's senior management have been conferred the Distinguished Financial Industry Certified Professional (DFICP) title, which is the highest certification for a financial practitioner in Singapore under the FICS framework.
Bank of Singapore, OCBC Bank's private banking arm, introduced its proprietary training and assessment programme, the Programme for Wealth Management Professionals, in February 2012. This IBF-accredited programme will ensure that its private bankers have the right knowledge, skills and attitude to meet the increasingly complex and sophisticated demands of the financial industry.
Wong: As UOB builds a sustainable franchise in the region, we recognise that our continued success depends heavily on the strengths of our people. Over the last five years, the Bank has invested significantly in IBF-certified training for employees to complement our in-house training programmes. These programmes and certification provide relationship managers with a clear roadmap for career progression and also give our customers the assurance that their banker is well qualified to serve their needs.
Beyond technical skills, we encourage the sharp minds in our bank to apply the knowledge they have acquired and to seize the right opportunities for customers.
BT: What innovative training and development initiatives do you undertake in your organisation?
Chua: When it comes to developing our high potentials, we do not adopt a one-size-fits-all model. As employees at different stages of their careers require different skill sets and mindsets, the programmes that we offer are designed with these considerations in mind.
While we have customised programmes for our top talent, we also believe that all our employees must be given the opportunity to succeed in their roles and reach their full potential. Every year, Citi Singapore hosts more than 2,000 classroom and web-based trainings for our employees to select from, based on their learning objectives.
To create a high-performance team, all our employees, including non-managers, undergo leadership courses as we believe that the leadership journey begins with self-leadership. Through our global Citi Leadership Series initiative, we foster a culture of performance, productivity, meritocracy and teamwork among our people.
Smith: To enable our employees to learn both in and out of the office, as well as on the go, we have launched a mobile learning platform, mLearning.
We have also developed online personalised learning roadmaps that enable our staff to assess their individual career progression as well as development opportunities available to enable them to accelerate their careers. With these roadmaps, they will be provided with a clear idea of the training programmes best suited to their individual roles and levels of experience. This will also allow them to be better prepared to discuss their career development plans with their respective managers.
Cheng: Our training and development efforts cut across age groups and seniority levels to ensure succession bench-strength and a pipeline of leaders, ready to assume more senior roles. We have programmes for younger talent such as the Fresh Graduate Management Associate Programme and Post Graduate Management Associate Programme. Initiatives like the OCBC-Insead Executive Development Programme and Future Leaders Programme are designed for future leaders, while the OCBC Smart Asia Programme caters to senior management.
OCBC Bank is the first Singapore bank to set up a city Learning Campus in the central business district to meet employees' learning and development needs.
Wong: Keeping training programmes relevant and realistic, and at the same time interesting, is important in ensuring that participants are fully engaged. This is why we are constantly exploring new ways to use new media, simulations and blended learning techniques including online courses and project-based learning to make our training sessions interesting and interactive for employees.
The training our employees receive combine academic rigour and practical learning that professionals must have to succeed. They provide a solid foundation from which employees can progress in their careers. New courses are introduced in step with the changing banking environment and we enhance existing courses to ensure our people stay relevant throughout their careers.
BT: How do you ensure that training is translated into action on the ground?
Chua: Talent in our high-potential programmes are given challenging cross-franchise projects outside of their job scope to fast-track their personal and professional growth. To keep training relevant, our programmes are reviewed and updated regularly based on feedback from employee surveys and business leaders, as well as the changing business landscape.
Smith: We involve our line managers in the learning and development process by sharing with them the key concepts and core skills covered in the training programmes. This is so that supervisors are aware of what their staff have learnt and how they can add value and help create more synergy within the teams and improve day-to-day operations.
Cheng: We do not have a quantitative way of tracking if training is being translated into action on the ground, but what is most important is to equip our staff with the right skill sets and knowledge which will prove useful to them in their line of work, whether it be for their present or future job roles.
Wong: A true test of whether our courses are setting the right standards is through measuring customer satisfaction levels. Such measurement lets us know whether the skills and knowledge acquired by our people are being put to good use in serving the best interests of our customers. Last year, UOB received more than 12,000 customer compliments because of the good service and care shown to our customers, a 17 per cent increase over 2012. Customer satisfaction has increased in tandem with the growth that we have seen in our business, as more people across the region choose to become UOB customers and as existing customers deepen their relationships with us.
BT: What challenges do you face in ensuring your employees have the relevant skills to be successful in the current environment?
Chua: The evolving regulatory landscape requires all financial institutions to keep pace with new initiatives to bolster the regulatory framework and have a vision on how to implement the changes across the firm. Technological advancements pose another challenge and it has changed banking distribution and how clients seek information and advice. As change is a constant, we need to keep one ear to the ground to ensure our employees get the right training necessary to not only be successful in the current environment, but also remain relevant to the needs of our clients in a changing environment.
Smith: The financial services industry is a fast-moving and dynamic one. It is important for us to review and update our learning solutions on a regular basis to ensure we keep abreast of the latest developments and help our employees remain at the forefront of banking.
We also constantly improve the medium and formats in which we deliver our training content to ensure that we appeal to our multi-generational and culturally diverse workforce. With a greater emphasis on social and collaborative learning today, we tap new technology to change the way people learn and provide the relevant tools to facilitate this.
Also, we provide our employees with opportunities to gain greater exposure across different geographies and businesses in the bank, allowing them to progress further in their careers.
Cheng: As the banking industry continues to evolve, making sure our staff can adapt to the ever-changing corporate and regulatory landscape can be an overwhelming and challenging task. We need to constantly stay on top of the latest industry trends and make improvements to our training programmes to stay relevant to their changing needs.
It is also important that we equip our staff not only with the hard skills, but also the soft skills. They need to have the necessary ""people skills"", for instance, to know how to interact and build rapport with colleagues and customers in the global environment, and the ability to adapt to changes and think out of the box.
Wong: Nurturing talent through continuous training and job exposure takes time and investment. But we believe this is essential to develop future leaders with the breadth of exposure and depth of experience across disciplines and countries.
While the regulatory landscape is evolving, customers' expectations are rising amid greater market volatility. Still, we are fortunate in that Asia's long-term prospects remain sound and South-east Asia remains a bright spot. We must take full advantage of this window of opportunity and finance professionals need to step up in light of these rapid developments. This makes training even more important as we strive to give customers the assurance that their bankers are not only well-qualified to serve their needs in these dynamic times, but that they will do so with the customers' best interests at heart.

","   ONE of the unfortunate realities of economic discourse in Singapore is that outside the government, there is relatively little research on practical public policy, especially social policy.
So the publication of the book, Hard Choices: Challenging the Singapore Consensus, featuring the views of scholars who do not serve in government comes as a breath of fresh air - even more so for the fact that, as its subtitle suggests, it questions some long-held assumptions and dogmas, some of which have been baked into policy for decades.
Policymakers, academics and members of the public have come to accept as axiomatic certain policy ends and means - what the book's authors describe as ""the Singapore consensus"". For example, it is more or less taken for granted that economic growth is always good, universal government-funded welfare schemes are generally bad, meritocracy is an unmitigated plus, an ageing population portends serious problems and home ownership is good for everyone.
The authors of Hard Choices seem to believe that these axioms are open to question, or at least qualification.
The book consists of a series of essays, which have been published before separately, but which pack a powerful intellectual punch when put together in a volume. The essays are organised along different themes, though these sometimes overlap.
The issue of inequality is one major theme that runs through the book. Unfashionable in economics until recently - governments were focused more on economic growth than income distribution - inequality now takes centre stage in economic debate. The global financial crisis was a watershed that exposed the dimensions of the problem; Singapore, too, has suffered from rising inequality since the 1990s.
Donald Low's fine essay, The four myths of inequality in Singapore, addresses some of the common misconceptions about inequality. He argues persuasively that it is not an inevitable consequence of growth and dynamism; the evidence shows that unequal societies do not produce superior economic outcomes.
Nor is helping the rich the best way to help the poor; in Singapore, the introduction of a less progressive tax system since the 1990s has increased inequality, which has not been sufficiently offset by redistributive policies in the form of Workfare and discretionary fiscal transfers, which Low suggests have ""simply not been aggressive enough"". He makes a strong case for reinforcing them.
However on the regressive tax policies, the situation is not simple. Singapore needs to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) - much more so, relative to economic size - than the high-tax economies of Northern Europe, which are frequently cited as a model in this book. While Singapore has many non-tax advantages relative to other countries, it cannot allow its tax rates to get too far out of line.
Since the 1990s, several economies, including Singapore's competitors, have been reducing their tax rates. Could Singapore have held the line with a top marginal tax rate of say, 30 per cent, when Hong Kong was at 15 per cent and Ireland, 12 per cent? Would it still have been able to attract the sort of FDI that it did? And if it did not, what would have happened to growth and jobs? Would lower-income Singaporeans have been better off? This seems unlikely.
Low rightly points out that people care more about their incomes relative to others than about their absolute levels of income. He notes that income inequality also leads to inequality of opportunity, which then perpetuates the problem: the children of the rich generally get a better education than the children of the poor, which carries inequality into the next generation.
He also contests the view that unequal pay is purely the result of unequal ability. He points out that wages are not only a function of productivity, but also of immigration. Thus he recommends that ""to raise the wages of our lower-skilled workers, the emphasis should NOT (his emphasis) be on raising their productivity, but on reducing our intake of low-skilled foreign workers.""
Certainly, reducing this intake will lead to higher wages, especially given that Singapore has near-full employment. But it is not sustainable for wage levels to keep rising without a rise in productivity; companies hiring such workers will sooner or later simply go out of business. Nor should wages be allowed to shoot up sharply and suddenly by, for instance, draconian curbs on labour imports. Companies need time to adjust and productivity increases are typically slow.
Nor can Singapore adopt a one-size-fits-all policy towards labour imports. It is well known that in certain sectors, foreign workers are indispensable, at least in the short term. Construction is one. The marine sector is arguably another. Household help is definitely a third. Singapore could stop the intake of foreign maids, which would lead to the development of a local household-help sector, with wages perhaps five times higher than they are now. But how popular would this be, especially with families where women work?
The constant refrain throughout the book about the need to curb labour imports contains no caveats or a sense of calibration. Nor does it even mention the challenges Singapore will face when other social needs have to be addressed in labour intensive areas such as elder-care, where local professionals are in short supply. If Singapore is to curb labour imports in this industry too, it will need to find alternatives - and fast.
Immigration is another hot-button issue tackled in this book. In his essay The End of Identity, Thomas Vadaketh examines the impact of immigration on the Singaporean identity - or at least, his definition of it. ""Diversity must be celebrated,"" he writes, but ""it would be callous to ignore the impact of immigration on feelings of identity and belonging"".
Alas, there is little celebration of diversity in this essay. Quite the reverse, the impact of immigration, it would seem, has been unremittingly negative.
Some of his arguments are more polemical than analytical or even factual. For example, echoing a lot of Internet chatter, he cites ""many stories"", ""one common anecdote"" and ""countless accusations"" to assert that immigrants have ""torpedoed Singapore's meritocracy"", for example, by recruiting friends from back home rather than qualified Singaporeans, or by employers giving preference to foreigners over locals. No evidence is cited for these claims, which human resource professionals, at least, will tell you are baseless. Many companies are, in fact, having a tough time hiring per se.
In passing, Vadaketh takes a rather unkind dig at the China-born Singaporean Olympic and Commonwealth Games medal-winning table tennis player Feng Tianwei, who ""to the bewilderment of her fellow citizens, has not bothered to learn English, despite having lived in Singapore for five years"".
In her defence, she does speak Chinese, which is one of Singapore's official languages. It is not as if she speaks only, say, Swahili. Besides, one wonders what Vadaketh makes of his many Singapore-born, non-bilingual Chinese, Malay and Tamil-speaking fellow citizens.
Sadly, the essay has nothing to say about how Singapore has gained from immigrants - for example from new entrepreneurs, ideas and skills in areas ranging from technology to finance to education, which have enabled many companies to grow, to the benefit of Singaporeans as well, and from advances in R&D and innovation, where foreigners work with Singaporeans in agencies such as A*Star. Nor a word of appreciation for the thousands of foreign construction workers who have helped to physically build so much of modern Singapore, or the foreign medical staff who have cared for the sick, or the foreign maids who have taken some of the burden off working families and helped raise generations of children. Nor indeed is there any appreciation of the greater diversity and richness in the artistic, cultural and culinary scene, as manifested, for example in the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, many of whose talented musicians are of foreign origin; there is also no mention of the foreign-born chefs and restaurateurs here, which has created the greatest variety of international cuisines in Asia. All of the above contribute to the quality of life, but this is not acknowledged. It has become unfashionable, and even politically incorrect, to speak of such things.
What is fashionable to speak of is the angst that immigration has created and which is the main focus of Vadaketh's essay. He complains that foreigners have disrupted the traditional Chinese-Indian-Malay composition of Singapore; whether this is actually true or not, the perception must be acknowledged.
But as he would know, every country with a history of immigration has gone through changes in its social makeup. At the turn of the last century, existing settlers in America complained about Irish and Italian immigrants. These days, there are complaints about Spanish-speaking newcomers from immigrants who came earlier. Changes have occurred in the UK, Europe and Australia as well. Eventually, people adapt to social change and some, at least, grow to welcome the diversity, including in Singapore. As the US national immigration forum has pointed out, ""every new wave of immigrants has been met with suspicion and doubt and yet, ultimately, every past wave of immigrants has been vindicated and saluted"".
This has been true of Singapore as well. Its society has hardly been static; since the last century, successive waves of immigrants from different places kept changing the ethnic and social makeup and added to the richness of the society, in every sense. So while one can sympathise with Vadaketh's nostalgia for one specific social configuration, it is a poor argument to clamp down on immigration.
It also does not sit well with his later point - an insightful one - that the ""fragile, embryonic Singaporean identity"" is evolving. He notes that Singapore is in the middle of a transition from a highly rooted ""national identity"" to a less-rooted ""global city"" identity, the latter being the identity that many migrants embrace. Increasingly, Singaporeans too are going the same way, becoming more cosmopolitan and global in tastes, outlook and world view.
Thus, after all his complaints about immigrants, Vadaketh is able to end on a positive note, suggesting that ""Singapore has unwittingly created a model for a future where nationhood, ethnicity and religion should not matter"". ""Each must be celebrated but remain secondary to the higher human identity.""
And he points out, correctly, one of the great strengths of Singaporeans is that ""they can find common ground with more people than any other nationality"". It is hoped they will be able to do this at home as well.
The impact of immigration on the job market has attracted a lot of attention. One oft-cited observation, repeated several times in this book, is that low-cost foreign workers have allowed businesses to keep Singaporeans' wages lower than they otherwise would be. This is probably true, but it is also too simple - a macroeconomist should look at the bigger picture. As Ng Yew Kwang, Winsemius Professor of Economics at the Nanyang Technological University, has pointed out, while foreign workers can have the effect of depressing wages at the low end, they also contribute to the more efficient use of resources such as land and capital. The classic example is that once cited by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, about a factory that operates a day shift and a night shift. Singaporeans work the day shift and foreigners, the night shift. If you remove the foreigners, the factory becomes less efficient and maybe even unviable. In this particular example, the day-shift Singaporean workers benefit from the presence of the night-shift foreign workers. The whole factory benefits, and so does the economy.
The point is, you have to look at not just wages but also efficiency. The more productive use of land and capital because of the presence of foreign workers is a positive effect that must be weighed against the negative effect of lower wages. Even if the negative effect dominates and inequality rises, it is arguably better to resolve the issue through fiscal transfers rather than attacking efficiency by removing foreign workers.
On what happens at the top end of the workforce, Vadaketh launches another polemical broadside, citing ""the perception"" that ""the global elite has moved here with containers of cash in hunt of lower tax rates and is creaming off the spoils of Singapore's growth"". It is not clear who he is talking about. Fund managers? Entrepreneurs? Billionaires? Nor is it clear how they are doing this skimming.
In her essay, Linda Lim takes the more reasoned view that at the upper end of the labour market, the presence of foreign workers reflects the fact that high-skilled jobs in many areas actively promoted by the government, such as high-tech electronics, petrochemicals, financial services and digital media, require specific skills that cannot be met locally. She proposes reducing the state's ""micromanagement of investment allocation"". But she does not say which sectors she would like see de-emphasised, which would be a tough call.
She also proposes revamping the education system by placing less emphasis on grades and more on soft skills and multicultural versatility, which Singaporean graduates allegedly lack and employers increasingly require. The government is trying to do this, for example, by the de-emphasising grades relative to skills, but Lim has a point and there is surely scope to do more.
In their essay on social safety nets, Donald Low and Yeoh Lam Keong bravely challenge the Singapore establishment's consensus view that social benefits be targeted at the needy, and make a case for northern Europe-style universal programmes that benefit the large majority of the population. They cite studies arguing that universal programmes foster greater social trust, because they lead to less inequality and greater social cohesion. They acknowledge that these programmes are more expensive, but suggest that policymakers ""weigh their costs against their benefits"".
However, while the benefits are elaborated on, the costs are not. They are likely to be substantial and would almost certainly entail draconian increases in taxes. Since northern Europe is cited as a model, it bears noting that top income tax rates range from 48 per cent in Norway to 57 per cent in Sweden. The middle classes, too, pay direct taxes, unlike in Singapore, where some 70 per cent of the population does not.
Indirect taxes would probably need to go up sharply as well. In Scandinavian countries, VAT rates are around 25 per cent. The people of Scandinavia accept this social contract of high taxes and high benefits.
Leaving aside whether Singaporeans would be willing to swallow such tax increases, even given the unquestioned benefits of universal programmes, there is also the issue of tax competitiveness. This is much less of an issue for northern European countries, which do not need to compete for foreign investment to the extent that Singapore does.
However, the authors do have a point when they say: ""The critical question to ask is not how we can keep social spending on a tight leash, but what kinds of social spending would deliver the greatest social benefits.""
It is worth translating this proposition to some policy action. While a universal programme of social spending would probably require punitive levels of taxation, Singapore can afford ""selective"" universality. In particular, it could provide universal free education from kindergarten all the way through to a first university degree for all Singaporeans. Education is the ultimate ticket to social mobility. And as there are already subsidies being provided, albeit the regime being riddled with complicated qualifying criteria, the cost of extending these on a universal basis without exception would not be prohibitive. This would achieve at least some of the worthy social goals the authors seek.
On the issue of ageing, Low's preference for zero population growth and his hardline view against immigration, dismissed as something ""Singaporeans will not accept"", leaves him with little choice but to propose that the way to deal with ageing is simply to adapt to it rather than try to mitigate it.
How? He advocates a ""slower growth model"" which relies largely, if not entirely, on productivity growth. He also calls for reforming the Central Provident Fund system and health and long-term care financing system.
There is an assumption here that slower growth will somehow be accompanied by higher productivity, which is heroic and not borne out by recent experience. The costs of a higher dependency ratio and the implications for taxation, which will be considerable, also call for elaboration.
The assumption that population growth is not an option is questionable as well. Low suggests that ""even if our physical carrying capacity is not yet near its maximum limit, society's absorptive capacity is probably nearing a critical threshold"".
He is probably right for now, although the government, which has been on the defensive on this issue since the 2013 population White Paper, has not pressed the case for population growth. A case can be made, if Singapore's population is more spatially distributed and its infrastructure substantially enhanced - both of which are in process.
As Low correctly points out, quoting behavioural economists, our assumptions about the future are often anchored in the present; ""citizens' perceptions of quality of life in the future were . . . influenced by their current lived experience of congestion and crowdedness"". He adds that ""anchoring in the present"" can be a mistake when projecting into the future.
He could take his own advice; attitudes to immigration, too, can change. As the research of professor Benjamin Friedman of Harvard University found, such attitudes typically wax and wane over time, depending on economic conditions. Anti-immigrant sentiment has never been permanent in any society with a history of immigration, it remains to be seen how long it will last here.
There are many other issues in this book that this review has not tackled, such as housing, politics and governance, where, too, the authors call for reform. Some of these ideas will be considered iconoclastic. But that is one of the merits of this book, which, whether you agree with it or not, is arguably the most stimulating and provocative ever written on public policy in Singapore. It deserves the wide readership it has received.

20,"According to the latest official data on CPI based on income groups, the poorest-earning 20 per cent of households allocate more of their total expenditure to food than the rest of the country.

","   A CLOSER look at Singapore's latest inflation numbers reveals how the lower-income segment of the population might be bearing the brunt of price increases. Core inflation rose 2.2 per cent year-on-year in July - an elevated but still manageable number on the whole. Headline inflation, which includes transport and housing, at 1.2 per cent was lower than market expectations. But not everyone experienced such benign inflation. The reason is that the consumer price index (CPI), on which we base our national inflation estimates, is simply our best guess at how much a typical household's typical consumption would typically cost. Of course, most people are not typical. Different households with different income levels consume different quantities and different types of goods and services.
According to the latest official data on CPI based on income groups, the poorest-earning 20 per cent of households allocate more of their total expenditure to food than the rest of the country. To be exact, a household with income falling within the bottom 20 per cent spends about S$27 out of every S$100 spent on food, compared to S$24 out of S$100 for the middle 60 per cent of earners and just S$18 per S$100 for the top 20 per cent of earners. Health care is another area where the lowest income earners spend proportionately more - over S$7 per S$100 for the bottom 20 per cent versus less than S$6 per S$100 for the middle 60 per cent and the top 20 per cent.
The bad news for the lowest-income households was that food and healthcare prices were two of the three most inflated CPI components in July as well as year-on-year over the January-to-July period. That means inflation in those areas hit the poorest segment of the population more than the wealthiest. Costlier necessities was not the only thing that went against the lowest-income segment. Education prices have also been one of the fastest climbers in the CPI. The problem with education prices rising so quickly is that it limits the upward mobility of the poorest and threatens the meritocracy model to which Singapore subscribes. Transportation prices also fell year-on-year in July, and was the slowest inflating component of the CPI over the year-on-year January to July period. But with subdued car prices and certificates of entitlement the main cause for the drop, it was the wealthier households that benefited the most from the modest inflation in transportation.
The only major respite for the low-income households came from housing, where prices have been moderating following a few rounds of cooling measures, although this can be a double-edged sword. Slowing or falling home prices can save costs on one hand for renters, but erode asset values on the other for homeowners. Singapore's inflation is thus not affecting everyone the same way. This is yet another reason why fiscal transfers to lower income groups should be maintained, if not increased.

Victor Mills
Chief Executive
Singapore International Chamber of Commerce
WHAT we need is a mindset change from students, their parents and from employers. Our society's focus on getting a degree is unbalanced. For many people it has become a paper chase - a tick box exercise which does no one any good. Education is a great benefit but it should never be the most important factor when hiring. The ability to relate to our fellow human beings is far more valuable to an employer than a degree. That is why I would encourage more SICC member companies to give greater weight to a candidate's character, values, skills and potential and less to whether or not a candidate has a degree.
Laletha Nithiyanandan

THIS is a necessary evolution as Singapore matures as a society. Our government has taken the first step by merging the graduate and non-graduate schemes in the public sector.
But this transition will take time because employers, parents and society as a whole have been ingrained in their thinking that having a university degree provides higher value and progression.
As an employer, I think that some form of continual learning is essential for employees to stay relevant, current and thrive in the workplace. All employees, whether they have a degree or not, still need to be committed to ongoing learning in order to stay competitive.
The biggest contributor to this culture change is the employer. Employers need to demonstrate that they are willing to reward employees fairly based on the value they offer by reviewing their current hiring and compensation processes to give equal weighting to capability and experience.
Russell Tham

AS the global leader in precision materials engineering, our pipeline of talent needs to be equipped with highly specialised skillsets to develop and build cutting-edge products that help drive the worldwide semiconductor industry. This required level of expertise does not come solely from academic qualifications; it requires practical training, experience and job performance.
This is why at Applied Materials, we have always evaluated, promoted and rewarded employees based primarily on performance and merit. We believe this is the predominant philosophy in most global multinationals as well.
In Singapore, this is an opportune time for the public and private sectors to progress towards a more egalitarian form of meritocracy where competencies and performance are most important.
A fulfilling and rewarding lifelong career should never be limited by academic qualifications; it should be determined by core values, skills, learning agility and results.
Max Loh
Country Managing Partner

THE conventional definition of talent and success that is premised purely on paper qualifications is slowly losing relevance in today's globalised world where diversity of talent is highly valued.
Even in the regulated professional services sector, where minimum qualifications are needed to enter the profession, it is clear that high-performing teams are the differentiators as a result of harnessing their mix of skills and experiences to develop innovative solutions and drive enterprise value.
A shift in mindset and education and hiring values will be important in embedding a broader notion of talent, which can come in all forms.
Having said that, hiring and reward must continue to be driven by one's merits in contributing to business goals even as employers strive to be inclusive. Also, there must be genuine acceptance in society that there are many pathways to success, including entrepreneurship. The successes of many of our homegrown entrepreneurs are not always founded on qualifications but rather a combination of personal qualities, skills and experiences.
Philippe Huinck

ITALIAN Renaissance diplomat and writer Niccolo Machiavelli once said: ''Whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times.''
Corporate cultures cannot be changed, only shifted. Neither can a culture shift be mandated or always require a 360-degree approach. At times, it may just need slight adjustments to achieve the desired outcome. I believe a successful culture shift will be more effective by leveraging existing cultural strengths within the organisation.
Beyond the job title and pay raise, employees need to recognise that increased responsibilities will always mean higher expectations from management. At the same time, employers must value staff and develop them according to the core purpose of the organisation, ensuring that they grow in their knowledge, both in theory and practice.
The nature of our work at International SOS means we respond to world events as they happen, so we look for individuals with a can-do attitude, who are creative and thrive on challenges. Our job opportunities are diverse and include medical careers for doctors, nurses, medics, pharmacists, public health experts and occupational healthcare professionals.
As long as an individual has the right knowledge and skillsets specific to their job, coupled with a compatible personality fit, he or she is more than qualified for career advancement.

IT is encouraging to note that the government has served as a catalyst for change by taking the first step to close the gaps in career prospects for both graduates and non-graduate civil servants. This sets the tone at the top and a push towards a change in paradigms. No longer will there will be a preoccupation with university degrees but a genuine appreciation of all the factors that make a successful employee. To complement this, Singaporeans from all walks of life must also change their mindsets in order for us to move towards a culture that recognises both skills and university degrees.
Organisations can take the cue from the government to change their culture and policies so that individuals of all skills and qualifications are recognised. Though changing an entrenched culture does not happen overnight, organisations can start with baby steps in the direction of culture change.
We need to acknowledge that both technical expertise and soft skills are becoming increasingly important ''must-haves'' for employers when hiring new staff. This can be reflected in a concrete way by tweaking an organisation's recruitment criteria, remuneration policies and performance appraisal systems to give more recognition to skills and on-the-job performance track records.
Organisations can also implement the use of competency frameworks as a guide to hiring skilled and qualified staff. A strong message will then be sent out to pave the way for an organisational culture that embraces diversity and recognises the actual contributions of employees, regardless of their academic status.
Cynthia Stuckey
Managing Director
Forum Asia-Pacific
MANY of the people leadership skills needed to succeed in the global workplace are not taught or given enough emphasis in the university. Soft skills such as the ability to give feedback and to motivate, coaching, strategic thinking, effective delegation, and customer focus play second fiddle to technical skills, which are the prevailing focus of formal education across all levels.
Functional or technical skills are important but it is people leadership skills that differentiate high performing individuals, leaders and organisations. And while we would all agree that learning these skills even before entering the workforce would be useful, it is never too late to start.
Thus the government's call for an integrated system of education, training and career progression merits the strong support of the academic, social and business communities to ensure that all Singaporeans achieve career success not only here at home but also overseas.
This effort requires the commitment of many, including the smallest unit of society - the family, where parents play a key role in cultivating the right mindset and values in their children.
Only then can we foster a culture that values skills and the contributions people make over degrees and titles, giving rise to a generation of Singaporeans who are confident and primed for challenging cross-border business environments.
Victor Wong

IN my view, the travel and hospitality sector in Singapore already embodies the new employment culture that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong raised during his National Day Rally speech.
In many ways, good skillsets and experiences are equally valued alongside qualifications. We see the focus of internships weaved into the hospitality-related tertiary courses. Within the industry, we do see very capable leaders rise the ranks to the management level even without university qualifications.
The travel and hospitality sector might be a unique one. As for other industries, continued (re)education is crucial to shift Singaporeans' mindset to embrace a new employment culture where skills are valued as equally important to university degrees. Sharing more success stories about Singaporeans who have carved out a niche for themselves based on their skills and experiences will also help encourage the society in the paradigm shift.

AT UPS we agree that there are many routes to success. In fact this is an ingrained part of our ''promote-from-within'' corporate culture. Forty years ago, David Abney joined UPS as an 18-year-old university freshmen loading trucks. Today, Sept 1, 2014, he becomes CEO of UPS.
Spending decades at one company is pretty rare nowadays. But it's not all that unusual at UPS. And that's because we believe that we grow not only by investing in our business, but also in our people, regardless of their role or education.
For skills to count as much as diplomas, companies must implement training and HR initiatives that level the playing field and help employees develop those skills that are most valuable to the organisation.
Our most effective leadership development programmes are rotation schemes where employees are transferred across departments and geographies to deepen their holistic understanding of our operations and broaden their skills base.

UNIVERSITY degrees have regularly been perceived as a passport to success but recently there has been growing emphasis among employers to evaluate candidates based on other factors.
While having a university degree is likely to help candidates get a foot in the door, most companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional metrics and also considering factors such as internships, overseas experience, cultural fit and relevant skillsets when making hiring decisions.
Kelly Services has, for instance, been collaborating with Temasek Polytechnic where we run a career centre to invigorate studies with working experience. Students who show keen interest and do well during their course will then have the opportunity to carry out their industrial attachments with us.
The recommendations proposed by the ASPIRE (Applied Study in Polytechnics and ITE Review) committee are good steps to further encourage this kind of culture in Singapore. To make this initiative truly successful, government and schools must ensure that the skill upgrading programmes are relevant, affordable and accessible, especially for those who are currently working.
Employers are likely to appreciate the real work experience and recognise the value of the certifications if candidates can show that their skills have been developed in a meaningful, strategic and structured way.

EDUCATION providers will play a significant role in the Prime Minister's vision of a new employment culture in Singapore. As the public and private sectors shift to a more holistic view of employee value, continuing education opportunities which are relevant to advancing science and technologies will be fundamental to the development of skills and talent in the workplace.
Providing an equal platform for access to such programmes is crucial in order for skilled, non-degree holding employees to not be left behind.
Universities and other higher education institutions will need to constantly adapt to offer industries specialised training and education programmes which are in tune with strategic objectives of industrial stakeholders as well as being flexible, not only in terms of schedules to help students meet dual work/study demands but also in terms of intake criteria.
We are seeing an increasing number of industry leaders identifying and nurturing talent through skills development and further education.
Newcastle University International Singapore, for example, provides higher learning programmes to employees from industry leaders such as Keppel Corp and Sembcorp Industries not simply for education's sake, but to equip employees with relevant skillsets to meet their potential and progress in their careers.
Yeoh Oon Jin

BY introducing practical policy changes to reward non-graduates in the civil service, the government is taking the lead in steering this shift to recognise skills and performance rather than just paper qualifications. They are the largest employer in Singapore and this is a positive step to initiate the change. It now rests upon other employers to do the same.
At PwC Singapore, we certainly welcome this ''new'' employment culture. We have always adopted a well-balanced approach in recognising talent and the value they bring to the firm, regardless of their academic feats.
For example, we hire non-graduates and provide equal promotion and developmental opportunities for them to up-skill and achieve the necessary competencies and qualifications. Our remuneration philosophy is to reward according to performance and to offer career progression based on skill and merit.
Although gradual, I am upbeat that the shift will take place as our performance-driven economy continues to evolve.
David Crammond

Maachu Pte Ltd
IT is heartening to hear that Singapore is now shifting to a new culture where the emphasis on skills count as much as university degrees. Academic qualifications should only be one of the many criteria which define a person's ability.
It would certainly be too myopic for employers to judge a prospective employee based on his paper qualifications and not take into consideration his relevant skillset, character and aptitude for the job. Many entrepreneurs such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs have proven that securing a degree is hardly a prerequisite to success.
Placing too much emphasis on university degrees is a mistake that is seen within the recruitment industry. Often, job seekers will tailor their resumes to suit the job descriptions.
At Maachu, we have developed a unique job matching technology which reinvents the online recruitment market and the way we recruit talent. The solution combines proprietary talent pooling and algorithms with a systematic method of profiling critical job criteria relevant to both employers and candidates.
Paper qualification is one key basic entry point requirement. Acquiring new skills along the way is just as critical. It is therefore important for workers to continually upgrade their skills to perform better in their jobs so as to move up the corporate ladder.

SINGAPOREANS have traditionally been embroiled in a paper chase, believing that higher academic qualifications will lead to better and more stable job opportunities. However, with more organisations becoming flatter and leaner today, there has been a shift in the mindset that prioritises education over experience.
Employers today are looking beyond an individual's academic achievements and are seeking the experience and transferrable skills that can help in the development and growth of their organisation.
The new ''employment culture'' will encourage young Singaporeans to think outside of the box and pursue vocational skills in areas that play to their natural strengths - instead of choosing to go down the traditional higher education pathway purely because of the belief that this will get them a better job.
It will take some time before Singapore gets fully acquainted with the notion that skills matter as much as university degrees. However with the current efforts by the government, private sector and labour unions to promote the acceptance of non-graduates in the workforce, the shift towards this new employment culture can take place sooner rather than later.

WE should help enterprises set up what is known as a corporate university. The purpose of such an institution is to help them provide lifelong and upgrading learning programmes to their workforce.
This is a strategic tool that is widely leveraged upon by many great companies such as General Electric and is an important part of developed economies.
A corporate university with a relevant hands-on curriculum can help enterprises enhance lifelong learning, knowledge management and change leadership on both organisational and individual levels. It can also help improve corporate governance, productivity, and results.
Perhaps the government can apportion resources to help enterprises launch and tap on this best practice. It can also encourage and empower local universities to provide such services, especially to SMEs so that they can compete and succeed in the new economy.
Enterprises can also explore running a corporate university on their own, as a strategic alliance, or in partnership with a business consultancy.

IT will take a long-term and concerted effort by the government and private sector as well as the general population to effect such a culture shift, but with the endorsement of the national leadership and the strong signals given in the National Day Rally speech, the intent to change is there. Now it is up to us to heed the call and take those first steps.
Businesses need to evolve in the way they recognise, reward and develop talent. Parents need to understand and embrace the different ways one can define success. Collectively we need to keep an open mind and recognise individuals' skills and personal inclinations.
Ultimately this will be driven by business needs and not all roles are best served by degree-holders - the time spent obtaining a degree may sometimes be better spent learning real skills on the job and through other dual-track pathways.

Fortis Healthcare Singapore
HEALTH care is one industry where truly, a degree is not always a fast track to a successful career. For allied health positions such as nurses and therapists, as much emphasis is placed on attitude, skills and experience as on paper qualifications when it comes to hiring and promotion. In health care, we value the people themselves, their commitment to patient care and passion for service excellence.
Forging a skills-based employment culture will take time. Ensuring equal access to training opportunities and progression pathways for everyone, regardless of academic background, will require structural adjustments.
Social recognition at the industry and community levels will entail a mindset change. Finally, the definition of ''success'' must transform to one which celebrates meaningful work and enriching experiences over financial rewards. Only with more real-life success stories would young Singaporeans be encouraged to disregard the so-called conventional route.
Lim Soon Hock

THE new culture, where skills count as much as university degrees, expands on the definition of meritocracy and takes it to a higher level. In my opinion, it has always been intrinsic to meritocracy, except that in the past, it has been overwhelmed by the emphasis on academic and scholastic excellence.
Although overdue, the government's call to employers and unions to join forces with government, to harness industry support and social recognition for people to advance at work, based on their skills, expertise and experience, is a welcome move, and augurs well for Singapore.
The government has taken the lead to implement this new employment culture, with the swift action taken to merge more graduate and non-graduate schemes, to give a more equal footing, regardless of academic qualifications. Some government agencies such as People's Association and uniformed groups have already been practising this, so the government is not starting from ground zero.
Many MNCs, like those which I have worked for, also have this policy in place, as often when recruiting staff, they specify that they will consider experience and skills, in lieu of academic qualifications. Many of our successful entrepreneurs are sterling and inspiring models of this new culture. Entrepreneurship is their skill and expertise.
One flanking strategy to make this work, therefore, is to build and entrench an entrepreneurship culture in Singapore. It has to start with our youths. Halogen Foundation Singapore, a not-for-profit organisation, is seeking just to achieve this, by transforming street-smarts - who typically are not academic-smarts - especially those from poor, marginalised and vulnerable families, into business-smarts, through a 30-week structured entrepreneurship programme, in collaboration with Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship from the USA.
This new culture, when combined with a vibrant and dynamic entrepreneurship culture, can be another powerful pathway to enhance social mobility. The government's lead in embracing this new culture is a critical success factor. This new culture will take root when there are more senior civil servants and those in political office, achieving the best that they can be, without academic qualifications.

EVERY successful employer knows the key to hiring well isn't certificates but competence. Certainly, good paper qualifications often indicate the potential for success but this isn't always the case. The Prime Minister's announcement regarding the merger of graduate and non-graduate schemes in the public sector is a large step forward as it will allow graduates and non-graduates to reach management roles, on the basis of performance rather than academic qualifications.
Working closely with talent across different backgrounds and experiences, we have learnt that success is achieved with better performance evaluations and opportunities for continuous learning regardless of starting qualification.
So the government needs to spread this conscious cultural shift by working with the private sector to encourage promotion based on performance and also work with education providers to offer employees more opportunities to keep learning. Degree equivalents such as technical certificates that help recognise and expand the skills gained at work should be easily accessible.
What is crucial is the capability to learn, adapt, grow and perform in the present and the future rather than the certificate you received in the past.
Brendan Wauters
President & CEO
Senoko Energy Pte Ltd
SENOKO Energy is heartened that the government is taking the lead in encouraging companies to look beyond paper qualifications when recognising the contributions of their staff. Senoko Energy has been a longtime firm believer that beyond qualifications, skills development, commitment and on-the-job performance matter just as much.
Mr Lim Leong Chuan, our Vice-President in charge of Instrumentation and Control, is one good example of a staff member who has benefited from this. Mr Lim joined the company in 1984 as a unit controller after graduating from the ITE. Over the years, the company has been supportive of his pursuit for career progression through skills upgrading. Mr Lim obtained a diploma, and eventually a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from NTU (in 1993).
Another example of our commitment in this respect is Senoko's award of scholarships to deserving applicants, as part of the Singapore-Industry Scholarships (SgIS) administered by the government.
Priti Mehra

AN excessive focus on university degrees is a legacy of the past. After all, for nearly three generations, degrees practically guaranteed a job in the field of your study as well as steady career progression.
However, today, a focus on skills development will allow employees to achieve their personal goals by charting their own course through an organisation. I fully back Prime Minister Lee's observations regarding the need for an integrated education system, and believe that with government and industry support, alternatives to a university degree will not only become socially accepted, but also will be recognised as a serious choice for individuals who want to maximise their potential.
From an employer's perspective, we need to take a holistic view and look at candidates' intrinsic ability, performance, creativity, and lateral thinking, instead of using paper qualifications as the only filter. Additionally, organisations need to put in place programmes enabling employees to continually broaden their skillset. Continued up-skilling leads to a high performance environment, helping organisations, in return, to achieve their strategic goals.
Seah Kian Peng

NTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd
AS a major employer in Singapore, NTUC FairPrice's philosophy in talent management has always been to develop and nurture potential to enhance the long-term employability of our staff.
Apart from educational qualifications, we value qualities such as dedication, commitment and experience among other virtues. As part of our holistic approach towards staff development and to enhance skills and knowledge, we provide training and capability development. This includes equipping them with skills from professional courses provided by recognised institutions and helps to empower staff with confidence in the role and function that they play.
In addition to training, we provide flexibility for staff to be rotated or transferred to various departments. Recognition and opportunities for career progression to recognise their contributions are also in place to serve as motivation. With such a structure, we are proud that many of our staff have risen through the ranks, including some serving in senior management positions.
Chris Mead

THIS may be a big shift for many employers, but the key to remember is that it is skills and experience that employers look for when they recruit above the entry-level. While graduates find that their degree can help them land their first entry-level job, it is experience and rapid expansion of their on-the-job skills that would chart their career progress.
So perhaps a starting place would be for graduates and universities to understand the value of hands-on experience, which is viewed highly by potential employers.
One way to do this is to encourage students to do work placements or internships during their studies. This allows students to prove and enhance their skills in a real job, with real targets and performance expectations.
Employers should allow interns the chance to add real value to the business so that when they graduate and look for a full-time job, they have some proven on-the-job successes to share with a potential employer.
Recruiters can also work with employers to identify the candidate who has the appropriate skills and experience needed to do the job, not just a certain degree or qualification. Ultimately it is a person's technical skills, not what they studied, that allows them to succeed in a job.
Jianggan Li

Easy Taxi Singapore
THE main challenge is changing people's mindset on education and the value of a university degree.
In our hiring process, we have encountered a lot of good candidates (whom we eventually hired) who do not possess university degrees. While it does help to have one, companies also look into a candidate's skills and experience. Ultimately, it's not the degree that brings success, but the person himself.
What we've noticed is there are so many candidates with great potential who think they have limited capabilities because they do not possess degrees. To bring out the full potential of these candidates, we need to initiate a cultural shift.
The Internet industry is also disrupting many traditional trades. We are offering people an opportunity to perform and be judged by their achievements rather than qualifications.
Kelly Kuhn

Carlson Wagonlit Travel
CARLSON Wagonlit Travel supports and is already practising the principles of the Prime Minister's recommendations. We hire people based on their work knowledge, skills and competency rather than which university they graduated from.
We have partnered with the polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education to speak to their students about job opportunities as corporate travel consultants and provide an overview of career opportunities at CWT. We also offer internship programmes to their students interested in travel management, and have a management trainee programme in place for interns who have proven their skills to join at an entry level and further their career.
In order for Singapore to move towards a new culture, we believe greater awareness is required about the career path provided by companies which offer occupational-skilled jobs, alongside success stories of companies with non-graduate employees having fulfilling career opportunities.
Annie Yap
Managing Director
AYP Associates Pte Ltd
IT would take more of a top-down approach, especially from the public sector, to change the importance placed on a university degree. The public sector has always been very stringent in hiring only the cream of the crop of each cohort, degree holders with a high GPA.
Hence, it is vital that the government set the example of gradually placing more emphasis on the importance of skills, rather than academic results alone, to enter the civil service.
Furthermore, with two more universities due to be opened by 2020, increasing the number of students entering university to 40 per cent, skills would naturally become the differentiating factor as a degree no longer becomes as relevant.
Likewise, the curriculum of the new universities can be more skills-based to set the tone on the importance of skills. However, as with all mindset shifts, the changes will be only gradual. Hence we do not expect employers to disregard the university degree in the near future.
Min Chow
Managing Director
LEWIS Singapore
OUR experience as a PR and digital consultancy has proven that paper qualifications alone are not sufficient to secure a job or progress. For entry-level candidates, we look for the ability to manage multiple projects and lead teams. For mid-level candidates, we look at the depth of work experience and developmental potential for senior roles.
As such, we view candidates with or without a university degree on an equal footing as the focus is on the relevant work experience, soft skills, and work ethics. Career advancement is based on merit and we help progress talent through initiatives such as overseas secondment, region-wide training workshops, and a bi-annual 360 feedback system.
The private sector stands to benefit from taking the public sector's lead and adopting similar bold changes that put all employees, regardless of paper qualifications on equal footing, by rewarding talent based on job performance.
Much remains to be done to cultivate this skills-based employment culture of inclusiveness and equal opportunity through training and development.
Philip Yuen
Chief Executive Officer
Deloitte Singapore
WE recognise that diversity of talent is crucial and while we want intellectual rigour, it is important not to rely purely on academic results as a benchmark. There are many exceptional individuals who have remarkable achievements beyond academic qualifications and need opportunities from organisations to help them succeed.
For instance, Deloitte's membership in the spexBusiness Network for Athletes provides us the chance to hire national athletes and it has benefited us because our employees, athletes and non-athletes alike, can interact and share with one another different unique skills, mindsets and experiences that are mutually enriching.
Beyond this, it is also important to take into consideration the attitudes and expectations of Generation-Y employees. In a study released by Deloitte in January 2014, millennials are set to comprise 75 per cent of the global workforce by 2025, and they want to work for organisations that foster innovative thinking, develop their skills and make a positive contribution to society. If we want to attract and retain talent, organisations will need to be innovative and in tune with their employees.
Sam Yap
Group Executive Chairman and Co-Founder
Htwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd
THE Prime Minister's National Day Rally speech on emphasising skills over paper qualifications and alternative routes to career success was well-received by many.
Htwo Holdings applauds this creative and practical move. In fact, Htwo Holdings has been practising this ''employment culture'' for a while already. As an organisation, Htwo Holdings has always paid attention to our employees' skills and experiences in the recruitment of manpower.
As much as academic and professional qualifications are important to gauge the person's capability and potential, we also take into consideration the employee's skillset and past experiences which will support his job function and achievement of targets set for him. An employee without paper qualifications but with vast work experience and good work ethics and attitude can perform just as well as or better than those with a degree.
As employers, we must be open-minded about this to bring out the best in our staff. They are rewarded through their overall work performance and achievements for the company with career progression tracked for them.
For Singapore to move towards this culture, a multi-pronged approach involving employers, unions and the potential market of employees is needed. In my mind, the more important goal in achieving this ''shift'' would be the widespread social recognition of a worker's career advancement based on skills and motivation to better himself through continual education and training. Good examples could be highlighted in the media to give motivation and added push to those without the paper qualifications but who aspire to do better.
Christophe Duchatellier
CEO
Adecco Asia
SINGAPORE'S employment culture is a diverse mix of various talents. As it strives to remain a global centre for international business and research and development, graduates as well as employees must realise that constantly upgrading their skills, learning new knowledge and adopting creative mindsets, is a necessity.
There should be a shift in the social mentality that succeeding at the ''paper chase'' is not enough. Organisations want to hire motivated and adaptable employees with relevant skillsets.
At Adecco, we also firmly believe in training and career progression. Countries like Singapore, with limited resources, can get a stronger competitive advantage from training its workforce, regardless of age, experience and entry level.
Developing a successful and fulfilling career has to be seen as continuous lifetime training. Degrees and qualifications are one way to enter the workforce, but career progression is best achieved with a well-managed training strategy.
Shawn Balakrishnan
General Manager
The Hoffman Agency Singapore
SKILLS will always be valued by businesses. The question is, will non-university certified skills be similarly valued? Yes, but only if businesses back up their verbal support with actual action - putting their money where their mouth is.
The Prime Minister mentioned the excellent calibre of graduates from polytechnics, ITEs and other non-university institutions, and while businesses often express verbal support for these graduates, the only way Singapore can move forward in terms of solidifying an ability-based, meritocratic business culture is by businesses leading by example and matching their verbal support for these institutions with action.
This can come in many ways, but partnerships that provide hands-on industry experience is an excellent start.
The Hoffman Agency, for instance, partners Ngee Ann Polytechnic, mentoring students in an introductory PR programme. Such partnerships provide the credibility, experience and show of belief from businesses that these institutions may benefit from, while simultaneously giving businesses the opportunity to talent-spot and increase their talent pool.
Chris Comer
CEO
Castlewood Group
I MUST say that I definitely agree with PM Lee Hsien Loong's view that a university degree isn't the only way to a successful career. At Castlewood Group, we have long been an avid believer in the abilities and capabilities of our staff rather than focus on their academic background.
What we have witnessed, especially among our sales division, is that our top performing staff tend to be those who have certain life skills and high emotional intelligence - something which cannot be taught at university. That said, we do value further education, and particular skillsets and accreditation are required for particular industries, so we support our staff in their ambition and regularly sponsor their education.
Empowering and educating staff is vital not only for their personal development, but also allows the company to evolve and progress. At Castlewood Group all staffers are provided with mandatory in-house training, regardless of previous work experience or educational qualification. We always like to promote within and recognise the achievements of individuals to acknowledge and reward great work done on-the-job, rather than hedge our bets on employees' future potential according to their university degree.
The proposed cultural shift is a welcome change and will depend hugely on the support of employers. The first thing that needs to be done is to remove the stigma attached to not possessing a degree - this age-old attitude is still very prevalent here, so it is up to the government and trade unions to look for a change in mindset. A fully-devised plan should be put in place, such as persuading employers to pledge a certain amount of non-graduate placements, run regular internships, or provide work experience opportunities for candidates who have expressed an interest unrelated to purely academia.
Once the plans have been laid, it is down to the taskforce to actively promote and bring awareness to the scheme such as running regular job fairs, that will give candidates the opportunity to not only get in front of potential employers, but give them the encouragement to pursue what they want to do to improve both in their jobs and in life.

ICAEW
THERE are over 142,000 ICAEW Chartered Accountants in the world, many working at the highest levels of business, practice and government. A significant number of these members do not have a degree and underwent the ACA qualification to attain the required knowledge, skills and workplace experience needed to succeed in accountancy and finance.
Though having a gold standard qualification opens doors, what sets our members apart is their ability to marry deep technical knowledge with real job experience, tied together with a firm foundation in ethics. They are rewarded and recognised because of what they can bring and apply to the workplace - and not simply on the basis of their qualification backgrounds.
People from a variety of backgrounds bring a valued diversity to the profession which cannot be overstated. We champion opening access to the accountancy and finance sector. We recognise the value of offering different routes to the accountancy and finance profession and that is why we recently partnered with Singapore Polytechnic to offer diploma students an accelerated route to chartered accountancy.
We have also seen an increase across many markets in non-degree students taking the ACA and students in Malaysia topping the international ACA examinations ahead of a global cohort of whom many graduated from prestigious universities.
To answer this week's question, we do not believe that Singapore should move to a new culture where skills count as much as university degrees. We believe that Singapore must move to a new culture where people are evaluated by their contributions and achievements. This will help us maintain our competitiveness in a highly complex and fast changing world.
Roland Smith
Vice-President and Managing Director of APAC
Center for Creative Leadership
REGARDLESS of degrees, this is about building capabilities for Singapore.
Skills will be viewed as much as university degrees when we acknowledge that universities are not the only places where meaningful skills are developed.
The Prime Minister gave several examples of continual training given to employees in the workplace, and while they are a great start, they are still the exceptions rather than the norm.
Training in the workplace must, first of all, be widespread among Singapore corporations for a skills-attuned business culture to develop. Secondly, it has to transcend the generic and be personalised in order to be effective, incorporating the employee's feedback to create a personally-effective developmental programme. Thirdly, the type of training provided has to eventually reach beyond individual skills and into leadership training, thereby providing individuals with not just the ability to be self-skilled, but to lead and guide others to do the same - within their roles in the workplace, family, communities and beyond.
All these can be achieved when each and every one of us recognises and develops learning agility, and actively pursues lifelong learning with a growth mindset.
Leslie Ong

VMware
FORTUNE'S top 10 fastest growing companies for 2014 are businesses that have proven that having an innovative scalable idea could be the starting point of a multi-billion-dollar setup. It is interesting how the growth of these conglomerates also proves that success is not limited to only those who have won accolades from the world's most reputed universities.
As a country that propagates technology, innovation and entrepreneurship, the balance between skill development and university certifications is certainly a step in the right direction. Our youth need choice and avenues that can help promote the spirit of innovation, growth and entrepreneurship. This can only be achieved by harnessing the right skillsets.
At VMware, we are committed to creating a stronger IT workforce. Aside from our strong focus on innovation, we invest in enabling IT practitioners with specialist skillsets and certification programmes to keep up and keep ahead of the dynamic technology trends. Today, VMware Certified Design Experts (VCDXs) are part of an elite group of architects leading virtualisation implementations around the world.
Singapore has proven that technology can enable a stronger and a productive workforce and we are committed to partnering in the nation's efforts at building a Smart Nation and a Smarter Workforce.
Suhaimi Salleh

SSA Consulting Group
WE feel the call by PM Lee to embrace a new employment mindset and culture marks a watershed in the history of Singapore's human resource policies and practices. This shift is quite tectonic in nature with widespread effects. They impact the education and manpower ministries, industry partners, employers, HR practitioners, education/career counsellors, parents and students.
Yet, it will take some time for all parties to internalise, react and adjust to the changes that lie ahead. SSA Consulting Group employs both graduates and non-graduates. However, it does not employ different schemes of service for its employees. It has, all along, been giving equal importance to qualifications and skills in its recruitment policy. Like most employers, SSA values the formal pre-employment training and industry exposure that a potential candidate has.
The company rewards its staff based on the value-add that each employee brings, his/her actual performance, irrespective of seniority and qualification.
Dora Hoan
Co-Chairman/Group CEO
Best World International Ltd
ALL along, skills are valued by employers who are really interested in long-term development of their businesses. As job applicants are normally strangers to the recruiter, their qualifications are the only evidence of their skills, typically acquired at university.
With a buffet of candidates from all over the world offering more advanced skills, employers would also seek to optimise their costs by hiring the most skilled candidate at the lowest cost.
Nevertheless, the recommendations by the Aspire committee would be beneficial for Singapore to truly move towards a skill-oriented culture. The work-and-train programme and structured internships can allow the employers to truly assess potential employees instead of just relying on the paper. These provide a win-win solution whereby employers can run the businesses with qualified employees while the latter can be allowed to shine.
Robin C Lee
Group COO
Bok Seng Group
I AM glad that our country's leadership recognises the importance of this issue and it is timely now to tackle it as in the years to come, a big and growing fraction of our Singaporean core population will be graduates.
Without this culture shift, there will quite certainly be an acute shortage of Singaporeans willing to take on ''non-graduate'' roles. People must be remunerated not only for their academic achievements or qualifications but also the technical skills, experience and work ethics they possess.
Why should a well-trained 750-tonne mobile crane operator, who has gone through all the tough training to obtain Class 3, 4 and 5 driving licences before finally qualifying for crane operator certification, be paid less than one doing accounting, sales or marketing? One could be using more mental than physical labour, but in my opinion both types of work require good training, diligence, commitment and attitude.
So, yes, while having a degree is nice, a technical certificate or diploma is equally respectable if hard work has been put in. People doing all types of work must be respected for their contributions and character; the rest are strictly secondary.
I foresee the shift to a new culture where skills count as much as a university degree, unburdened by the conventional interpretation of social status by jobs. From young, we have been warned over and over by our parents and seniors that if we fail academically, we are doom to become garbage collectors. A scare tactic with good intention perhaps, but it does not impart the right values. A university degree need not be the only path to a fulfilling career. Instead, good solid skills acquired through training or experience should count as much. I welcome this paradigm shift in the culture and hope that such positive change can be sustained.
Zaheer Merchant
Regional Director (Singapore & Europe)
QI Group of Companies
A MINDSET change needs to take place for skills to count more than degrees. But the initiatives currently being emplaced by the government are a good start on that path. The ''paper chase'' has long been the ultimate goal but recognition is slowly creeping into all stakeholders' consideration (be they employees, employers or educational authorities) that in today's world, certain specific or broad-spectrum inter-disciplinary degrees may not stand an individual in good stead for the world.
Germany's apprenticeship programmes are a prime example of honed hard skills being well regarded without any stigma attaching to the lack of a paper-qualification, but also as a successful trade/vocation for an individual. A degree inculcates analytical thinking and reasoning, but without experience, it is plainly and simply a degree.
In a 2012 article, Forbes reflected on a ''jobless'' generation where 60 per cent of graduating students could not find full-time employment in their chosen professions without required ''skills''.
Clearly, lifelong learning of core, critical and specialist skills is key in the new work culture. The workplace has adapted for global competitiveness. It's time we all do so too, or face a ''pain point'' by a slide in competitiveness.

THE continued evolution of the Internet landscape has created a pressing need for cybersecurity experts. The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore recognises this, and is taking steps to increase the number of cybersecurity professionals in Singapore at both degree and diploma levels, enhance the skills of ICT professionals, and develop a pool of postgraduate researchers.
At the same time, there is room for the industry to provide more internship opportunities for those looking to join the field, both locally and overseas. The opportunity to test their security skills within a unique and real world environment is invaluable, and offers an education that goes beyond academic qualifications.
To keep pace with what has now become an omnipresent threat, businesses need to recognise that their focus should go beyond hiring top talent, to grooming the next generation of leaders to lead the charge against cybercrime.
David Leong

A DRASTIC mindset shift in education. A strong and emphatic advocacy on apprenticeship programmes in technical education. Setting standards for continuous learning and recognising those competency standards and Workforce Skills Qualification certification. All these are the needed ingredients for the change in education formats.
The ASPIRE panel is not saying that a degree is not important anymore. It is surely not saying that a degree won't get you ahead. A degree is a mark of one's academic journey, a milestone. I personally think ASPIRE is about providing more pathways to young Singaporeans to achieve success and map their academic journey at their own pace, and not necessarily getting a degree or diploma first. That can come later but with skills training, they can still get a respectable job and decent pay. These are important premises.
I think this initiative led by the government is very liberating for many students - those who are keen to get ahead but who do not wish to be labelled ''normal'' or ''technical'' - a label that can have great impact on their career development. The multiple pathways advocated by the government means they can achieve success through a skilling programme that is incremental and that they can also climb the wage ladder.
Learning is continuous and does not necessarily culminate with a degree for us to be deemed ''successful''. Removing the fixation on academic qualifications will help a great deal. This will hold a new promise for non-graduates and tell them that skills can weigh as much as academic scores now and they can get comparable pay if they can perform. It used to be that an ITE certificate leads to a dead-end road. That has changed. There will be more stopovers in the career journey to allow individuals to upgrade and skill up with time and to remain relevant to the job market and get recognised and paid correspondingly.

","   Companies could have an aspirational target for women directors by a stated time and with a targeted percentage, writes JUNIE FOO
AT the recent SID Directors' Conference, Grace Fu, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, created a stir when she named six publicly listed companies that did not have a single woman on their boards.
Actually, Ms Fu, who is also Second Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs, was being kind. She could have provided a much longer list. In fact, according to Gender Diversity on Boards: A Business Imperative - a report by the Diversity Task Force published earlier this year - 57 per cent of 780 companies listed on Singapore Exchange (SGX) have all-male boards.
The minister's frustration at the low level of board participation by women was understandable. Women comprise only 8.3 per cent of directorships of SGX-listed companies. Our neighbours, Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong, boast higher numbers. The global average is 11 per cent. The proportion of women on Singapore-listed boards is also well below the proportion of women in senior management positions (21.2 per cent), and in the universities (more than half).
""Unfortunately, progress has been slow,"" Ms Fu lamented. This is despite the fact that the Code of Corporate Governance has included ""gender"" in its guideline on diversity since May 2012.
A gender quota was mentioned by Ms Fu as ""a possibility not to be ruled out"", although she also said that non-regulatory means is the preferred approach.
Quotas
Gender quotas would be taking the route of many European countries that are at different stages of requiring between 33 and 40 per cent of boards to be comprised of women by 2017. Norway leads the way: since 2008, it has required boards of more than 10 directors to have 40 per cent women.
In context, Norway has a long history of promoting gender equality. In 1913, it was one of the first nations to grant women the right to vote. In the early 1980s, Gro Harlem Brundtland became its first female Prime Minister. In the late 1980s, the Act of Equal Opportunity was passed. Interestingly, the Act of Equal Opportunity requires any public body, board or council to have at least 40 per cent of each gender - male and female - represented; it, therefore, is not an affirmative action just for women. Norway is also one of the first countries to have a cabinet seat with responsibility for gender equality installed in parliament.
However, in my view, legislating quotas is not the panacea to every imbalance. Circumstances and culture are important.
Positive discrimination would go against our ingrained ideal of meritocracy. Quotas can result in tokenism and undermine the achievements and abilities (or, at least, the perception) of the genuinely qualified.
One study by Ahern & Dittmar found that ""quota(s) led to younger and less experienced boards, increases in leverage and acquisitions, and deterioration in operating performance, consistent with less capable boards"".
Indeed, I would say that this is probably the general sentiment in corporate Singapore. In the electronic polling conducted at the SID Directors' Conference, 79.5 per cent of the participants disagreed (with 41 per cent strongly disagreeing) with gender quotas.
Other measures
Ultimately, quotas address the effects but not the causes of gender inequality on boards.
But then, if not quotas, what else can be done?
The Diversity Task Force Report recommended 10 initiatives (gender quotas not being among them). In the interest of time, I will not get into the details of these initiatives.
My take is that the key issue is a cultural one. We have to change mindsets that have traditionally guided the core family values of Asian women being home-makers and primary caregivers. It certainly does not help that, in many instances, the selection of potential directors is still very much through the tradition of the ""old boys' network"".
In order for fundamental, structural and cultural change to occur, there must be a concerted effort by all stakeholders. This includes nominating committees making changes in their selection process to cast their net wider and pro-actively look at women candidates. Companies should be encouraged to build a leadership pipeline for senior women. Bodies such as SID must train more women to be board-ready (SID is working with organisations such as BoardAgender to encourage women to attend these courses).
Ideally, each company should have an aspirational target for women directors by a stated time and with a targeted percentage. To nudge companies forward, regulators could consider mandatory disclosures of plans for gender diversity.
Singapore leads in so many ways in good corporate governance practices. Board diversity, including gender diversity, is one area we can take the lead in if we collectively put our minds to it.

THE ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has updated and refreshed its constitution, coming out with a new vision for Singapore as the party gears up for the next general election.
Unveiling the vision, which the PAP formally adopted at a party conference on Sunday, the party's secretary-general Lee Hsien Loong said it wants to ensure that Singapore is a nation of opportunity, uphold it to be a fair and just society and nurture a democracy of deeds here.
To ensure that Singapore is a nation of opportunity, the PAP means opportunity for all Singaporeans, not for a privileged few.
""We mean doing our best to support those with less and bring everyone to a good starting point,"" said Mr Lee who is also Singapore's prime minister. ""We mean an open and compassionate meritocracy - where success and rewards are based on ability and contributions, but everyone must have a chance to prove himself, and even those who did less well will have something.""
Mr Lee was speaking at a PAP conference that wrapped up the party's 60th anniversary celebrations.
To create opportunities, he said Singapore must grow and upgrade its economy so that Singaporeans will have good and fulfilling jobs. It must also stress the importance of education.
Upholding a fair and just society has always been a fundamental goal of the PAP, but Mr Lee said this now faces headwinds from intense global competition, job-killing technology, a maturing economy, an ageing population and rising income inequality.
""That is why our New Way Forward emphasises levelling up the lower-income and sharing the risks through safety nets,"" Mr Lee said.
Among the safety nets introduced so far are ComCare, Workfare, the Progressive Wage Model, higher housing subsidies aimed at lower-income households and the Pioneer Generation Package.
But Mr Lee said a fair and just society will always be a work in progress. ""That is why we are introducing MediShield Life, which will provide better healthcare coverage for life and for all. And why I introduced the Silver Support scheme in this year's National Day Rally to complement the CPF (Central Provident Fund), to give lower-income workers a basic sum every month to help them in their old age.""
In nurturing a democracy of deeds, Mr Lee said the PAP stands not just for action for the people, but also action by the people. There are two aspects to this, according to him.
""First, for us to be able to do right by you, you must first help yourseslf,"" he said. ""While we are increasing our social support, people must still work hard, strive to upgrade and give it all they've got.""
Second, Mr Lee said Singaporeans must come together, participate in community life together and solve problems together.

","   The death of Singapore's founding prime minister prompted an outpouring of tributes, condolences and expressions of grief. Here are some of them, both from political and business leaders within Singapore and from abroad.
Many aspects of our lives bear Mr Lee's imprint - be it our HDB estates, our gardens, or the SAF. Without his remarkable foresight and relentless pursuit of Singapore's development, the Singapore that we know today would not exist. Singapore was his passion and he continued serving Singapore till the last days of his life.
- Tony Tan Keng Yam, President of Singapore
The Singapore we have today is his life's work, and his gift to all Singaporeans. Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Rest in peace.
- Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister
Lee Kuan Yew made Singapore to last. He led a team, not a one-man show.
He groomed new leaders. He built clean government, and a culture of telling it straight - telling people the problems, and finding a way to fix them.
- Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Mr Lee Kuan Yew dedicated his life to Singapore. He lived and worked to build a nation and to advance the well-being of Singaporeans . . . He gave us a country we can be proud of, a home to bring up our family and a better life we can aspire to.
- Goh Chok Tong, Emeritus Senior Minister
I vividly recall the first time I came close to him around 1967. I was assigned to take notes for him. I approached him in awe, but he surprised me, beyond expectations. He approached me, with almost brotherly attention, and correcting my necktie, said, ""Nathan, you must remember you are no longer in the labour movement"". It is a moment I cherish.
- SR Nathan, former president of Singapore
Mr Lee served in public office for almost his entire adult life. His passing marks an end of an era in Singapore's history. His contributions to Singapore will be remembered for generations to come.
- Low Thia Khiang, secretary-general, Workers' Party
I personally appreciated his wisdom, including our discussions during my trip to Singapore in 2009, which were hugely important in helping me formulate our policy of rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific. He was a true giant of history who will be remembered for generations to come as the father of modern Singapore and as one the great strategists of Asian affairs.
- Barack Obama, President of the United States
I pay tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew's determination in developing Singapore from a new nation to the modern and dynamic city we see today. His achievements were great, and his legacy is assured.
- Najib Razak, Prime Minister of Malaysia
Under his leadership, Singapore successfully transformed into a major economic hub in Asia, putting it on a par with other developed nations.
- Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia
A far-sighted statesman and a lion among leaders, Mr Lee Kuan Yew's life teaches valuable lessons to everyone. News of his demise is saddening.
- Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India
He was a visionary statesman whose uncompromising stand for meritocracy, efficiency and education transformed Singapore into one of the most prosperous nations in the world.
- Christine Lagarde, managing director, International Monetary Fund
He was not at all a charmer. He was not a flatterer. He had developed his point of view. He would present it with great intelligence and eloquence - not in order to get you to do something specific, but to understand the nature of the world in which you were living.
- Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of state
Mr Lee's contribution to GIC had been immense. In the three decades that he was chairman, he guided GIC through many global and regional financial crises and saw to key milestones in its corporate development . . . His insights kept GIC grounded and focused on the fundamentals when it came to investing for the long term. Despite his stature and busy schedule, Mr Lee always found time beyond board meetings to engage GIC. It was a privilege to have him in our midst.
- Lim Siong Guan, group president, GIC
Mr Lee played an instrumental role in nurturing corporate Singapore. The private sector and the business community benefited tremendously from his pro-business policies and vision to establish Singapore as a major business hub for Asia . . . Today, our hearts are heavy and filled with much sorrow as we have lost our nation's beloved hero on the 50th year of our independence.
- Kwek Leng Beng, executive chairman, Hong Leong Group
His contributions to Singapore are immense, but the legal profession owes a specific debt of gratitude to Mr Lee Kuan Yew. We enjoy effective, clear and enforceable laws, and an unimpeachable and incorruptible judiciary. We owe that first to Mr Lee's clarity of vision that sustainable economic growth is underpinned by the Rule of Law, and second, his relentless opposition to corruption of any kind . . . We will not see his like again, and are proud to count him as one of us.
- Thio Shen Yi, president of the Law Society
Mr Lee was a visionary, transformational and charismatic leader. He has led Singapore from a Third World nation to a vibrant First World city-state. Under his stewardship, Singapore has earned the reputation as a key regional and global centre for businesses, supported by world-class infrastructure with a non-corrupt and highly efficient government.
- Singapore Business Federation
The eldest son of a Shell employee, Mr Lee had a long-standing relationship with Shell. He was instrumental in getting his government of the day to attract multinational companies like Shell to locate their Asian headquarters in Singapore . . . Over the decades, Shell has benefited from his stewardship. We express our deepest condolences to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his family.
- Goh Swee Chen, chairman, Shell Companies in Singapore
Lee Kuan Yew eats, sleeps and dreams Singapore . . . He pushed for consolidation of the Singapore banking sector. He believed that in order for Singapore banks to make it in the face of rising competition globally, they needed to be big and strong. Today, all three Singapore banks are among the world's strongest and safest. From the time Lee Kuan Yew became MM until now, I've always addressed him as MM, because to me, he is the greatest mentor Singapore can ever have.
- Peter Seah, chairman, DBS Group
By boldly pursuing his visionary economic policies and focusing on good governance, Mr Lee and his government turned a colonial outpost into one of the world's most open and business-friendly economies. But just as transformative was how Mr Lee rallied a diverse people to stand together - as equal citizens - through a deft mix of vision, conviction and realism. His passing is a tremendous loss, but Mr Lee's life will continue to inspire us.
- Ooi Sang Kuang, chairman, and Samuel Tsien, CEO, OCBC Bank
When he retired as prime minister of Singapore, I gave him a dinner. During the dinner, I said Singapore without Lee Kuan Yew would not be here today. This is a fact. He is all for Singapore, business or politics. We are very lucky to have Lee Kuan Yew.
- Wee Cho Yaw, chairman emeritus and adviser, UOB Group
He left a very deep impression on me. In particular, I was struck by his speech at the Business China's first anniversary dinner in 2008. What he said then has guided me since. He reminded us that we must not let down Singapore's reputation for reliability and integrity. These core values that have shaped Singapore's past have also influenced my behaviour. He was truly a visionary leader who will be missed.
- Lim Cheng Teck, CEO, Asean, Standard Chartered Bank
Mr Lee was the master builder of Singapore's economic and social landscape . . . In fact, he has shaped our DNA so well that Singapore, Singaporeans and Singapore companies have become good brand names . . . His commitment to Singapore, unyielding spirit and astuteness are indeed qualities to be admired, remembered and embodied.
- Lim Ming Yan, president and group CEO, CapitaLand
Between 2006-2008, Citi had the privilege of having Mr Lee as a special adviser to our senior management and its board of directors on strategic and international matters. His astute insights of the world and business landscape were truly unmatched. It is with a heavy heart that we mark the passing of Mr Lee.
- Michael Zink, head of Asean and Citi country officer, Singapore
In the most difficult times during the early days of Singapore, Mr Lee led the people of Singapore to forge ahead and transform the nation into the success it is today. His courage, conviction and brilliance will continue to inspire future generations.
- Chua Sock Koong, group CEO, Singtel
Our best tribute to him is to continue to build on his legacy and passion for the continued growth of Singapore. His entrepreneurial spirit, relentless drive and wisdom will live in the hearts and minds of all of us here at UBS.
- Edmund Koh, country head of UBS Singapore
Few possessed the gumption like he did and despite the naysayers, Mr Lee remained steadfast in his duty . . . It is for his life's work that SMEs in Singapore today can strive, prosper and compete successfully, whether at home or abroad.
- Association of Small and Medium Enterprises
He was an iconic hero - a character right out of The Hero with a Thousand Faces - a role model for leadership whose memory should be maintained so that one can use it to compare others to as a means of maintaining high standards.
- Ray Dalio, founder, Bridgewater Associates

","   His extraordinary vision and lifelong commitment to Singapore's well-being won Lee Kuan Yew a place in the hearts of his countrymen.
WHEN Lee Kuan Yew stepped down from the Cabinet in May 2011 in the immediate aftermath of a general election, it set off yet another round of musings on the future of Singapore ""post-LKY"".
The former Prime Minister, after all, defined Singapore. His dominating influence and hand in Singapore policies remained intact long after he handed over the leadership in 1990, when he took a backseat advisory role in government as Senior Minister and later, Minister Mentor. But the man himself rejected even any ""statesman"" label, telling journalists just a few years ago, in his own inimitable way, that ""anybody who thinks he's a statesman needs to see a psychiatrist"".
He had been asked, in an interview for the 2011 book Lee Kuan Yew: Hard Truths To Keep Singapore Going, if he hoped to be remembered by young Singaporeans as perhaps a great statesman, one with tremendous guts. ""No, I don't,"" he said brusquely. ""First of all, I do not classify myself as a statesman. I put myself down as determined, consistent, persistent. I set out to do something, I keep on chasing it until it succeeds. That's all. That's how I perceive myself. Not as a statesman. It's utter rubbish.""
One doesn't ""become a statesman"", according to him, and he would not have been one at all, he said. ""It was circumstances that created me: the defeat of the British, the complete collapse of morale, the Japanese brutality, the re-occupation, the struggle for power between the communists and us as the British were withdrawing. That's what created what I am.""
What he wanted was to be a lawyer. ""Except that had I not chosen politics, who would run this country and what law will you apply?""
A lifelong passion
That early conviction and resolve - to free Singapore of its colonial masters, achieve self-rule and build up the tiny island state - became a lifelong passion and commitment to ensure its continued success. Through his twilight years, even after the Republic had, in the eyes of the world, attained cult status as a 20th century economic miracle, he continued to fret over its vulnerability and risks of annihilation, particularly with each new generation of Singaporeans growing up not knowing ""from whence we came"". For him, Singapore was ""an ever-going concern"", foremost in his heart and mind alongside his family. ""Singapore is my concern till the end of my life,"" he declared in Hard Truths.
Indeed, the very survival and well-being of Singapore defined his life. His strong sense of purpose, self-belief and decisive judgement - traits that marked his political career - were apparent early on. As he related in The Singapore Story, the first volume of his memoirs, he became de facto head of his family while still in his teens as his mother looked to him, the eldest of five children, rather than his father, on all important family matters.
His drive and determination were evident too as a student gunning for academic honours - he was ""disturbed and upset"" upon finding himself beaten to second place in English and economics at Raffles College, ""way behind a certain Miss Kwa Geok Choo"", whom he would later pursue and marry. Mrs Lee - whom Mr Lee described as ""a tower of strength"", his source of ""constant emotional and intellectual support"", died on Oct 2, 2010.
But if the socio-economic climate of the day, the trauma and hurly-burly of war and post-war economic depression in 1930s and 1940s Singapore marked his political awakening and shaped his outlook, the three and a half years of Japanese occupation were, for him, the most significant. The period gave him ""vivid insights into the behaviour of human beings and human societies, their motivations and impulses"" and informed his appreciation of governments and ""understanding of power as the vehicle for revolutionary change"", he said in The Singapore Story. The 23-year-old who sailed to England to read law at Cambridge University returned four years later a revolutionary fighter; he and fellow politically active Singapore and Malaya students left England with not only their degrees but also anti-colonial nationalist credentials.
Back home, Mr Lee soon made a name for himself representing striking workers in industrial actions, and found in the trade unions the mass support base he and his political comrades needed. And when their People's Action Party (PAP) - launched in November 1954 - won 43 out of 51 seats in the 1959 general election, he became, at 35, prime minister of a self-governing state.
Nuts and bolts
But if he had been ""uneasy"" about taking power, with ""no experience of administration"", not even in his own law firm then, his anxiety and the weight of his burden were the greater when he found himself suddenly in charge of a newly independent Singapore on Aug 9, 1965, responsible for the lives of two million people.
Still, with great vision and boldness, he and his Cabinet got down to the nuts and bolts of governing Singapore. Foremost among his many pressing concerns was to gain international recognition for Singapore's independence and domestically, to build up a defence force, keep law and order and not least, create a viable economy out of an island with no natural resources. And in housing a population then clustered in shanty towns and slum digs, he saw home ownership as a means to forge national belonging.
""After independence in 1965, I was troubled by Singapore's completely urban electorate. I had seen how voters in capital cities always tended to vote against the government of the day and was determined that our householders should become home owners, otherwise we would not have political stability. My other important motive was to give all parents whose sons would have to do National Service a stake in Singapore their sons had to defend,"" he said in his memoir From Third World To First. ""I believed this sense of ownership was vital for our new society which had no deep roots in a common historical experience.""
And in searching ""for some dramatic way to distinguish ourselves from other Third World countries"", he decided that - apart from adopting English as the first language here - a clean and green Singapore would be a competitive advantage: A well-groomed city with tree-lined expressways would signal to investors that Singapore was a disciplined nation that cared about maintenance and order.
But of all the policies and institutions he created, the most difficult that he had to implement as Prime Minister was bilingualism as he had proceeded on the wrong assumptions, he said in an interview in 2009. He had been mistaken, he conceded, in assuming that one could be equally fluent in two languages, and in equating intelligence with language ability.
Mr Lee, who found his own inability to speak Mandarin and Chinese dialects a big disadvantage early in his political career, made a determined effort to learn the language. In November 2011, he launched what he said was the most important book he had written - on his personal lifelong struggles to master the Chinese language and reclaim his Chinese heritage - and started at the same time a fund to help Singapore children become bilingual early.
Most of his philosophies and policies have become hallmarks of the Singapore ethos and system - a highly efficient, clean public service; meritocracy; competitive salaries for ministers; the rule of law; train and bus seats free of sticky chewing gum. His strategies of industrialisation, urbanisation, computerisation and globalisation have propelled Singapore, indeed, from Third World to First within four decades. But he had also been against building casinos in Singapore early on, and initially had grave doubts about going into the life sciences because of a lack of brainpower then.
And he did have his share of controversial beliefs and measures, including a number of pronouncements related to women. He once said that ""attractive and intelligent young ladies"" should go to finishing colleges so that they will be ""marvellous helpers of their husband's career"" and declared, on another occasion, that ""we shouldn't get our women into jobs where they cannot, at the same time, be mothers"". Many women here also remember the shock at hearing him once say that he regretted ""allowing"" Singapore females to be highly educated, when the trend emerged in the mid-1980s that the more-educated women were not marrying and producing babies - a problem that persists today.
Core beliefs
The ""Stop At Two"" population policy of the 1970s and the ""graduate mothers scheme"" that gave the children of graduate mothers priority entry to primary schools were two initiatives that the government eventually scrapped. But Mr Lee - who was given to being candid and matter-of-fact, sometimes to the point of impolitic frankness - held firm certain core beliefs. One was on the subject of nature versus nurture, at one point a topic of debate in Singapore.
As recently as July 2011, he said: ""From my empirical observation of people and leaders, I believe 70 to 80 per cent of a person's capability, his proclivities, his temperament, is genetic. The day you were conceived, at least 70 per cent was already fixed in the womb. If you are bound to be a capable person, you will grow into a capable person. If you are bound to be slow, you will be slow. Nothing can change that. You can't choose your parents.""
He did not believe, for instance, that leadership could be taught. ""I think you are a born leader or you are not a leader. You can teach a person to be a manager but not a leader. They must have the extra drive, intellectual verve, an extra tenacity and the will to overcome,"" he said. ""So, I would say . . . 70 per cent of what I am, I was born with it. Twenty to 30 per cent was what I learnt to be what I am.""
Singaporeans, who mostly knew him as a stern, no-nonsense leader, did get glimpses of some of his personal quirks - his disciplined lifestyle, regime of daily swims or bike spins, the cartons of Evian bottled water that were a staple on his work trips, his penchant for air-conditioning.
In a 2001 documentary about his life, he named the air-conditioner as the greatest invention of the century, and once wished that someone invented air-conditioned underwear. Describing it to The Asian Wall Street Journal in early 1999, he said that it could be ""a light polyester air-conditioned undergarment, enclosed around the neck, wrists and ankles, and battery-operated"". He added: ""Everyone can then work at his optimum temperature and civilisation can spread across all climates.""
And the softer, stoic side of the man emerged in his distress over Mrs Lee's illness, when he spoke about talking and reading to her every night as she lay inert in bed in her last two years.
Age did catch up with him. Mr Lee - who had a pacemaker installed in December 2008 - confronted his own mortality, wondering when the ""last leaf"" would fall, ""grateful to be still around"", and could laugh at himself. As he told The New York Times in an interview published in September 2010: ""I'm reaching 87, trying to keep fit, presenting a vigorous figure, and it's an effort, and is it worth the effort? I laugh at myself trying to keep a bold front. It's become my habit. I just carry on.""
But engage or challenge him on regional geopolitics or a subject close to his heart, such as Singapore's future, and he'd be back to his vigorous, feisty self. Indeed, he kept up a travel schedule even after retiring from the government in May 2011, taking on the role of a ""special envoy"" who continued to promote Singapore's interests abroad. And in early November 2011, when it was revealed that he was battling a neurological disease that made it difficult for him to walk, he said that one ""learns to adjust"", adding: ""I have no doubt at all that this hasn't affected my mind, my will nor my resolve.""
The man whose name is synonymous with Singapore among foreigners, and whom Singaporeans respect and appreciate for his extraordinary vision and lifelong commitment to the country's well-being, certainly also had more than his share of detractors. But as he told NYT's Seth Mydans in an interview published in September 2010, ""I'm not saying that everything I did was right . . . but everything I did was for an honourable purpose.""
The honour, Singaporeans would say, is entirely Singapore's - to have had him as its leader.

","   THE tributes and condolences streamed in all day, after the passing, on early Monday morning, of Singapore's first prime minister and founding father Lee Kuan Yew. They are still pouring in at the time of writing. They come from around the world - from global leaders and politicians past and present, academics and intellectuals, business people, social organisations, and ordinary citizens, even those from other countries. It is all a measure of the respect and admiration Mr Lee commanded, even in faraway places, over more than half a century of public life.
But of course, Mr Lee's passing is most acutely and profoundly felt here in Singapore. And Singaporeans have been fulsome and heartfelt in expressing their grief, their reflections and their appreciation.
Not many national leaders have been truly transformational, at least in a positive sense. Mr Lee will unquestionably go down in history as one who was. While of course many others - all manner of leaders and ordinary Singaporeans alike - have contributed to the transformation of Singapore from post-colonial backwater to post-modern first-world city-state with a hundred-fold increase in per capita income, no one would deny that it was Mr Lee who was the main driving force. Much of what has been achieved was the result of his vision, his agenda, his policies and his methods. He was the ultimate ""conviction politician"" who decided and did what he believed, even if it defied conventional wisdom or popular appeal.
Much of what he did was guided by what he considered to be pragmatism. Singapore's industrialisation strategy in the 1960s, based on inward foreign investment by multinationals, was for example, iconoclastic at the time, but he was persuaded it would work, and it did. Mr Lee also signed off on Singapore's big bets on electronics, pharmaceuticals and more recently, casinos - an industry to which he was firmly opposed for decades before pragmatically changing his view, on the grounds that it would be good for the economy and tourism, and it was.
In foreign policy, he relentlessly pursued strategic relationships for the benefit of Singapore, adroitly navigating third-party disputes and avoiding taking sides. And so it is that Singapore has cordial relations with both the United States and Iran, Israel and the Arab world, India and Pakistan, China, Taiwan and Japan; Russia and the European Union, as well as the biggest network of free trade agreements of any country.
Relations with Malaysia was one of Mr Lee's deepest foreign policy concerns. In an emotional speech after Singapore's separation from Malaysia in 1965, he declared: ""The whole of my working life I have believed in merger and unity of these two territories."" He kept up this belief long afterwards. In 1996, at a Singapore Press Club dinner, he expressed a glimmer of hope for re-merger, if Malaysia could retain its economic dynamism and embrace true meritocracy. But after the Asian crisis of 1997, this was not to be. Re-merger with Malaysia may remain one of Mr Lee's biggest unfulfilled dreams.
Honourable purpose
In domestic politics, Mr Lee's methods were sometimes harsh. He was wary of civil liberties and even, until late in his premiership, artistic and cultural expression. He could be uncompromisingly tough on many of his political opponents. He later acknowledged this. In an interview with The New York Times in 2010, he famously said: ""I'm not saying everything I did was right. But everything I did was for an honourable purpose."" All through his political career, he showed little desire to be loved, preferring to be respected and even feared, because, in his view, this enabled him to do what he thought was right for Singapore. It is fair to say he was selfless in that he was concerned not so much with his own achievements, but with Singapore's achievements.
It will be asked: what will change in Singapore with the passing of Mr Lee? The challenges facing the current generation of leaders are quite different from what Mr Lee faced. The economic challenges have to do with not just production but also productivity and innovation. Issues of economic inequality, as well as non-material concerns, have come to the fore. The political challenges are also different. In an era of the social media, there is a greater plurality of views and ideas. Politics has become more contestable, which calls for politicians to be more adept at consultation and consensus building than top-down paternalism. The globalised world of 2015 too is very different from the more economically fragmented world of 1965.
But some of the core strengths of Singapore will not, and should not, be allowed to change: The rule of law, the respect for order, the belief in meritocracy, inter-ethnic and inter-religious harmony, well-functioning institutions and an incorruptible administration.
These are the most precious legacies of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. And he created them not out of pragmatism, but out of a conviction that they are intrinsically right and good, in and of themselves.
It is for Singaporeans now, and their leaders, to build on these solid foundations.

MR LEE Kuan Yew will always be remembered and respected as a great leader, whose leadership combined extraordinary vision, which united our young nation, with pragmatic and flawless execution, which brought this vision to life.
Our tribute to him is to build on his legacy, with the same passion and commitment for the continued growth of Singapore - to be a place where we and our future generations will live, work and thrive. And doing so with humility and authenticity, and with courage and confidence in ourselves as a nation, to achieve great things. As individuals, we should be inspired by his insatiable appetite for continuous learning, striving to be better tomorrow than we are today.

MR LEE Kuan Yew left behind a legacy realised from his extraordinary vision, compelling charisma and an unwavering dedication to Singapore.
We must continue to cultivate a forward-looking mindset to reach for opportunities and stay ahead of the curve. This means we have to embrace competition as a catalyst for progress.
Our nation is built on strong fundamentals and they have kept us resilient to crisis. Factors such as a stable and capable government focused on the people's well-being; a robust economy that creates employment and prosperity; social stability from harmonious inter-racial relations; an education system that nurtures people excellence; and a first-rate healthcare system. It is vital we protect and build on these advantages.
Strive to give our future generations reasons to deepen their sense of pride and unity and we will continue to be exceptional.

WE WON'T see another man like him. The moving tributes by world leaders, and heart-warming stories by those touched by him confirmed that there won't be another Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
But Singapore needs another LKY, and more. Our business environment will become more complex as mega-trends are changing our world at a staggering pace. The best way for Singapore to succeed and honour LKY's spirit is to have more of LKY in the following ways:
Legacy - we should build on his legacy by uniting as One Nation to build a thriving economy and secure our future together.
Keep Sept 16 special as a Founding Father's Day - a public holiday in remembrance of LKY.
Young Singaporeans - we should continue to invest in developing young Singaporeans, not just in terms of knowledge and technology, but also to imbue in them LKY's resilience and competitive spirit, weaving his life story into school curriculums.
Success - post-LKY, our continued success as One Nation, One People, One Singapore, is our best honour to him!

THE mark of a man lies in the wealth he creates in his lifetime, and wealth is not just money alone but assets tangible and intangible, such as honour, peace, stability, goodwill, relationship and sustainability.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew has indeed made his mark, creating abundant wealth for Singapore, while taking relatively little for himself. We can best honour him by becoming like him. Let us all be wealth creators for our nation, fervently serving our country and people, while living modestly. In this way, we will build on the wealth Mr Lee has created for us all. We must also protect Singapore from anyone who may destroy what Mr Lee has created.
Creating good things can be costly, but Mr Lee has taught us that life would be lived fully if we can succeed by trying our best to reach new tomorrows that will better our lives and all around us.

THE greatest gift one can give is one's life for the good of others. Mr Lee offered this to Singapore. He lived simply but was rich in ideals and principles of what would keep Singapore safe and enable her citizens to survive and thrive.
Mr Lee's gift to us was his ability to carefully sweep the streets of Singapore and then take his place among world leaders to advise and opine on global issues. The strength of a man lies not in his popularity but in his convictions and devotion to the lives of others. For this, Mr Lee, we thank you.
Tham Sai Choy
Chairman, KPMG Asia-Pacific and Managing Partner, KPMG in Singapore
NO DESCRIPTION of Mr Lee Kuan Yew is as meaningful as the ""thank you's"" from the people he led. All of us Singaporeans have everything to thank him for.
Mr Lee was never one to be governed by a short-term view. Beyond leading us to an enviable lifestyle few could imagine at the time, he spent his entire life anchoring our future success. As his fellow countrymen, the best way to honour his life would be to continue his legacy in the lives that we lead, the values that we share and the new heights that we reach.
Honouring his spirit would also mean that we live the Singapore dream not just for our own individual benefit, but for the benefit of all Singaporeans, in keeping with the example that he set for all of us.
Tan Tiong Cheng

AS THE nation grieves the passing of our founding father Mr Lee Kuan Yew, some would think of erecting a grand monument to honour him or even declaring a public holiday day each year in remembrance of him. While his achievements for Singapore were widely known and publicised, many may not know that Mr Lee was also a frugal man who did not indulge in excess.
I recall when Mr Lee gave up golf in the mid-1980s, he sent over a pair of slightly used golf shoes to our late chairman and his friend since Raffles College days, Mr Cheong Thiam Siew. Mr Lee recalled Mr Cheong having the same shoe size and had hoped that the shoes could still be put to good use. That was how frugal that generation was.
As a constant reminder and testament of Mr Lee's spirit of frugality, I think we should conserve Mr Lee's home at 38 Oxley Road as a national monument. While this is a simple house by any standard and cracks were notably visible on the wall, the house is also a place of high historical significance where some of the most important discussions on the future of Singapore were held in the 1950s. More importantly, the house will remind us of Mr Lee in many ways as we honour him for his many contributions and sacrifices to bring Singapore from Third World to First World.
Similar to Mr Lee's ""red box"", which symbolises his unwavering dedication to Singapore in making things better in big and small ways, the house will also serve to remind Singaporeans to strive to build further on the legacy he had left us.

LAST Tuesday, National Parks named a new orchid hybrid the Aranda Lee Kuan Yew, which matches an earlier hybrid, the Vanda Kwa Geok Choo. I have huge admiration for a man who devoted his life to his two great loves - his wife and his country.
His vision was for Singapore to serve as a hub beyond the region, and he shaped our aviation sector, including the daring move to build one of the best international airports at Changi.
New York's John F Kennedy airport was renamed after his death; closer to home, the Philippines has the Ninoy Aquino airport, and Indonesia, the Seokarno-Hatta airport .
As Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said: ""To many Singaporeans, and indeed others too, Lee Kuan Yew was Singapore."" I can't come up with a better tribute than for returning Singaporeans and overseas visitors to land at the Changi Lee Kuan Yew Airport, expected to serve over 130 million passengers annually with T5. It will be a fitting honour for this ""giant of our lifetime"".

MANY leaders come and go. But few have the vision, pragmatism and fortitude to dispense what are ""bitter pills"" necessary for the health and good of a nation. It is only in hindsight that we begin to appreciate the trajectory Mr Lee Kuan Yew was painting for us some 50 years ago. As we mourn the passing of our nation's founding father, it is heartening to see and hear about people from all walks of life express their gratitude and respect for what he has done.
Memorialising his name across the land we call home is an appropriate way to honour Mr Lee and ensure his spirit continues for generations to come. There is a new airport terminal that promises further prosperity for the nation - why not name it after Mr Lee, the same man who made Changi Airport synonymous with ""number one"" for decades? Or dedicate one of the upcoming hospitals or universities to the man? Finally, there is also the birthplace of modern Singapore - the basement room of his Oxley residence. I think it is apt to rename the street after him.

""What I fear is complacency. When things always become better, people tend to want more for less work."" - Mr Lee Kuan Yew
THE best way to honour and preserve Mr Lee's spirit would be to continue building on the legacy that he's left behind - not to waste it, but neither to get complacent and let it stagnate. Even though Singapore has already earned its place on the global stage, the nation should continue to bear the same passion, vindication and drive as Mr Lee to always better ourselves and, for those fortunate to work and live here, to contribute to building a society we can all be proud of.
When Singapore continues on its path of progression, his spirit and the impact of his contributions will continue to be felt for many generations to come. We are truly thankful for this opportunity and it's now our responsibility to nurture the legacy he has left with us.

SINGAPOREANS have the fortune of inheriting a remarkable legacy left by our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. His lifelong abiding dedication to our country and citizens was underpinned by an unwavering belief that Singapore must always seek to be relevant in order to achieve sustainable success - this is true during the nation-building years and even more so in today's highly competitive globalised world.
To best honour the spirit of our founding father will mean remembering the bitter-sweet lessons from our journey to independence to the building of our nation and ""living his spirit"" in our ethos, mindsets and actions. Among the values and ideals that our founding father held, three remain poignantly important. Firstly, it is always about doing the right things, and doing things right. Secondly, to always challenge complacency, set our sights on the future and address issues with pragmatism so as to future-proof Singapore and her people. Thirdly, to build an inclusive and fair society that strives towards the collective good of Singapore notwithstanding inherent differences in our diversity.

WE ARE deeply saddened by the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. A visionary leader, Mr Lee's determination to make this little red dot of ours a shining beacon on the world map was instrumental in building an international stage for Singaporeans and Singapore companies abroad. CapitaLand's success overseas, especially our flagship Raffles City brand of integrated developments, can largely be attributed to Singapore's high international standing. Mr Lee strongly encouraged CapitaLand to export this ""Made in Singapore"" Raffles City concept to other cities in Asia and beyond. He wanted ""Raffles City"" to become another icon for Singapore.
Mr Lee's aspirations set the stage for Singapore over the past 50 years. He has left us with a legacy. CapitaLand will continue to build on it and carry the same passion, dedication and discipline as we journey forward towards the next 50 years and more.

MR LEE Kuan Yew put tiny Singapore on the map for all Singaporeans. He spearheaded Singapore's large-scale industrialisation, transformed it into a garden city and turned it into a global hub. Let us remember to celebrate his achievements even while we grieve his departure. He lived fully until 91 years old.
Our children are never going to experience his wisdom and fighting spirit ""live"" at community events and political rallies but we have this moment to educate them about his place in our lives. Let's do it with joy. That would be the best way to honour his legacy.
Stefan Jacoby

MR LEE Kuan Yew was a truly extraordinary leader who fundamentally transformed Singapore within a generation to an advanced, First World economy and society. Singaporeans can best honour Mr Lee's legacy by continuing this incredible transformation and serving as a leading light for its neighbours across the region.
Building Singapore's generation of prosperity was no accident, and maintaining it into the future cannot be taken for granted. Singapore has earned the right to dream big about the future and has a tradition of hard work and professionalism to make those dreams a reality.
Through innovation and industry, Singapore's greatest asset - its people - can build another generation of prosperity for the nation. And Singapore should build on Mr Lee's role as a global statesman by continuing to set an example for other countries of what can be achieved through reform and stable public administration.

NO WORDS can fully describe the magnitude of what Mr Lee Kuan Yew has done for Singapore. Even as Singapore mourns his passing, we are grateful that we had him for a season, at a time when Singapore needed a man like him. He served Singapore and Singaporeans wholeheartedly, selflessly and gave his all. His success is Singapore's gain.
Indeed, there will not be another like him. The spirit that drove his passions was the love he had for the nation. We can honour this great man by emulating his spirit of servanthood, serving with a genuine heart and in humility, knowing that being blessed with greatness is a blessing to be shared.
Mark Newman

ING Commercial Banking Asia
A SIGNIFICANT legacy of Mr Lee Kuan Yew was how he and his government single-mindedly created an open economy in the early years of Singapore's development that attracted MNCs, creating jobs and a vibrant business hub.
Singapore today is the Asian headquarters of numerous international businesses - ING Bank included. We are here for many reasons of course, but this country's clear rule of law, top-notch infrastructure, transparent economic policies and First World standard of living must rank among the top. Maintaining this global competitive edge of Singapore would be one true mark of lasting respect for Singapore's founding Prime Minister.
Bernold Schroeder
CEO
Pan Pacific Hotels Group
MR LEE Kuan Yew was a giant of a man and leader - in character and spirit; a visionary craftsman who dedicated his life to nation-building. A globally-admired Singapore and the prosperous lives Singaporeans lead today are his ultimate masterpiece.
To honour his life's work, we must invest in securing Singapore's future. Through education and mentorship, let us nurture young Singaporeans to carry the baton with the strength of character, love of country and dedication to the same founding principles of quality leadership, meritocracy, justice and equal opportunity for all.
Mr Lee's legacy should not only be recorded in books but more importantly, live on through the lives of Singaporeans and generations to come. Because he has led the way and shown how one can triumph against all odds in an often turbulent and unpredictable world, we know that Singapore can continue to succeed without him - and she will.

IN SPIRIT, a true Singaporean has a bit of Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian in him or her. And we became this way because of the effort the government took to ensure that all races in Singapore lived together in harmony. We take this for granted but it is a difficult thing to accomplish. This is something we need to continue doing because it is a real gift in these turbulent times.
Meritocracy is also an important legacy that founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew has left behind for us. I have personally benefited from this - I can't think of many places in Asia where I could have started a business as a young woman aged 20 in 1979, but in Singapore I was able to do that and thrive. I owe my business success and global mindset to Singapore and specifically our leader, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

MR LEE Kuan Yew was fiercely committed to Singapore's economic development and social stability, as he guided Singapore through the early years of independence. We have much to learn from his steadfast vision to turn Singapore from what he called a ""mudflat"" to the thriving metropolis today and also his intrepid spirit to never be daunted by having to take ""uncharted roads, face impassable mountains, cross treacherous rivers, (and) be blocked by landslides and earthquakes"".
Keep the remarkable Singapore brand going - one that boasts political and economic stability, a strong workforce and efficient machinery. Train our sights on the future - be open to opportunities, innovate and keep ourselves relevant. Be singularly dogged in pursuing our vision, driven by our unwavering belief. Keep Singapore the eclectic, multi-cultural mix it is today.
Mr Lee gave up his life building Singapore. We must continue Mr Lee's vision and legacy, and keep Singapore exceptional.
Janet Ang

MR LEE Kuan Yew is the architect and strategist who transformed Singapore to what it has become today - a multi-cultural and thriving metropolis, a global business and financial centre, and a First World country on its way to becoming a Smart Nation. He instilled a culture of clean governance and efficient productivity, and inspired Singaporeans in all walks of life to do our very best.
In honour of his spirit of discipline, hard work and determination, we need to commit ourselves to building local capability and future-ready skills that will enable us to continue to add value to the global economy and ensure that Singaporeans will continually enjoy better jobs, better homes and a better life, for the next 50 years and beyond.
To quote an old productivity jingle which I grew up with: ""Good, better, best! Never let it rest. Till your good is better and your better, best!""

MR LEE Kuan Yew's great achievement was the creation of modern Singapore. His greatest achievement is that it will survive him. This is what he worked for tirelessly. We will demonstrate the respect we all feel for a truly great leader and an exceptional public servant if we do not take the quality of life we have for granted. This is a very special country. It deserves to be protected and sustained.
Singapore is a beacon of light in a troubled world. We are all so fortunate to live in a clean, safe, multi-racial society where there is mutual respect and tolerance. We have clean water, enough food, good healthcare, clean government and plenty of opportunities to succeed in life. Pause for a moment and think how many millions of our fellow human beings across the world don't have our quality of life. Let's appreciate it and sustain it.

MR LEE Kuan Yew is a father to all Singaporeans. He lived his life for us, disciplining us when we were errant, inspiring us to continuously do our best, and taking hard decisions even when they hurt, just so that Singapore can continue to be the best that it can be. Now that he is gone, we feel the loss so immensely. As a nation, let's pull ourselves together to perpetuate his forward-looking vision and build on the legacy that he has left us.
Singaporeans, let's continue to create an innovative and adaptive Singapore to stay relevant in this new age. Let's step out to contribute ideas in our respective areas of specialisation so that we can sustain a diversity of growth sectors. We must ensure that Singapore can and will continue to succeed in the years to come, as a fitting tribute to this man who gave his life to the country. Finally, a very sincere ""thank you"" to the Prime Minister and his family, for sharing their beloved Papa with the nation for the last 50 years.

I HAD the privilege of living here in Singapore in the early 1960s and I well remember the prevailing gloom and despondency when the separation from the then-newly formed Malaysia occurred. The whole atmosphere was one of depression and it was Mr Lee's tenacity and selfless dedication that pulled the nation together against all the odds. It is true to say the pessimists at that time far outnumbered the optimists.
Because of his steadfast drive and energy, the vibrant Singapore we live in today is totally unrecognisable from the rather run down Oriental seaport it was when I arrived here. So to honour Mr Lee's legacy and show our gratitude for what he achieved for us over half a century, we simply have to stay focused, maintain the momentum he created and continue to believe in ourselves and our ability to succeed. We will never see his like again.

DOES size matter? Mr Lee Kuan Yew had the vision of a great Singapore, in a world not yet global. He successfully re-invented (at least twice) the city state and made Singapore both a benchmark in Asia and an inspiration for many.

THE best way for Singapore to honour what Mr Lee has done for us is to continue being innovative as a nation, to strive towards increasing our productivity as intensely as he has focused on our rapid growth as a nation.
In our actions, whether as individuals or as businesses, to be resourceful and adaptable in building upon this great foundation that he has established so well for us all.

UNDER his able and honest leadership, Mr Lee Kuan Yew has transformed Singapore from a Third World to First World country. I have lived through this transformation and am a great beneficiary of his great achievement. In the 1950s, I lived in a kampong that had no piped water nor electricity. We used a bucket toilet until 1975. Today, I live in a house and have a comfortable life.
So we should honour his contribution, and in so doing it would also serve as a reminder to Singaporeans that it is good, honest, able leadership and hard work that brought us success as a nation, and that we must maintain the same virtues so that future generations of Singaporeans can live comfortably and meaningfully.
These are my recommendations:
1. Set up a Lee Kuan Yew museum to house ""mementos"" of his life's work and achievements, including all the tributes from world leaders and Singaporeans received at his passing.
2. Rename Changi Airport, Lee Kuan Yew Airport.
3. Set up Lee Kuan Yew scholarships for every course of study in our four universities, for students from households with less than S$5,000 monthly income.
4. Erect his statues in key locations across Singapore.

MR LEE Kuan Yew's vision for a multi-cultural and diverse city-state was realised through his pioneering spirit and boldness. His approach helped foster an ideal environment in which people and companies from all backgrounds and cultures could thrive - and all for the benefit of the country he so dearly loved. The result of his influential leadership and decisive action is that a geographically-diminutive nation is now a giant of business, finance, education and culture, among other areas.
He is the driving reason that Insead is here today, working with companies and their executives to further build upon Singapore's strong business foundations. To honour this founding father, it is incumbent upon us all to continue to embrace diversity and innovation, as he did, to contribute to the greater good of society, as he did, and to remain committed to the development of our greatest asset: people.

MR LEE Kuan Yew was a man with a vision and the passion to pursue it with a single-minded focus. He had the mental strength and worked extremely hard throughout his active career. If every Singaporean adopts any one of these qualities as her or his own, we would be honouring our founding father's spirit and at the same time doing ourselves a favour.
Mr Lee was a man who started with a small island bereft of natural resources and turned it into a First World country. This should inspire each of us to take what we have and make what we want to of it. We need to take even more pride in our country than we currently do or show, and continue electing capable leaders who can build further on the fabulous platform that we have inherited from him. If we can truly say that the best is yet to be for Singapore, and make it happen, we would make him proud!

WE HAVE lost a great leader and founder. Singapore is where it is today due to the foresight of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team. Mr Lee had a vision for a better life for Singaporeans and dedicated his life to this cause. Despite hardship and turmoil during the early years, Mr Lee led our forefathers to build a nation that is peaceful, resilient and harmonious.
While we grieve the loss of Mr Lee, we also celebrate his life, achievements and legacy. The best way to honour Mr Lee and live his legacy is to pass on lessons he taught us to future generations and instil in them the values of discipline, honesty and determination.

WESTERN Digital joins Singaporeans and the world as we mourn the loss of Singapore's founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. A great man and exemplary leader, he will forever be respected and remembered for the significant impact he had on Asia and the world.
The economic transformation and development Mr Lee set in motion for Singapore 50 years ago has allowed it to become one of the world's greatest economic success stories. Western Digital, through its HGST and WD subsidiaries, has had roots in Singapore for more than two decades. With a large base of engineering talent, strong customer support capabilities, and a supportive environment for doing business, Singapore has played a strategic role in the company's ongoing growth in the region.
To honour Mr Lee's legacy, Singaporeans need to uphold the pioneering spirit he set in place 50 years ago and to continue striving for excellence, so that Singapore continues to be a strategic business hub and the port of call for technology firms around the region.

BUILDER, Salesman and Guardian - these were the hats that our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew wore on his journey to building Singapore from a fishing port to a thriving metropolis. Everything we see, touch, experience was built from scratch in all sectors covering business, defence, education, environment, transport and housing.
And he led by example, even planting trees to give us a green Singapore. His wisdom was sought by world and business leaders. He put this to our advantage by marketing Singapore as a haven for business, investments and all manner of political, economic, cultural and social collaboration, thus making Singapore the capital city of the Asian century.
Everybody acknowledges him as the Father of Singapore. Yet he was more than that - he was our guardian angel. Every waking moment of his life, he thought, cared and acted in the interests of all citizens. The racial harmony we have today is the envy of many countries. We should not take all these achievements for granted. Therefore, to honour his legacy, we should be even more united as Singaporeans and ride any uncertainties in the future together regardless of race, language or religion and social status. Truly a great leader for Singapore, his passing is a sad loss for Singaporeans.

THOSE who have worked, lived or even just travelled aboard would probably understand that our economic success and what we have today in Singapore is exceptional. The stability, global influence, and credibility that we have today took us 50 years to build. It certainly did not happen by chance. It is through sheer courage, hard work, perseverance and strong leadership by our late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
The global environment of today is characterised by rapid technological advancements. We are bombarded by information overload from many fronts and we now have connectivity 24/7 across the globe. What happens in the eurozone will impact the rest of the world, including Singapore. To ensure continued success in Singapore, we need the highest standards of integrity, adaptability, flexibility and agility to respond quickly to a changing environment. We must be entrepreneurial and have a global outlook and, just as importantly, strong integrity and good communication skills. Like Mr Lee, one who is authentic and embodies integrity, conviction and passion will naturally draw loyal followers.
Michael Zink
Head of Asean and Citi Country Officer, Singapore
THE founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew put in place the foundations of Singapore's development from a Third World nation into an economic miracle that it is today. Modern Singapore has one of the highest GDP per capita, clear rule of law, low crime rates and a well-educated talent pool. All these have earned Singapore the reputation as one of the leading business and financial markets in the world.
The success of the nation was not only built on a clear vision but also on hard work, discipline, resilience and a belief in meritocracy. These are the values that will enable Singapore to have many more years of success in the future.

For this reason, Mr Lee Kuan Yew's defence of postal workers as a lawyer in the 1950s touched me deeply. It showed his concern for the common man, in this case the postal workers. What was to make an even greater impact on me was how, even when he had become Prime Minister, he was still prepared to reach out, and to listen.
In 1971, I was invited, along with members of the Singapore Planning and Urban Research Group, to have dinner with him at the Istana. He made time to listen to us - a group of architects, urban planners, lawyers and sociologists - and to discuss ideas for the development of Singapore.
That same preparedness to listen carried through over the decades. In 1995, I had the opportunity to present the design of Esplanade - Theatres by the Bay to him and the other members of the Cabinet. Although he was initially uncertain that Singapore was ready for a major arts centre and to allocate a large budget for its development, he was prepared to listen. He was eventually persuaded by his colleagues.
These experiences made a deep impression on me: A great man who, despite his intellect and farsightedness, still made time to listen and to learn.

INDEED, the nation suffered a great loss with the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Mr Lee dedicated his life to building Singapore into the prosperous nation we are today. His inspiring leadership and acute judgement laid the foundations for the successful Singapore we know and love.
Mr Lee never had any tolerance for corruption, and was relentless in his pursuit to weed out all forms of corruption with strict rules and regulations. While some might not agree with such a stringent form of governance, the thriving economy and prosperity that Singapore enjoys today stand as testaments to his wisdom of building our economy on high ethical standards. With rising temptation and threat of fraud and corruption in today's complex business environment, we can take reference from Mr Lee's firm beliefs and commitment in upholding integrity and ethics in all that we do.
Therefore, let us honour Mr Lee by continuing to build on his illustrious legacy in this and other aspects of building our nation into a beautiful and nurturing home for all Singaporeans. Even as the world moves on, we shall always remember him as the steadfast and resolute leader who placed Singapore on the world map as a shining beacon of Asia.

IF there are four words to describe the spirit of founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, I think they would be Ambitious, Brave, Caring and Decisive. Therefore, we Singaporeans can best honour his spirit as follows:
Be Ambitious: We must make Singapore the best in the world (if not the region) and think of creative and fresh ways to do so.
Be Brave: Once we identify the ways to make Singapore the best, we must have the courage to achieve them and see them through.
Be Caring: As we strive to be the best, we must not forget our humanity, our people and their feelings.
Be Decisive: As we seek to be the best, be brave for the journey and be caring for our people, let us never turn back but keep striving unstintingly for a brighter future because the best is yet to be.
Majulah Singapore!

SINGAPORE has lost our dear founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew but he has left behind an extraordinary legacy. Through his vision, leadership, determination and courage, he turned Singapore from a tiny island with no natural resources into a global economic powerhouse.
Mr Lee believes deeply in the rule of law and that good governance needs leaders with the right values. He is a strong advocate of education and talent development and encourages upgrading and lifelong learning. Our future generations can best honour him by upholding these values and carrying on his legacy, one that is built on the foundation of honesty, integrity, commitment and responsibility, and doing the right thing all the time.

WE are deeply saddened at the passing of Singapore's first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Mr Lee dedicated his life to improving the lives of Singaporeans. He faced tremendous challenges but had the courage of his convictions, immense intellect and the sheer force of will, to succeed.
Unilever, like Singapore, owes him a great debt. When Unilever first opened our office here in 1953, Singapore was only a small trading centre. Today, we hire several hundred Singaporeans here; Unilever Singapore is now a critical global hub and home to our global leadership development centre, Four Acres. Without Mr Lee's pro-investment policies, we would not be where we are today.
Even as we mourn his passing, we are also determined to honour his legacy. This means remembering not only where we have come from, but also where we are going to - an even brighter future for Singapore. At Unilever, we will continue to work with Singapore to invest in talent and build key capabilities here. We have no doubt that the Singapore model Mr Lee has built will stand the test of time when we work together.

MR LEE Kuan Yew was our Founding Entrepreneur. His political entrepreneurship was of a higher calibre and impact in the creation and structuring of our country. His vision, leadership, courage, risk-taking, attention to details and care for all Singaporeans are traits we all should aspire to.
In the last two weeks, the media has highlighted the spirit of Mr Lee. This must be captured and not allowed to dissipate over time. We should record his contributions and achievements in our heritage and teach our young about him. We should build a Centre of Learning in his name for outreach, teaching and research. This will keep the spirit of Mr Lee alive in all our hearts for posterity.
The baton has been passed to the next generation to make Singapore an even better place. We are confident we can forge ahead and build on the firm foundation that he has laid. With diligence, cohesiveness and enterprise, a better future lies ahead.
Johan deVilliers
Country Managing Director
ABB in Singapore
ABB has grown from humble beginnings to a sizeable company and we are honoured to have played a role in the development of this country under Mr Lee's leadership. The best way to honour his spirit is to live and breathe his very own words.
Mr Lee once said: ""What I fear is complacency. When things always become better, people tend to want more for less work."" We owe it to the founding father to keep his legacy alive, to continue the hard work that he has started, and to continue to build Singapore as a strong and successful nation. As Singapore emerges from its loss, we have the power to build on his foundation, strive for his ideals, and create a city and society that he would be proud of.

""LEE Kuan Yew"" or ""LKY"" represents values of resilience, diligence, honesty, thrift, loyalty, family man and many more. These values empowered Mr Lee to turn impossibilities to possibilities. It turned our little red dot to a bright red dot. This brightness must continue to shine for many, many more years. If only we can live up to even just a portion of the ""LKY"" values, not only will we be a better person but it will ensure the continued success of Singapore.
I would propose a ""LKY Day"" to always remember this great man and, more importantly, the values he represent. There should be programmes to educate the young and the old to practise the ""LKY"" values. This will not only ensure Singaporeans remember the values of our founding father, but also that the world will recognise and learn from his values.
Eric Lim
President
Institute of Internal Auditors Singapore
THE deluge of accolades and tributes from Singaporeans and world leaders for Singapore's first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, is testament to the deep respect people have for him. Mr Lee's uncompromising principles on strong governance, the rule of law, his intolerant position towards corruption and inefficiency all contributed to the nation's rapid economic growth. He ensured that all the ""stones"" or foundations needed in building a government were based on justice, integrity and meritocracy, all of which were aligned perfectly with his principles. To honour Mr Lee's legacy, these must remain in government to ensure that we sustain a corruption-free environment where fraud and risks are kept at manageable levels in order for Singapore to remain a successful nation.
We suggest moments of silence to be observed in all National Day-related events this year to honour the dedication, sacrifice and brilliance of Mr Lee. He was a remarkable and irreplaceable statesman who will be missed beyond words.

MR LEE Kuan Yew's values and beliefs, which he so passionately taught us as Singapore's founding leader, are the cornerstone of his life. With a great vision and purpose to make Singapore a better place, Mr Lee imparted to us his values of courage, diplomacy, diligence, responsibility, righteousness, perseverance, as well as love for his family and fellow Singaporeans. Thus, I believe the best way to honour Mr Lee is to live our lives well, in a way that would make him proud, and contribute to the growth and future of Singapore.
Cheng Heng Chew

American Express
I FEEL that the best way for Singapore to honour Mr Lee Kuan Yew's spirit and legacy is to adopt his tireless attitude and conviction to pursue development while never losing sight of where we've come from. Singapore is a multi-cultural society with towering skyscrapers dotting the skyline. Yet, in spite of various urban development projects, care has always been given to the preservation of the shared heritage of our diverse communities.
Cultural understanding has always been an important pillar in Singapore and should continue to retain its importance as Singapore matures. To this end, American Express is committed to contributing to the sustenance of Singapore's heritage. It is truly one of the best ways in which we can honour the memory of Mr Lee and the generation that built the city that we proudly call home.
Loh Khai Peng
Managing Director, HP Singapore, and
General Manager, HP Enterprise Group, Singapore
IN the years following the Singapore's independence, Mr Lee Kuan Yew actively encouraged inward investment from multinational corporations, as part of his vision for the social and economic transformation of the state. Indeed, HP was one of the first multinationals to set up in Singapore, with the establishment of the company's operations in Redhill 45 years ago.
We can honour his spirit by continuing to position Singapore as one of the most attractive destinations in the world, for top-class talent and for international business. This can be achieved through a continued focus on state-of-the-art infrastructural development, the ongoing nurturing of an educated workforce, and maintaining efficient government and regulatory structures. Ultimately, maintaining Singapore's leadership position in the Asia-Pacific region will be the most effective way of maintaining his legacy in the years to come.

VISA joins the nation in mourning the loss of an inspirational leader. Our founding father Lee Kuan Yew's lifelong contributions have placed Singapore in a solid position on the world map. I believe the best way to honour Mr Lee's spirit is to build on one of his greatest accomplishments - maintaining regional political stability and racial harmony. This strong foundation will enable Singapore to become an important commercial and cultural hub, connecting the West to the rest of Asian countries.
As Singaporeans, we should uphold the values that our founding father had instilled in us and held to high standards - meritocracy, honesty and pragmatism. Every Singaporean should continue to evolve these values, embracing meritocracy with compassion, honesty with magnanimity, and pragmatism with creativity. Singaporeans have come together in solidarity and showed the world that we are united as one nation in this time of grief. I believe that as long as we stay united and work towards the progress of our country as one people, our generations will continue to benefit for many years to come.

I HAVE always admired Mr Lee Kuan Yew for his wonderful foresight. From opening up the country to foreign investment, to building a green city - he has always been a visionary with a plan. His ability to execute his grand plans for the country has led to many successes that Singapore has enjoyed over the years.
If we, as a nation and as individuals, can embrace this forward-looking mindset, we would be able to build on the foundations that he laid to keep Singapore successful into the future. That, in my opinion, is the best way to honour Mr Lee's spirit and legacy.
Ng Joo Hee

PUB
SINGAPORE has lost our founding father, and PUB, the architect of our water story.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew recognised, from day one, that water security would be nothing less than existential for Singapore. He had famously said: ""Water dominated every other policy. Every other policy had to bend at the knees for water survival.""
Mr Lee was acutely aware of Singapore's dependence on imported water, and worked tirelessly to secure this lifeline. He was clear that we needed to find alternatives, and challenged the PUB to collect every drop of rain that falls on Singapore. That led to a massive cleaning up of our polluted waterways in order to turn them into water catchments. The most polluted of these were, of course, the Singapore River and the Kallang Basin.
Today, the Marina Barrage keeps the sea out of Marina Reservoir, Singapore's 15th reservoir, which holds 10 per cent of our fresh water. Today, two-thirds of Singapore is water catchment, and we have reliable alternative sources in desalinated water and NEWater. Today, Singapore is a world leader in water husbandry and Singaporean water companies bring class-leading capabilities to the global marketplace.
Every one of us in PUB owes it to Mr Lee to ensure that Singapore will never ever go thirsty.
John Keung Kam Yin
CEO
Building and Construction Authority
MR LEE Kuan Yew had dedicated his entire life to shaping Singapore into the highly liveable and cosmopolitan city it is today. He worked hard to set Singapore on a trajectory of success. As a visionary leader, he paid a lot of attention to detail on building this city and its infrastructure to meet our immediate and long-term socio-economic needs. For instance, he had the great foresight to make environmental protection and sustainability hallmarks of Singapore's development, enabling Singapore to be an environmentally-friendly metropolis. He also believed in building an inclusive society and meeting the rising aspirations of Singaporeans. These have laid the foundation for us to create a future-ready built environment.
The best way for all of us to honour and remember Mr Lee is by doing our best to continue his dream of making sure that Singapore is always ready for the future and protecting the country's long-term interests. The built environment sector and BCA will continue to play our part in championing a future-ready built environment to support Singapore's progress and enable our citizens to fulfil their aspirations.

Centurion Corporation Limited
SINGAPORE owes much of our survival and prosperity to Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team. Because of his vision, wisdom and tenacity, Mr Lee overcame the odds and rallied Singaporeans to build a nation that has become one of the world's great economic success stories. Along the way, Mr Lee had to make many tough decisions, including opening our doors to bring in foreign workers to complement our labour supply. As one of Singapore's largest workers accommodation operators, Centurion Corporation's tribute to Mr Lee is to continue working with the government to make Singapore a ""home away from home"" for these foreign workers.
The best way that Singaporeans can honour Mr Lee is to truly live up to our National Pledge as one united people; to build a society based on justice and equality, regardless of race, language or religion, so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation.
John Lim

ARA Asset Management Limited
MR LEE Kuan Yew fought hard his whole life to make Singapore not only successful, but exceptional. His vision put Singapore on the world map, commanding the respect of many world leaders. He paved the way for many Singapore enterprises going overseas, thanks to the nation's reputation for excellence, professionalism, efficiency and non-corruptness. As a local company with businesses in the region, this is something that ARA is very thankful for.
I hope Singapore enterprises can honour his spirit by continuing to fly the Singapore flag high as we bring our businesses beyond our shores, and uphold the excellent image of Singapore he has built through our business dealings and operations in other countries.
Dhirendra Shantilal
Board Director & Head of Asia Pacific
Fircroft
MR LEE Kuan Yew was not content to let Singapore be just another nation; he wanted it to be an exceptional nation. Unbridled ambition and relentless personal development but more than anything else, what defined Mr Lee was his endless desire to reach, to strive and achieve. Where others would have puzzled over how to keep this little rock afloat, he sought to make it one of the richest nations in the world, and succeeded.
Confronted with powerful neighbours and uncertain times, he didn't work for survival but to create one of the best equipped, most prepared and powerful militaries in the region. He wanted Singapore to lead the world in education, governance, science and finance - and this desire for excellence shone through too in his personal life.
His academic results were consistently outstanding, and throughout his life he would keep learning and achieving; he gave his all for Singapore. We can honour his spirit by continuing to strive for the apparently unattainable, and by giving our all. We've come a long way but we can go much further - if we follow the example set by Mr Lee.

IT IS our collective duty as Singaporeans to protect the legacy of our founding Prime Minister. As we march into the future, let us honour his spirit by staying true to values which he held dearly throughout his service to our people and our nation - honesty, integrity, courage, determination and dedication.

MR LEE possessed the rarest combination of intellect and conviction which made him an outstanding and admirable statesman the world has ever known. He was not only exceptionally adept in acquiring a globalised view on socio-economics and political developments, but was also unwaveringly dedicated to serving the country's best interests. Mr Lee was determined and resilient in overcoming obstacles, and was distinguished for his discerning foresight.
With strong foundations laid under his leadership, these qualities are today synonymous with Singapore. It is important for Singapore and the workforce here to continue striving for excellence and pushing the envelope, which I think will prove to be the best way in carrying on his legacy and ensuring Singapore's success going forward.

THE demise of Singapore's founding father Mr Lee Kuan Yew is a personal reminder of the Chinese phrase yin shui si yuan, which means: When you drink water, think of its source, and remember where and how the water came about.
The miraculous transformation of Singapore from mudflats to metropolis is built upon a set of foundational core values advocated by Mr Lee and his team - including passion, integrity and respect. These are key attributes that every nation, company and individual will do well to abide by.
It is without a doubt that throughout his adult life, Mr Lee was constantly putting the interests of Singapore first. In my opinion, the best way to honour this great leader and statesman would be to continue his vision of growing Singapore and Singaporeans. The best form of remembrance for Mr Lee would be for everyone to work at sustaining Singapore's success in the coming years, guided by passion, integrity, respect, and above all, gratitude.
We are thankful for all that Mr Lee has done, and the legacy that he has left behind. With this in mind, let us strive to create a better Singapore for all of us.

OUR founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew had done more than words could ever describe. He dedicated more than 50 years of his life, putting the nation ahead of himself, to bring Singapore to where it is today. Having had the privilege to grow up in the years when Singapore was under his leadership, I saw the changes in the quality of life we had, the career opportunities we had. Singapore is now a place that we're all proud to call home.
The best way that Singapore can honour Mr Lee, in my opinion, is to continue to be united as a nation regardless of our differences and to continue his legacy and philosophy to grow this little red dot we call home, together.
Tan Chong Huat
Managing Partner
RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP
WE can honour the spirit of Mr Lee Kuan Yew by embracing ""Singapore's destiny"" - the legacy that Mr Lee had tirelessly strived for in his life's work.
In 2011, he envisioned Singapore as ""a fun place, a buzzling commercial and economic centre"", and foresaw us taking a quantum leap in the next 20 years. By this, he had meant that ""investors have absolute confidence in us (that Singapore) is stable, the government is stable, the labour and industrial situation is stable"". He had also referred to the two integrated resorts, F1, etc - and all these have come to fruition.
In addition, we must ensure that we continue to build ""a hundred storeys building on strong foundation"" by having ""strong finance and defence established in a strong, unified, well-educated and increasingly cohesive society"". These words were spoken by Mr Lee when he was coping with the frailties of age and out of his abiding concern for the future generation. We shall do well to imbibe his wisdom to heart.

HOW best to honour Mr Lee Kuan Yew, a man among giants.
A hero in the league of legends.
In Singaporeans' minds and hearts, his place assured.
His whole life was for Singapore, prosperity ensured.
Stamford Raffles found Singapore.
Lee Kuan Yew built Singapore.
He was a man made of sterner stuff
Not befitting of any flowery fluff.
He came, he built, he is remembered
Forever as Singapore's founding father.
Chong Kee Sen
President
The Institution of Engineers, Singapore
MR LEE Kuan Yew, the founding father of modern Singapore, was an exceptional, pragmatic visionary who made dreams come true. He may not have been trained as an engineer but had great faith in our engineers to fulfil his vision in developing sustainable public housing, building world-class sea and air hubs, building the mass rapid transit system, advancing the manufacturing industry, greening the city and even transforming our once-filthy rivers into sources of drinking water.
He engineered our country's successes and we owe our prosperity, security and peace to him and his team.
Singapore has lost a great man but his legacy will inspire us to build upon the foundation that he laid, continue to innovate beyond expectations, and keep on challenging and advancing technology for a better society.
Bek Kheng Lee
Managing Director
Azen Manufacturing Pte Ltd
A GREAT Leader, A Great Husband, A Great Father - in summary, A Great Man. We can best honour Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew by emulating the examples that he has set, be it in his professional or personal life.
Professionally, he dedicated himself wholeheartedly towards nation building, and did an excellent job. He had exceptional clarity of mind, which gave him the courage to make decisions that might not have been popular but would certainly benefit Singaporeans in the long run. I particularly salute him for his tough stance on eradicating corruption.
In his personal life, Mr Lee's acts of love and commitment to his wife and children show that family was of utmost importance to him. Family forms the building block of a healthy society, and Mr Lee's devotion to his loved ones despite his heavy commitments in politics makes him a role model for all of us.
Michael Smith
Country Director
Randstad Singapore
MR LEE Kuan Yew had a steadfast vision for Singapore. He transformed the country into a global economic powerhouse with strong productivity growth, where people have secure jobs and enjoy one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world.
Mr Lee's push for the concept of tripartism where the government, unions and employers work together, has made Singapore one of the world's leading economies, boasting harmonious labour relations.
To best honour Mr Lee, it is important that we continue working under this tripartite umbrella to further develop Singapore's world-class workforce, attract and develop high-calibre talent and enhance productivity to benefit the lives of all Singaporeans.
With this, Singapore can continue to be well-prepared to overcome complex economic challenges, retain its place on the world stage and realise Mr Lee's vision well into the future.
Adaire Fox-Martin

SAP Asia Pacific Japan
MR LEE Kuan Yew was a great visionary who saw the possibilities for Singapore five decades ago when few could. Together with the pioneer generation of Singaporeans he laid the foundation for Singapore to be a thriving international business hub with sustainable economic growth.
The excellent infrastructure and efficient system in Singapore attracted many multinational corporations, including SAP, to establish their regional headquarters here to manage their business in this part of the world. His achievements draw awe from leaders around the world, and he is both a role model and inspiration for business leaders. I am inspired by his ability to align an entire nation around the execution of the vision ""from Third World to First"". Mr Lee's achievements and vision will continue to inspire the generations that follow. On behalf of SAP, I extend our deepest condolences to the family of Mr Lee.

A LONG-OVERDUE letter to our founding father:
Dear Mr Lee
Words cannot describe the depth of my gratitude for all that you have done for Singapore, and indeed the world. Words too cannot describe the immense grief I feel at your passing. And yet we have never met. Such is the magnitude of your life achievements. Everywhere I look, you have touched our lives - from our skyscrapers, world-class airport, beautiful gardens, water reservoirs, to our very own defence force, a robust, corruption-free economy and a First World education system ... the list goes on. Against all odds, you have put Singapore on the world map. Thank you. It is now up to us to honour your legacy and relentless spirit. We have in part become victims of our own success - with rising affluence, we have mellowed and allowed ourselves and our younger generation to become soft. We have to ""man up"". Together.
You followed your vision. You were true to your course. You never gave up. You innovated. You led with a firm hand. And yet you cared. To honour you, we should endeavour to do likewise. To always work towards our aspirations, like you did. We should be relentless in our pursuits. Like you were. Lead firmly, and yet, remember to listen to our hearts. Like you did. This way, we honour you and your spirit. And we keep our Red Dot on the world map.
Your Singapore daughter.

ALL of us at the Ong Radio Group are deeply saddened by the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Founded in 1929, we have been most privileged to experience his visionary leadership first-hand. We saw how he fought for our independence, instilled a sense of unity among our pioneering population and transformed our nation from Third to First World in a single generation.
While Singapore's 50th jubilee will not be the same without Mr Lee, Singapore can best honour Mr Lee's eminent spirit by keeping his vision alive, building on his legacy, and raising the quality of life for all. The adoption of smart technology will give us ample opportunities to do so; it will enable us to design and build better homes for families, create more sustainable and productive workplaces and help individuals realise their dreams by plugging into the potential of a more connected, and integrated world.
Peter Schwartz
Senior Vice-President
Salesforce
WE AT Salesforce join the millions of others who are mourning the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He is undoubtedly the greatest man I have ever met. His ability to bring together vision, intelligence, practical reality and integrity was unique and the results show in modern Singapore.
Through his steadfast dedication, he has shaped Singapore to be the first-rate capital for a myriad of industries around the world, and has set the country on the path towards building a smarter nation for all. This is a future made possible by the advanced ICT infrastructures and policies already set in place, which enables and encourages both public and private sector entities towards adopting smart technologies.
In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of enterprises moving to adopt Mr Lee's progressive vision for a smarter, better Singapore through the integration of innovative solutions and technologies. By holding fast to his pioneering spirit in all that we do, companies can build on the legacy Mr Lee left us, and continue towards an even greater future in the next 50 years.

FROM Brunei to Botswana, the international accolades flowed.
From businessmen to bloggers, the domestic gratitude showed.
It was indeed an unforgettable week where heartfelt tributes rained effusively in honour of the man who made modern Singapore.
We saw examples of how many, many Singaporeans performed deeds seldom heard of previously. Grateful individuals resiliently joining queues way past midnight to pay their last respects despite warnings that the queueing time would stretch to several hours. Small businesses offering complimentary drinks to refresh those in queue, out of their own goodwill. A people united in grief, with many galvanised into action.
In a week of immense sorrow, the positive energies displayed convey hope for tomorrow. This is important because however much we think we have arrived as a nation, I personally believe the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew would feel we remain a ""work in progress"".
Thus, for those who can and wish to repay their debt of gratitude to Mr Lee, the act really starts now. Continue to work hard and/or work smart. There can be no respite. Majulah Singapura!
Chris Comer

MR LEE Kuan Yew was a giant among men, and one of the last true great statesmen of our times. His spirit of hard work, discipline, resourcefulness, and forward thinking showed the world that an unlikely struggling nation with a vision can rise to the top through sheer determination. Continuing to uphold Mr Lee's values as Singapore progresses will ensure that his spirit will live on for generations to come.
The late founding Prime Minister was and will continue to be an inspiration to every aspect of Singapore. No matter how difficult the circumstances, or how small we may be, he showed us that we can achieve beyond expectations, having brought this little island from Third World to First within a generation. Be it through successful times or inclement economic weather, possessing forward-looking determination and commitment to achieving a dream will continue to open doors for Singapore in the future - what Mr Lee strived to do his entire life.

MR LEE Kuan Yew's legacy is our greatest inheritance. The work that he had done through his life has left us with a Singapore that is not only regarded as a role model but one that is also highly respected for its robust and transparent economy and governance.
It's his policies that brought about the stable economic growth of Singapore, a huge reason that contributed to SGPMX being headquartered in Singapore. In fact, I cannot think of a better country in Asia where we can thrive in.
Nando Cesarone

MR LEE Kuan Yew believed in the values of hard work, determination and foresight - attributes that have transformed Singapore to a key financial and logistics hub in Asia and the world. Singapore's economic success today is built on integrity, strong work ethics, corporate innovation and transparent governance. UPS is privileged to serve our customers in this robust business environment.
Integrity is vital in doing business and a strong contributor to success. Companies and individuals can honour Mr Lee's legacy every day by conducting business fairly, honestly and ethically, while driving the same spirit of innovation. Having astute business acumen, exemplifying a can-do attitude and always doing the right thing are ways we can all live up to the values Mr Lee espoused as he led Singapore to be a leading economy on the global stage.
Nirvik Singh
Chairman & CEO
Grey Group Asia Pacific
FOUNDING Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was a visionary statesman with the qualities of imagination, persistence, conviction and pragmatism. His legacy - racial harmony, a world-class education system, infrastructure with a ""smart nation"" ecosystem, and decades of economic growth - has made Singapore one of the most attractive and admired cities in Asia today. He also created a transparent judiciary with zero tolerance for corruption - all within a framework of encouraging meritocracy.
This lifetime achievement of nation-building has led Singapore into becoming the powerhouse it is today. The people of Singapore can continue to build upon this solid foundation and achieve even greater heights predicted by the man who saw tomorrow.
I think a good way to honour Mr Lee would be to rename Changi Airport the Lee Kuan Yew International Airport.

THE passing our founding father definitely leaves a sense of emptiness for many of us who experienced the transformation of Singapore from Third World to First. The best tribute we could give to the man who gave it all to put us on the world map is to embrace his undying spirit of entrepreneurialism and to always leapfrog the norms.
We need to continue asking ourselves: What we need to do to stay ahead? What tough decisions do we need to make to ensure that we continue to put the company and our country ahead of our individual needs? There isn't a need for us to be popular. But we need to be effective with our approach. As he once said: ""You must be able to soar above reality and say, 'This is also possible' - a sense of imagination.""
Matthieu Destot
Vice-President of Sales for Asia Pacific
Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise
MR LEE Kuan Yew will always be respected and remembered by the international community for his success in transforming Singapore into the thriving metropolis it is today. It is the most connected city in Asia, powered by the best-educated population anywhere in the world. These achievements offer Alcatel Lucent Enterprise, a firm believer in Singapore, the opportunity to harness the nation's infrastructure, its talent pool and the spirit of its pioneering businessmen, especially among small and medium businesses.
As the world mourns with Singapore, perhaps the best way to honour the spirit of her founding Prime Minister is to embody his unyielding will to not just survive, but thrive. He brought Singapore into the First World from Third. Let us build on that momentum and steer Singapore well into the future of a smart world.
Neeraj Swaroop
CEO, Singapore
Standard Chartered Bank
STANDARD Chartered Bank was first established here in 1859 and we bear witness to the progress that has taken place especially in the last 50 years. It was the late Mr Lee's extraordinary vision, leadership and statesmanship that transformed Singapore into the entrepot port, advanced manufacturing and petrochemical hub, and finally the international financial and services centre that it is today.
While we should take pride in Singapore's economic success and global influence, the thing that struck me the most is the basis that he had built this nation on - that Singapore citizens are one united people, regardless of race, language or religion. This is clearly evident as we watch and read about thousands of people who queued up to pay respects to Mr Lee. There are people who gave out water to those in the queue, offered snacks in the middle of the night. When asked who they are, their response was: ""I'm Singaporean."" This is one great nation that has shown that united as one people, even the impossible can be achieved. I believe this is the spirit that Mr Lee had built and all of us have been reminded of. May his legacy live on for generations to come.

ON BEHALF of Diageo and our employees in Singapore, we offer all residents and citizens of Singapore our deepest condolences upon the sad passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
As the founding father of Singapore, his vision and achievements have proved a remarkable example to governments and people all over the world. Under his leadership, Singapore has become a dynamic, open economy, creating the conditions for success, and has transformed itself time and again to attract the right global investment, building a centre of excellence for industries in IT, biomedical science, financial services, and entertainment among many others.
Looking to the future, Singapore needs to continue with this fearless and bold transformation by charting new frontiers. His legacy calls for us all to continue innovating and to keep working for the best in our business and in ourselves.
Sidney Lim
Managing Director, South East Asia
Protiviti Pte Ltd
MR LEE Kuan Yew was a truly visionary leader and while many will argue about his methods, none can argue about his results. His foresight to build a government based on strong ethical values is perhaps one of his biggest contributions to Singapore. This country's reputation as an accountable, corruption-free government continues to attract investments from global companies which choose to operate here with full confidence.
The focus on good governance is one of the elements that have helped to build trust and integrity and raise Singapore's standing in the international arena. Protiviti's work with companies has likewise shown that those with good corporate governance policies are more likely to be successful. Singapore should continue to strive to stay true to the legacy of good governance left by Mr Lee that has contributed to our remarkable economic success thus far, and keep it going into the future.

MR LEE Kuan Yew spent a lifetime building a solid foundation that will enable Singaporeans to now take the nation to the next lap. The current physical infrastructure is rated one of the best in the world. As a young nation, especially with multi-ethnic cultures, the profound challenge ahead would be about binding the various facets of the national psyche into one.
The best way to honour the spirit of our founding Prime Minister would be the ability for all races to cooperate; also, for all businesses venturing overseas to support one another. The jungle is beyond Singapore shores, where every nation is striving to get ahead. We should build upon Mr Lee's great achievements and enable every Singapore citizen to have opportunities to be the best that he or she can aspire to. This can be interpreted as having positive mindsets, applied to actions that will prosper one and all.
Eric Goh
Managing Director
EMC Singapore
THE First World stature of Singapore stands testament to Mr Lee Kuan Yew's legacy. He was a man of firm beliefs - he valued meritocracy above all and taught the people the importance of innovation in the pursuit of excellence. His commitment to soaring beyond all expectations laid the foundation of the world's first smart nation. With a solid economic plan and an incorruptible spirit, he helped Singapore find a place on the map and become the renowned regional hub it is today.
The highly-evolved Information and Communication Technology landscape that we live in would not exist without the stepping stones provided by Mr Lee. These stepping stones today have grown to be pillars of Singapore's ICT industry, and will propel our nation into tomorrow's future. As we cherish the memory of Singapore's founding father, we must ensure that we continue his legacy.

ALL of us here at AYP Associates felt a great sense of loss upon hearing the news of the passing of our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Singapore has lost a brilliant and visionary man who dedicated his entire life to the building of our country.
As we grieve over his passing, there are many ways in which we can best honour his spirit of dedication, passion and tenacity. We can in our own ways show the same level of dedication and passion that he had, such as by taking care of our employees, our clients and our candidates. At the national level, we should seek to do our part to contribute to Singapore's economy and national stability and success that our founding Prime Minister devoted his entire life to.

MR LEE Kuan Yew, the first of our founding fathers, gave his life to building this nation. His contribution to Singapore is perpetual. Even in death, he continues to contribute to our beloved Singapore. Look at the unity he has brought us over the past days. Looking at the many stories of his life - be it as the titanic statesman who awes the world, the meticulous Prime Minister who paid attention to the slightest details or the loving husband - there are many values we can learn from his life.
Let us not be faltered by his passing but instead, let us continue his unwavering spirit, be steadfast and build upon his success, build upon the strong foundation that he has left us with. Let's live his legacy and continue to bring Singapore to greater heights.
Dora Hoan

Best World International
THE vast, remarkable contributions of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, father of our nation, to Singapore's success just cannot be measured. In a nutshell, without him, there would most certainly not be a Singapore. He surmounted tremendous difficulties, overcame many odds and succeeded in shaping a multi-cultured and multi-racial society into one united nation, giving it an unique identity - an identity all of us Singaporeans are proud of and which many foreigners envy. He made a ""small red dot"" stand out and be noticed all over the globe. He is a legend and he himself is a brand - and because of him, Singapore has also become a brand name. His passing is our great loss.
Mr Lee ruled Singapore with an iron fist, with integrity, harmony and perseverance topping his list of values, which he emphasised in many ways and throughout his rule. Even during his 90th birthday celebration in Parliament in 2013, his wish was to see that Singapore continue to have a clean and honest government and that all would do their part to uphold the highest moral standards.
It is this spirit of living in harmony, dealing with integrity, and persevering till we succeed that Singaporeans grew up with. This spirit has been so ingrained in all of us that many local firms have also unconsciously embedded these values into their corporate ethos. My company, Best World, is one of them.
Mr Lee may have left us, but his spirit will forever linger in us, propelling us to strive for success.

TODAY, Singapore is one of the world's most developed and competitive economies, largely because of Mr Lee Kuan Yew's firm belief that the nation's best asset is its people. This belief resulted in significant investments to ensure Singapore continues to prosper in a rapidly changing world.
These investments have paid huge dividends. While preparing the workforce for skills needed for today and tomorrow, they also transformed Singapore into a key business and financial centre, and have vastly improved the lives of Singaporeans.
Future-proofing the success of Singaporeans and the country's position as a key global player are befitting tributes to Singapore's founding Prime Minister, a giant on the world stage, and his extraordinary legacy of success. A key way to achieve this is to continue investing in developing talent and skills, and here, Singapore is already ahead of the game with new initiatives such as the SkillsFuture scheme.

MY MIND went blank when news of the passing of our beloved founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, hit the nation. It is difficult to imagine a Singapore without this great man who led us to what it is today - a country all Singaporeans are proud to call ""home"". Growing up together with my dear Singapore, I too turn 50 this year and my one wish is for SG50 to be a year where we truly look back and appreciate the progress we've all made under Mr Lee's leadership.
Life is finite, but one's spirit can live forever and we as Singaporeans must fully embrace the virtues that drove our pioneers to scale ever greater heights. Be courageous in our convictions to make Singapore better in order to sustain our success into the future, even if it means making hard choices. I have faith that Mr Lee had done his best to ensure that our present leaders are capable and will continue to look after Singapore as he did. The values engraved on our national flag embody perfectly Mr Lee's vision for Singapore - the crescent moon represents a rising young nation and indeed at 50, we are still a young nation bursting with potential, while the five stars depict our spirit of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality which we must uphold. Changes will occur, but the spirit remains. Thank you and good bye, Mr Lee. We love you.
Christophe Duchatellier

Adecco Asia
MR LEE Kuan Yew was a key leader in building one of the strongest and most prosperous countries in the world and with this came his focus on creating jobs and employment for all Singaporeans to benefit from. The Singapore labour market is in great shape - with low unemployment, solid job growth and opportunities for both fresh graduates and mature workers alike.
We can honour Mr Lee's spirit by keeping the job market healthy and relevant to Singaporeans. This can be achieved by equipping our workforce with skills for the jobs of today and tomorrow - and retraining and re-focusing where necessary. In the future, we need to continue focusing on Singapore's economic competitiveness: gaining margins by increasing our productivity in all sectors especially in labour-driven industries. Singapore's growth and success was the top priority for the late Mr Lee, a project which he worked on until the end of his life. This is how we should honour him, by building upon the foundations he laid for work and for labour in general, and for the nation.

IT WAS with deep sorrow that I came across the news of the sad loss of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding father and one of the brightest leaders of modern times.
I always admired Mr Lee as the greatest politician of at least two millennia. He was an outstanding leader who brought your country to enjoy both prosperity and well-being; he has made millions across the planet admire the modern history of Singapore and to hold it up as the ideal role model to aim for.
Mr Lee brought hope to millions around the world. His selfless work for the people, his talent to get to the core of problems and successfully solve them, his ability to make the right decisions, his skill of turning noble intentions into reality, his honesty and selflessness - all of that ranks him together with the greatest leader-reformers of the world who have changed the course of history.
Achal Agarwal

Kimberly-Clark
MR LEE Kuan Yew has left an unmatched legacy in a nation that is the Singapore of today - modern, clean, safe, efficient, and one of the least corrupt countries. His vision and contribution towards transforming Asia's smallest country into a prosperous society and an economic giant will undoubtedly be remembered for years to come. A pro-business environment and good governance are some of the key reasons why companies like Kimberly-Clark have established our regional headquarters here.
He laid the foundation of Singapore's success through his strong belief in creating a meritocratic, multi-racial society built on the values of integrity, respect and tolerance. It is one of the few places that provide great business opportunities and is also a place one can call home.
As Singapore continues on its development path, it will have to take a pragmatic approach to change and embrace new opportunities. However, keeping the legacy of Mr Lee's values close to its heart will continue to keep Singapore in good stead and be a source of inspiration for future generations.

WE STAND here today a grieving, but strong and vibrant nation. Mr Lee set a solid foundation for businesses - not just for the big boys and foreign investments, but also for homegrown businesses to grow and flourish. From a clean government to business-friendly policies, we are given the perfect ecosystem to succeed and more. Mr Lee was so well-known for his wisdom and foresight, world leaders often sought his counsel. And not forgetting his fighting spirit that led Singapore to where we are today.
I strive to guide my organisation with the same vigour and effectiveness as our late founding father did with Singapore. The best way to honour him is to continue to do our best to be the best and accept nothing less.
Albert Phuay

I WAS born in 1957, and have gone through the tumultuous times in the 1960s. Since then, I remembered every promise Mr Lee Kuan Yew made. Looking back, he has honoured every word, doing more than his very best to build Singapore, a country I am very proud to call home. He dedicated his every breathing moment to build a better life for his people. He is a spectacular leader respected by the world, an endearing father to Singaporeans and a passionate fighter for the causes he believed in.
So, to our dear founding father, Mr Lee, your sacrifices will never be forgotten. You have inspired so many and your abiding passion has laid a solid foundation for Singapore. I believe Singapore will continue to surprise the world, and every Singaporean will honour your life's work and continue your legacy to build a strong nation for our future generations. Always in our hearts, with love.

While we mourn the passing of Singapore's founding father, his legacy will continue to live on in our hearts and minds as we stride towards greater excellence for Singapore.
Much like our values at Mundipharma, Mr Lee was always a great supporter of affordable and accessible healthcare right from the very beginning. His call for continued innovation and advancement in healthcare will be our inspiration for years to come, as we work to ensure Singapore's good health for another 50 years.
Chris Gill

Friends Provident International, Singapore
MR LEE Kuan Yew was truly a visionary and the founding father of modern Singapore as it transformed from a Third World to First World nation within 50 short years. He created a country with a highly skilled and articulate workforce, a strong, well-run government providing an attractive gateway to Asia for multinational companies and enabled Singapore businesses to thrive in an open economy.
We call on Singaporeans to honour his vision of Singapore as a global city. In the post-Lee Kuan Yew era, we must continue to adapt and welcome new ideas, and ensure his vision, passion and innovation never fade from memory. With a global mindset, Singapore will continue to stay relevant to international businesses and safeguard its place as a major financial centre. As it has done so successfully in reinventing itself in the past, Singapore's transition over the next 50 years through its ingenuity and resourcefulness will ensure it continues to punch above its weight on the international stage. May his intrepid and enterprising spirit continue to live long in the hearts of Singaporeans after he is gone.

MR LEE Kuan Yew once said: ""You do not buy and sell this government."" It was a strong statement and one said with conviction by a Prime Minister who was strongly opposed to corruption in any form and who ensured that the government and bureaucracy were as well. Because of this, Singapore is today one of the world's safest cities and one of the top places to do business.
I believe that we will best honour his spirit by continuing to champion a clean and corruption-free environment. Though Singapore is a small country without natural resources, it has shown what can be possible by becoming a place where international businesses can do business freely and without uncertainty, and tapping upon the determination and tenacity of its people.
Sam Yap
Group Executive Chairman and Co-Founder
HTwo Education Holdings Pte Ltd
FOR some of us, words cannot explain the significance of Mr Lee Kuan Yew's contributions to Singaporeans and the nation. His contributions came in a ""holistic"" approach over the time of his leadership. His big ticket items, as I see it, were in education, national development and foreign policies, building international relations between Singapore and the rest of the world. Another visionary contribution was in making Singapore a Clean and Green City, which has added to Singapore's attractiveness as a business centre.
Singapore can best honour his spirit by continuing what he has set for us. We should keep being united as one people and strive for the best in whatever we do. We should go for excellence in a true spirit of honesty, integrity and meritocracy. We must not be afraid to embrace change and innovation if it is in the interest of the nation.
His ideals and principles in leadership must be part of history lessons for all students in school. Perhaps a day can be set aside every year for all to remember his legacy and what he had done for the nation. May Mr Lee rest in peace.

MR LEE Kuan Yew had been nothing short of a miracle for our vulnerable island state of Singapore, leading it from Third World to First in one short generation. In life, he taught us many lessons of which one lies closest to my heart - the importance of meritocracy so that nobody is deprived of an opportunity to be developed to the fullest potential, regardless of family background.
Many of my friends and I were beneficiaries of a meritocratic Singapore espoused and delivered by Mr Lee. But I think the biggest lesson from Mr Lee is that in his death, the nation came together as one to mourn, focusing on the similarities that bind us together, rather than the differences that divide us.

FOR the Tsao Foundation, an organisation dedicated to optimising opportunities in longevity, Mr Lee Kuan Yew had always been an illustrious example of successful ageing. He used his longevity with purpose, serving Singapore with passion while engaging with family and friends and prudently taking care of his own health. Singapore's success bears witness to his vision and perseverance.
While becoming an economic dynamo with enviable standards of living and one of the highest average lifespans in the world, Singapore has not lost its Asian heart, and family remains the cornerstone of social life. The country is on track to becoming a home where all ages thrive. We can honour him by taking a page off his book - make Singapore flourish as our home and utilise our hard-won longevity purposefully.

ACI Worldwide
ACI Worldwide is saddened at the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and would like to express its deepest sympathy to all Singaporeans. His vision for Singapore was crystal-clear: ""For Singapore to survive, we have to be extraordinary!"" His lifetime work not only launched Singapore onto the world stage in a short time-span of 50 years but also ensured that the island-state topped many of the global development indices. Ultimately, his drive was to ensure Singapore survived and prospered against all odds and on this, he was willing to take on all comers.
Singapore has become a key financial hub for the region, fast becoming a ""Smart City"" benchmark, leading in the adoption of e-payments and e-commerce in South-east Asia. Mr Lee's vision relied on the adaptability and resolve of Singapore's residents, and we are fast becoming one of the world's leading digital nations. This ability to adapt and embrace innovation is, for ACI at least, the enduring legacy of the founding Prime Minister.

THE legacy Mr Lee Kuan Yew leaves behind is Singapore, a ""First World oasis"". Modern-day Singapore is where it is today due to the foundation Mr Lee laid in terms of policies, infrastructure and administration - the effective execution of which has been rarely achieved by other leaders within one generation. With this blueprint in hand, Singapore is in good stead to drive its constant state of evolution, to steer through competitive market conditions.
As a developed nation, Singapore is now facing very different challenges from its early independence days - an ageing population and urban density, being the main two. Other developed cities are addressing similar challenges by integrating technology extensively and systematically, particularly IT - giving rise to the Smart City movement. Singapore continues to build on Mr Lee's legacy by developing itself as the world's foremost Smart Nation - integrating data analytics and connected devices to deliver comfort and efficiencies to its citizens, residents and visitors - and becoming the model city globally.
Natalia Shuman
Senior Vice-President and General Manager
EMEA and Asia-Pacific Regions, Kelly Services
THE spectacular growth of Singapore can be largely attributed to Mr Lee Kuan Yew's vision, passion and commitment to the country. The immense contributions he made and the values and ethics he instilled have turned this island state with limited resources into one of the most admired and vibrant global economies, with world-class governance, systems and infrastructure.
Having been in Singapore for 36 years, Kelly Services has witnessed the tremendous transformation of the nation and the evolution of its workforce to become one of the most highly efficient, productive and sought-after today. Aligned with the vision of Mr Lee, we are committed to supporting continuous innovation and encouraging diversity to drive the growth of businesses and the nation. We firmly believe that Mr Lee's legacy will live on, and that the foundation built will continue to serve the nation well for decades to come.

TOGETHER with the entire nation of Singapore, I am deeply saddened by the loss of our first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. As a people, we now enjoy the fruit of Singapore's success because of the extraordinary leadership, foresight and hard work put forth by Mr Lee and his team in building up this country and making Singapore a better place for us all. As a born and bred Singaporean, I am completely in debt to Mr Lee and am extremely grateful for his contributions and sacrifices for this nation.
Yet at this juncture, the baton is with us and our future generations to continue building upon the works of their labour; what our pioneering leaders laid down their lives for. Just as any father would want his children to have good values and principles, Mr Lee would definitely wish his people - fellow Singaporeans - to be a diligent, hardworking people of integrity, following in his example and living impactful lives to help make this world a better place. That, I truly believe, would be the best way to honour him and give the greatest gift to our country's founding father, Mr Lee.

IT IS with a heavy heart that I write this, as we mourn the loss of a truly great man. Mr Lee was a true visionary who dedicated his life to building a nation from the ground up. Through his exceptional leadership and statesmanship, Mr Lee has left a profound impact on the world, and as a nation, we owe him a great debt. His passing is a turning point in history and it is poignant that as we pay homage to his remarkable achievements, we also reflect on how we can best honour his spirit going forward.
For the country's leaders, it would be to continue Mr Lee's legacy in terms of ensuring the economic prosperity of Singapore, the spirit of meritocracy, multi-racial harmony, and clean government, among others. Personally, it is my hope that Singaporeans young and old continue to hold this gratitude in their hearts. We ought to remind ourselves not to take Singapore's success for granted and remember that we are indeed blessed as a nation today because of the vision, unfailing devotion and hard work of a great man.

AS A Singaporean growing up in the '60s and '70s, I have been personally touched by Mr Lee's policies such as housing and education. As a business leader in 3M today, I am even more appreciative of Mr Lee's vision of turning Singapore into a safe, secure and business-friendly place replete with skilled talent.
It is on this fertile ground that 3M has grown its Singapore operations to include R&D, manufacturing and supply chain for Asia-Pacific. In keeping with Mr Lee's determination of driving Singapore to be the best, 3M similarly will continue to keep on the forefront of science and innovation to produce breakthrough technologies to improve lives and businesses all over the world.

His dedication and commitment to the nation and its people is unparalleled and truly inspiring. An extraordinary and driven leader, Mr Lee spurred growth and innovation that led Singapore to be a reputable nation of sustainable greatness.
His legacy will be carried on as Singapore prospers further to becoming a leading nation as he played a key role in placing Singapore on the international map. This allows enterprises like us to operate in Singapore, the strategic hub in Asia.
We are entirely motivated by how Mr Lee brought up Singapore to what it is today, where its success story has transcended beyond the little red dot to the rest of the world.

MR LEE Kuan Yew has shaped the economy and labour force with his vision, thus ensuring the success of Singapore by making the best use of their only resource: human capital. He understood that in order to establish a skilled workforce, a foundation had to be set by creating a literate and educated population. Through Mr Lee's foresight, Singapore moved from being a labour-intensive economy to a First World, skill-intensive nation within the span of a few decades.
Singapore has come a long way from a sleepy kampong to the economic powerhouse that we are today. We owe this immense progress to Mr Lee and while we grieve together with the rest of the country, we must also strive to uphold his legacy. As we move to the next milestone of nation-building, we must continue to build on his invaluable contributions. No action is too small, from the constant upgrading of skills to ensure competitiveness, to adopting an entrepreneurial spirit which allows us to give back to Singapore.
Patrick Sim
Senior Vice-President
Orange Business Services Asia Pacific
UNDENIABLY, a cornerstone of Mr Lee Kuan Yew's lifetime work is the culture of excellence that he built up in Singapore. Through his relentless drive for efficiency and innovation, Singapore offered international businesses an attractive location to set up their regional headquarters and a natural destination for investments.
Singapore has already embraced Mr Lee's legacy with continuous efforts in adopting technology and seeking new ways to raise productivity to remain competitive. In recent years, Singapore has introduced various initiatives that encourage businesses to boost operational efficiency through automation. On a greater scale, the Smart Nation goal rallies Singapore to embrace technology to enhance the country's future and the lives of people. The government is working to enable machine-to-machine technology within homes throughout the nation that could pave the way for home-based healthcare and remote patient monitoring. Exploration in the fields of Big Data and Internet of Things will not only be a boon to the economy, but a necessity for Singapore to take the next big leap.
Singapore has benefited immensely from Mr Lee's vision and leadership to innovate and become a technologically advanced city-state. As we enter a post-Lee Kuan Yew era, Singapore must endeavour to uphold his spirit of innovation and excellence, to enable the country to continue to shine on the global stage.
Pang Yee Ean

Surbana International Consultants
MR LEE Kuan Yew, our founding Prime Minister, was the chief conceptualiser of Singapore's urban landscape.
Among numerous achievements in urbanisation, Mr Lee and his comrades initiated the HDB housing programme that gave Surbana the opportunity to design and manage one million homes for Singaporeans over 50 years and build a unique capability for developing affordable housing that is now recognised around the world.
Mr Lee also envisioned a Garden City as the foundation for sustainable urbanisation long before ""sustainability"" and ""green"" became fashionable. This helped Surbana build its green capabilities which it is also exporting to the world.
Without Mr Lee, there would not be a Singapore. Without Mr Lee, Surbana would also not have developed into the regional engineering and urban consultancy powerhouse it is today.

WITH the passing of Mr Lee, we have reached a key milestone in the journey of nation-building. He has ignited the torch of nationhood; it's for us, the sons and daughters of Singapore, to carry the torch forward and keep it burning bright. This is so that our children and grandchildren will continue to have a place in this world where they can grow, aspire and build their own family.
Building a strong economy for Singapore will be critical for securing this future. As a homegrown company, we must contribute in this process. By doing our best, seeking to pursue excellence, innovate and create value, we too can be a part of the success of the future of Singapore.

MR LEE Kuan Yew led Singapore through the most difficult of times like how a father would lead his family. He worried for Singapore like how a father would worry for his children. He protected Singapore like how a father would protect his children from danger or harm. His incomparable leadership, undivided focus and unparalleled determination have made Singapore a better home for us all.
At the Centre for Fathering (CFF), we endeavour to turn the hearts of children towards their fathers through inculcating engaged and active fathering, and will take inspiration from the life and fathering legacy of Mr Lee.
Mr Lee will live on in our hearts and minds, as we saw in these past days that Singaporeans from all walks of life have already turned their hearts towards our founding father. CFF will continue his legacy by ensuring our future generations emulate his fathering spirit.

We learn from him that it is our obligation to always leave a legacy to future generations, so that they will soar to greater heights.
At Halogen Foundation Singapore, an IPC, we focus on transforming our youths, especially those who need the most help and/or are at risk, into more socially and economically responsible individuals, to lead themselves and others, and to make positive changes, through our proven leadership and entrepreneurship programmes.

OUR founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, had many facets to him - he was a father, a husband, a change maker, a visionary, an adviser - but his pivotal role was that of Singapore's dynamic and far-sighted leader. I have always looked up to his tenacity, nous and strength. Mr Lee was an institution of knowledge, experience and pragmatism. Internationally Singapore is synonymous with the name Lee Kuan Yew, which is a significant indicator of his impact on Singapore through his resolve, love and fortitude for his country. Singapore was his heart and soul and the success of this nation is a testament to his genius and unparalleled commitment to Singaporeans.
He was a giant among men of steel. Mr Lee said this shortly after the separation from Malaysia: ""I am not here to play somebody else's game. I have a few million lives to account for; Singapore will survive!"" Mr Lee was a man who was ahead of his time, he was never a leader for short-term solutions and he was in this monumental crusade for success for the long haul. From a turbulent and uncertain era, he created in 50 years an economy that has become a power to be reckoned with. When we look around Singapore, his realised ideas, dreams and goals are profoundly evident. He transformed an improbable ""country"" into a metropolis; hence we know that we not merely made it, we also blew away naysayers.
He was meticulous and tireless in his pursuit to ensure that every aspect of a Singaporean's life was accounted for - education, housing, security, safety, employment, medical care and a high standard of living. This quest is still ongoing today. As we look to a future without him, we will constantly keep in our hearts the most precious gift his life has taught us - the confidence to always achieve.
With that, we can realise dreams and most certainly be assured of an optimistic future. We have plenty to be proud of and much to reflect upon as we surge forward as a united nation during this period. His passing marks the end of an era, and thus the best way for Singaporeans to honour Mr Lee would be to strive for a new epoch of self-starters who would continue to propel Singapore's success. The best means to do this is to be fearless in pursuing our dreams and goals for ourselves, our businesses and for our country. We have to love the country with the fervour as he did and protect what our founding fathers have earnestly fought for and built for us. We are a young nation at 50, but our prosperity and progress is strong beyond our years. Thus let's go on to place Singapore on the world map for the next generation - that is what will continue his legacy for years to come.
R Sinnakaruppan
CEO
Singapore Education Academy Asia Pacific Pte Ltd
THE May 2011 general election was a watershed. Singaporeans expressed dissatisfaction with policy shortcomings by a new, less experienced third generation Cabinet. The ruling People's Action Party government may have relied on a brute labour productivity strategy to enhance economic growth partly via an immigration policy at all levels (C-Suite, white and blue collar) as a counter-measure against the decade's global traumas - namely 9/11, Sars, 2008 Global Financial Crisis, etc. But local woes like the displacement of senior local executives and lagging infrastructure infuriated Singaporeans.
Post-election, the government moved swiftly to address all the attendant problems of housing and transport and finetuned the immigration policy, as well as steered focus away from a hard emphasis on GDP growth. Still, even now in 2015, Singaporeans don't seem to ""forgive"" the government despite its sincere best efforts to remedy any immigration policy miscues. It seems like a situation of ""damn if you do and damn if you don't"" for the PAP government. With the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, a viral fervour of national spirit has swept across Singapore, reflecting on and celebrating his foundational policies of a corruption-free, meritocracy-based society that rewards hard work and enterprise. It is time that Singaporeans put the past mis-steps behind and recognise that many of Mr Lee's policies in the past 50 years helped us succeed and will still help us succeed in the next 50 years. Let this spirit linger on, otherwise Singaporeans may inadvertently ""throw the baby out of the bathwater"" in the next election.

","   THIS WEEK'S TOPIC: How is your business gearing up to tap opportunities from the Asean Economic Community (AEC) ?
Hans Hanegraaf
Country Executive, ABN AMRO Bank Singapore and CEO of ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia & Middle East
The Asean Economic Community (AEC) will fundamentally overhaul South-east Asia's investment and financial market landscape, with a more integrated financial services industry in the long term. With greater financial collaboration and freer cross-border investment and capital flows between Asean countries, companies will need to revisit their business strategies in order to fully benefit from the integrated economy.
For ABN AMRO, the AEC presents opportunities for us to better serve our existing clients, and widen our customer base, for both our Energy, Commodity and Transport (ECT) and Private Banking businesses. We intend to leverage our solid footprint in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai, in this regard. To remain relevant for our local and international clients, we build tailored solutions based on our close to 190 years of presence, local know-how and expertise in South-east Asia. This involves deepening our local talent bench strength by enhancing the expertise of our existing team as well as complementing it with new talent. At the same time, we are continuously strengthening our infrastructure to ensure our governance, risk management and compliance practices remain robust across the region.
Geraint Hughes
Singapore Managing Partner
Clifford Chance
Looking at the opportunities globally, the option to invest in a region with a population of 640 million and a growing middle class means that, across a range of sectors, our clients globally are increasingly focused on Asean.
From a legal perspective, and even looking beyond the Asean Economic Community, there are a range of initiatives that will help to facilitate investment both within and across the region, not least by providing greater legal certainty and clarity for investors in the years ahead. These initiatives include the potential harmonisation of certain commercial codes, as well as establishing and cementing the reputation and standing of world class forums for effective dispute resolution in Singapore - including through the new Singapore International Commercial Court.
At Clifford Chance, our 200-strong Asean team across the region combines cutting-edge global expertise with first-hand experience of transactions and disputes in the diverse markets of Asean, providing a pathway for successful investment in the region. This approach is built upon our continued investment in our diverse team, our profession and our communities across Asean.
Guy Harvey-Samuel
Group General Manager and Chief Executive Officer
HSBC
The purpose of the AEC is to tighten and seamlessly connect people, businesses and economies within Asean. Its concept is underpinned by the global economic reality that supply chains and capital flows are increasingly moving multiple times, across borders and between big and small companies and institutions and that, therefore, a connected region is stronger than the sum of its parts. The AEC's goal of greater regional connectivity is congruent with what HSBC has sought to do throughout its 150-year history - to connect businesses and people to opportunities across markets and helping them realise their ambitions. We believe our advantage lies in the extent to which our global network corresponds with markets relevant to international business and people flows. Within the Asean context, we will continue to support our clients in taking advantage of the global trade and capital flows, and to help them capture wealth creation and social mobility in these faster-growing markets.
Andrew Wildblood
Head of Asia Pacific Enterprise
Telstra Global Enterprise Service
For all businesses operating in Singapore and more broadly across Asean, long-term success once the AEC is formed will really depend on how you innovate. That means understanding what the new needs of the market are and being able to keep reinventing yourself.
Another key consideration will be the ability to collaborate and recognising that you can't do everything yourself. The nature and speed of markets are changing, the volume of information flows increasing dramatically, and that means partnerships are critical. Our joint venture with Telkom Indonesia to provide managed services to Indonesian companies is a prime example of this, as is our recent acquisition of Pacnet Limited, which will help us become a leading provider of enterprise services to multinational companies and carriers in the region.
As the deadline for the AEC formation approaches and technology makes the world smaller, we are spending a lot of time analysing the economic opportunities, adopting and adapting new technologies, focusing on our pan-Asia growth aspirations. As always, patience is the key to success. However with the anticipated freer flow of goods, services and labour across the ten-nation group, we believe the rewards can be commensurately higher and, many would argue, not to be missed.
Elim Chew

Although it is great that the AEC is ready to get off the ground, it has many inherent issues that are yet to be solved, such as the fact that Asean is not homogeneous, with many cultures, languages, business practices and laws.
It will take some time - of work and legislation, treaties and so on - before it can be anything like the EU.
However, I will not want to miss the boat. We are in negotiations with potential partners in Malaysia and Indonesia in view of the upcoming greater opportunities when AEC happens.
Joseph Lim
Vice-President, Asia-Pacific
FNT Software
The case of Asean as a collective entity in terms of a borderless domestic market from within and as a supply base to key regions in the world is becoming increasingly compelling. A strong case in point is that Asean - as a collective grouping - recently overtook Japan to become China's second largest import source. From a Singapore perspective, we see the differing competencies of each of the Asean countries as complementary, and coming together, a formidable whole. In this context, FNT Software views the Republic as an important gateway into this common market. With its sophisticated IT infrastructure, Singapore has the potential to become one of the top data centre locations in the world. This is why, as a key global data centre infrastructure and service management provider, we decided to use Singapore as a springboard into Asean. We see Singapore as having the strategic flexibility and capability to manage and support the network infrastructure from a skills-and-cost perspective for companies operating in this common market, especially to tap the growing opportunities in Malaysia and Indonesia.
Laletha Nithiyanandan
Managing Director
Talent Design Potential
If it has taken us some ten years to set up the AEC, it's going to take us even longer to iron out the details on how we can become a single market. The reality of doing business in Singapore means being "" hooked"" into the rest of the region, as much of the growth for us, comes from outside Singapore. AEC has potential with emerging economies within it but I don't see businesses waiting for AEC to help fuel their business growth. There are many questions that need to be addressed on how we can become a single market and there are many lessons to be learnt. In the meantime, international business opportunities are growing and Singapore is a brand that is globally recognised; we should tap on this and extend beyond this region. I think this is the future - to become world class.
Tim Moylan
President, Asia-Pacific Japan & Middle East
Infor
As a global enterprise software solutions provider, our clients are increasingly working across borders to meet their customer needs, from hospitality to manufacturing. This has been the norm in Europe, and now this reality of increased cross-border interaction and one-market functionality is strengthening in the Asean region. As businesses expand rapidly and work across markets, critical business decisions are being made in one country and implemented in another. As such, it is crucial to have adequate infrastructure and communication platforms such as the AEC to support and facilitate the movement of data within organisations, among partners and to customers throughout the region, to drive productivity.
The impact of regional integration is greatest for companies that are moving quickly to digitise and move to the cloud, from MNCs to SMEs. As strengthened regional integration will provide a platform that streamlines the exchange of information, cloud solutions will connect businesses with the resources they need to maintain flexibility and scalability. Against this backdrop, the AEC creates unique opportunities for businesses to modernise, achieve unparalleled productivity and tap into growing cross-border opportunities.
Alvin Yeo SC
Chairman & Senior Partner
WongPartnership LLP
While some tariff barriers within Asean have been removed, regulatory barriers in various industries still remain across the different countries. Significantly among these is foreign shareholding limits for investments. Businesses wishing to expand across the entire Asean bloc are therefore presented with hurdles at the outset. As and when Asean countries harmonise these laws, it would undoubtedly present opportunities to investors, including professional services firms. WongPartnership already has presence and business in six to seven of the Asean countries and will continue to export and expand our legal services across this dynamic region. With our well-trained, multilingual and highly qualified professionals, Singapore firms are well positioned to support our clients' investments and business ventures.
Tolan Steele
Group Country Manager Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and SVP, Global Clients, Visa
Singapore is Visa's Asia-Pacific hub and here we are uniquely placed to benefit from a high quality workforce and opportunities across our Asean markets. We are committed to growing our local talent, whether in our most-established office (Singapore) or newest office (Myanmar). Asean is an important region for Visa with markets that are rapidly adopting electronic payments, fostering growth and delivering efficiency to businesses and governments. Driving innovation continues to be our top priority and we have launched several new solutions across the region. Singapore, for example, is one of the world's leading markets for Visa payWave, where more than one in every four transactions is contactless. We are also committed to deepening our client partnerships, and we are increasingly supporting banks across multiple Asean markets as they look to expand and grow their businesses across the region. We see great opportunities in Asean, now and well into the future.
Abhijit Banerjee
Vice-President and Region Head, Apac
Servion Global Solutions
The creation of Asean Economic Community will further increase tourism and commerce among Asean nations. The region will flourish, bolstered by reduced travel restrictions, easy movement of talent, smoother flow of capital and improved fiscal measures for cross border trade.
Growing mobility, increased traffic, greater spends and heightened brand interactions will put unprecedented pressure on brands. They need to not only deliver excellent customer experience but also the same quality of experience consistently across the region. It requires a combination of technology, human capital and training.
Singapore will lead the way from a learning ground perspective. But even Singapore brands will feel the ""consistency-pinch"" once they step out to other, not so developed, markets.
Servion has been serving the Asean region, out of Singapore, for over 12 years. Our Asean experience places us perfectly to support organisations in delivering excellent customer experience; the holy grail of brand building and marketing in the social era.
Lars Mikael Jensen
CEO
Maersk Line, Asia-Pacific
With strong GDP growth, a booming middle class which is consuming more and a growing shift of production from China to some of the economies in Asean, we are seeing an increased flow of both finished and semi-finished goods being shipped within the region. This trend will likely grow exponentially with the formation of the Asean Economic Community, as one of its visions is to develop a single shipping market to enable free flow of goods and services.
At Maersk, we have a comprehensive container shipping service network to cater to the rising flow of imports and exports. We have been operating in South-east Asia for more than 60 years with a broad footprint of 25 offices, and also established our own agency in Myanmar last year. As developments in the region are very dynamic, we are consistently monitoring the market and are agile in adjusting our service network and size of ships, to ensure we can cater to the needs of customers in the different countries.
Teo Lay Lim,
Senior Managing Director, Asean
Accenture
In a recent Accenture survey on the impact of the AEC, we found that many businesses are ready to capitalise on the opportunities in the region created by the AEC.
To succeed in the post-AEC world, companies will need to have ready responses to the following:Operating in an increasingly digital (and virtual) world, harnessing the power of technology to deploy a regional business or enter new markets.^TRedesigning supply chains to take advantage of the freer flows of goods and services across the region.Augmenting talent management capabilities to win the war for talent and manage increasingly diverse regional workforces, which will accompany increased mobility across countries in Asean.
Craig Charlton
Senior Vice-President
Epicor Software Asia Pte Ltd
IT has a key role to play in creating a borderless economy through cyber-connectivity, which is essential for companies to efficiently manage their extended value chain across the region. Scalable and adaptive IT systems will help companies to better manage their global, regional and local partnerships and collaborations.
With the establishment of the AEC, manufacturing will be moving closer to Asean consumers to improve customer responsiveness and turnaround times, making the supply chain more predictable. However, organisations will only benefit if information across the extended value chain is captured, analysed and shared seamlessly and instantly - something that the social business function on modern ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems enables.
Having a single hub for communication that records all interactions helps different departments and regional teams to collaborate and is scalable as markets grow and change. It will help those tapping into the trading opportunities of the AEC to succeed.
Frans Kok
General Manager
AEB (Asia-Pacific) Pte Ltd
Today, companies operating on a global level face high risks, from natural disasters to the financial implications of cross-border trading. The establishment of the Asean Economic Community (AEC) will help to mitigate some of these risks, while giving companies an opportunity to grow in a highly competitive but equitable economic environment.
AEB, as a provider of IT solutions for global trade and logistics, is gearing up for a higher level of integration in the industry. In the past, logistics was very much about getting goods from point A to B. But with the integration of industries across the region to promote regional sourcing, modern IT freight management systems enable companies to set up and manage multiple supply channels connecting warehouses across the region, enabling greater speed of delivery.
Thanks to enhanced infrastructure and communications connectivity, another opportunity to be tapped into is the harmonisation and streamlining of trade and customs documentation, laws and procedures, which will allow for smoother transactions and trade.
Ang Thiam Guan
Managing Director for Singapore and Brunei
Cisco
""Transforming Asean: Moving Towards Smart Communities"" - the theme for this year's Asean Telecommunications and Information Technology Ministers' Meeting - encapsulates the region's commitment to advance itself using smart technology.
Many Asean countries have introduced initiatives to harness the transformative potential of the Internet of Everything (IoE). By connecting the unconnected, Asean nations can transform the way they connect, collaborate and create value as a borderless economic community.
For emerging economies, technology infrastructure is essential. For developed countries like Singapore, it is the innovative application of technology that will allow the AEC to effectively capitalise on the opportunities enabled by the Internet of Everything (IoE), which has been valued at US$19 trillion globally.
At Cisco, we believe that the Internet and education are the two great equalisers in life. Critical to working with innovation and in an IoE economy in Asean is a highly-skilled workforce.
Cisco has been developing this talent pool through the Cisco Networking Academy programme. We have trained more than 4.8 million ICT professionals in Asean over the past 16 years and aim to develop 400,000 more by 2018. The foundation of skills and knowledge will allow economies to accelerate their development and develop new services, resulting in the unified progress of all within the AEC.
Nicholas Bloy
Managing Partner
Navis Capital Partners
Asean economic integration will be a positive move for the regional private equity market. A common market will help Asean companies address a much larger set of customers, thereby enhancing intra-regional trade. Private equity firms will have more opportunities to use their capital and expertise to build local players into regional champions. This is especially true for firms like Navis, which focuses on enhancing the competitive position and governance of the companies we invest in for the long-term. Simply put, the competitively-advantaged company wins - and in the AEC, such companies can win bigger.
In our experience, complex cross-border deals often present investors with the best return and accordingly, the AEC will mean that we are increasingly focusing on investments that take advantage of the region's growing economic linkages.
Cynthia Stuckey
Managing Director
Forum Asia-Pacific
Managing talent will be at the top of the agenda as South-east Asia moves towards regional integration. The Asean Economic Community is set to unleash tremendous opportunities for businesses, including greater access to talent within the region. Business and HR leaders need to adapt their talent recruitment, retention and development strategies to fully ride the wave of opportunities and address the challenges associated with a changing regional marketplace.
As a leadership development and training partner to multinational companies, our focus is on strengthening our capabilities to support regional and global companies that are set to participate in this new era, providing the necessary strategies and capability building for them to effectively manage a highly mobile and culturally diverse talent pool. Business leaders need to brace themselves and adeptly steer their companies to close leadership skill gaps, embrace cross-cultural differences, improve virtual leadership and understand new norms and new engagement drivers.
Max Loh
Managing Partner, Asean and Singapore
Ernst & Young LLP
EY as a globally integrated organisation operates through 28 geographic regions including Asean, which reflects the increasingly borderless business environments such as the impending Asean Economic Community (AEC).
Operating as an Asean cluster not only enables us to better respond to the changing expectations of both our clients for services and our people for career development and mobility opportunities; it also reflects the spirit of the AEC. Apart from providing bespoke client services relating to market entry, tax planning, business and strategy advice, and regulatory compliance, we also support research and dialogues that help to promote the AEC agenda from both policy and business standpoints. Given Singapore's position as a South-east Asia hub and a centre of excellence on many fronts including professional services, it is important that our local firms do not waste the strategic advantage and instead be bold in their growth ambitions to become regional leaders in their respective fields.
Tan Chong Huat
Managing Partner
RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP
The emergence of the Asean Economic Community will transform this diverse region into an integrated single market and production base with significant implications for lawyers in Singapore.
Staying ahead of the curve is the new mantra. Our international reach and mobility are vital to our survival and success in this new environment. We have invested heavily in technology to improve interconnectivity and mobility, and also established the Asean Plus Group, a network of leading law firms in Asia which share our values and aspirations. We now offer clients access to over 750 lawyers in eight jurisdictions throughout the region, and we have plans for continued regional expansion.
Diversity is our strength. Our lawyers gain a better understanding of different cultures through our secondment programmes within the Asean Plus Group. With greater cooperation and interconnectivity, our regional operation is seamless. Our ability to access a larger market enhances our global competitiveness.
Chaly Mah
Chairman, Deloitte Singapore and
CEO of Deloitte South-east Asia
With the impending launch of the AEC in 2015, South-east Asia is becoming a magnet for global and large domestic businesses. For Deloitte, our presence in the Asean marketplace is unique amongst professional services firms because we operate our South-east Asia practices as one single firm. With our recent expansion into Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar, our network now mirrors the markets that form the AEC bloc.
Deloitte South-east Asia enables our professionals to use their combined size, scale and expertise to offer greater breadth and depth of service to our clients across the region, providing deep local expertise with worldwide capabilities. It also provides better development opportunities for our talent to work seamlessly across the region.
We have also developed a specialist team focusing on the impact of the AEC, which is advising local and international companies on how to make the most of the opportunities and address the challenges that result from this integration.
Chris Hayman
Chairman
Seatrade
The establishment of the Asean Economic Community (AEC) will open up significant opportunities for the region's maritime industry. By removing trade barriers, it will increase the connectivity between countries inside and outside the region. In recent years, we have seen a significant growth in the volumes of intra-Asian cargo movements by sea, and the formation of the AEC will surely provide a further stimulus to this already established trend.
In order to effectively capture the opportunities and benefits the AEC will present at the end of the year, I know the maritime industry has been working ahead of time with both the public and private sectors to navigate any challenges standing in the way of the creation of the AEC.
Global industry forums, such as Sea Asia 2015 which is held in Singapore this week, are ideal platforms for industry players to come together to debate and discuss ways to steer the industry forward. Such cooperative efforts are critical for the maritime industry to maximise the opportunities from the AEC.
Chew Seng Kok
Managing Director
ZICO Holdings Inc
The AEC is an important turning point for the dynamic Asean region. Although the pace is sluggish and observers remain doubtful about its slow progress and its lack of noteworthy achievements to date, the Dec 31, 2015 deadline is merely a milestone of ongoing regional integration efforts. More important is the positive direction and momentum achieved towards integration.
To tap market opportunities, ZICO, as an integrated provider of multidisciplinary professional services with presence in the Asean region, has increased its local presence and adopted a liberal regional focus. ZICO is expanding regionally with clients, investing in enhancing skill sets and experience required on advising cross-border transactions. Further, ZICO is adopting new practices and technology to expand its knowledge beyond local boundaries. With the fast pace of change in the business world today, those with an entrepreneurial and winning mindset will take the lead in the new regional economic integration.
Todd Arthur
Managing Director
HRS Corporate
The region is entering an exciting period, with the formation of Asean Economic Community (AEC) as a single, globally competitive market by 2015. The AEC promise is for a region with free movement of goods, services, investment, skilled labour and a freer flow of capital, which has immense benefits for travel and tourism. Asean has been the perfect destination for blending business and leisure travel for centuries. Newly developed hotels, resorts, meeting and events facilities, airports, roads, and tourist attractions, are offering seamless and successful infrastructure and services in exotic cities at a value that no place else could compare.
As the global leading hotel solutions provider, HRS is encouraged by the promising prospects in the travel sector brought by AEC. We will continue to work towards developing sustainable solutions to enhance business travel accommodation management in the region, and play our role in building Singapore as the ""New York of Asean"".
Rex Dong
Managing Director of Asia Sales & Marketing
Seagate Technology
The potentially higher consumer demand from the creation of a larger borderless market, coupled with the region's appetite for innovative technology, gets us excited about the AEC. The grand plan will undoubtedly create greater opportunities for all businesses, but there are two areas in particular which we hope to see immediate impact: we are looking forward to seeing greater efficiency in moving products between borders, especially when it comes to getting products into the hands of our customers. The freer movement of persons and capital will also help the exchange of skilled professionals across the region, leading to better knowledge sharing and innovation-transfer. Seagate also has been actively engaging with the US-Asean Business Alliance for Competitive SMEs, to help SMEs in the region boost competitiveness and be ready to take on opportunities provided by the AEC.
Jim O'Gara
President
UPS South Asia District
UPS is excited about the prospect of a more integrated Asean, home to many of the region's fastest growing economies. Asean's enhanced physical connectivity offers a transportation company such as UPS new efficiencies and opportunities to connect supply chains, something very relevant as companies increasingly conduct integrated sourcing. We continue to support Asean SMEs through UPS-led, capacity-building workshops that help them get integrated into global supply chains. In 2014, UPS opened a new freight consolidation centre in Thailand and also established operations in Myanmar, effectively enabling all Asean markets to benefit from mutual trade, and we continue to seek similar opportunities. In this area, the implementation of Asean's transportation facilitation and customs agreements will be critical.
Gerard Ee
President, Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants, and
Chairman, Singapore Institute of Accredited Tax Professionals
To harness the opportunities brought forth by the AEC, accountants and tax professionals must recognise that the single market integration will bring benefits that far outweigh the challenges brought about by the increased competition.
To facilitate the mobility of accountancy services professionals across Asean, which had high levels of protectionism in various markets, ISCA led the negotiation of the Asean Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) on Accountancy Services that was signed last November. This will allow greater collaboration among professional accountants across Asean. For Singapore, our accountants will gain valuable Asean-centric knowledge, and enhance their value as trusted business advisers especially among small and medium practices planning for regional business expansion.
Backed by years of international tax experience in supporting both regional and international headquarters, Singapore's tax professionals are similarly in a prime position to seize greater opportunities as businesses seek to tap on their expertise to navigate the ""tax minefield"".
Overall, the AEC will provide extensive opportunities for the accountancy sector and profession, contributing to the development of Singapore as a leading global accountancy hub.
Tham Sai Choy
Chairman
KPMG's Asia Pacific region and
Managing Partner, KPMG in Singapore and Brunei
Our multinational clients around the world are expecting the Asean Economic Community to add significant momentum to the region's economic growth. Many of them are in fact more actively preparing for AEC than most local companies are. They are positive about continuing integration, greater competitiveness and the opening of economies.
As their investments pick up, we are seeing in turn greater interest in intra-Asean investment. We have relocated specialist resources from Singapore to other Asean locations, and repositioned many more to cover wider Asean responsibilities. Our consulting business now runs as an Asean-wide business, offering solutions that help our clients differentiate between the different economic environments as they move gradually towards greater convergence.
Jonathan Rake
Country Chief Executive Officer
Zurich Insurance Company, Singapore
Singapore is one of the driving forces for an Asean internal market. As CEO for our Singapore operations, I see the opportunity for further expansion by supporting the insurance needs of companies expanding within the region. Regional integration is underway.
However, it is critical for companies to stay on top of local regulations for their respective industries. For the insurance sector, there are still significant developments required to drive a greater freedom of services and alignment in regulation across the respective jurisdictions, before we can all benefit from the full potential of the Asean Economic Community (AEC). Zurich is preparing for these opportunities, and one area is in the development of new propositions for Asean customers to address the changing industry landscape.
Building on Zurich's International Programme Capability and experience in structuring insurance programmes for the European Economic Area (EEA), our General Insurance corporate division is developing a new proposition that is focused on customers in the mid-market commercial segment with operations in more than one country in Asean. We aim to provide a single solution that addresses their requirements across multiple lines of business and the local regulatory/tax requirements in the markets that they choose to operate in.
J Michael Bradley
Managing Director, CyberSource Asia-Pacific
Vice-President, Visa Inc
(CyberSource is a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa Inc)
CyberSource provides secure electronic payment services for organisations conducting online and mobile commerce. We are witnessing tremendous growth throughout South-east Asia and attribute the acceleration of digital commerce to several trends. First, the rise of a digitally savvy consumer class in South-east Asia is favourably changing attitudes to online and mobile commerce. Second, the rapid pace of technical and business model innovation is creating new ways to tap into evolving consumer sentiment. Finally, the region's 4 per cent-6 per cent economic growth rates attract investment from global leaders in logistics, commerce services, and social media - all fundamental for building digital business models. As the benefits of a more integrated economic region unfold through the Asean Economic Community, we believe that digital commerce will continue to accelerate. We take a long-term view and continue to invest in terms of in-market resources, capabilities unique to Asean markets, and strengthening relationships with relevant industry and government organisations.
Chandran Nair
Managing Director
National Instruments - South-east Asia
Given today's dynamic business landscape, the formation of the Asean Economic Community (AEC) would be a key driving force for market innovation and business opportunities in the region. At National Instruments, we look forward to further strengthen our collaboration efforts with local SMEs across the region by providing them with greater access to tools and technologies. As the SMEs enhance their technological capabilities and productivity in new product development, it also brings about strong and sustainable business growth for the company in the long term. Ultimately, the success of AEC lies in the ability to integrate regional expertise and leverage the unique strengths of each country; to transform Asean into a highly competitive and prosperous region with strong economic development.
V R Srivatsan
Asean Managing Director
Autodesk
The Asean Economic Community presents a possible future of a seamless regional market and production base. I am very optimistic about the opportunities it will bring to regional businesses as it has the potential to make Asean an economic powerhouse.
The emerging economies in Asean face many of the challenges that Autodesk design technology can help address, including infrastructure buildout and innovative design and manufacturing. When a truly seamless market is established, business decision makers can optimise the deployment of resources towards value-driven activity - such as innovation, job creation and growth. We look to consolidate our existing base; be laser-focused on industry sectors such as automotive, infrastructure and oil and gas; expand into high growth cities like Surabaya, Bandung, Medan, Penang, Cebu and Hanoi; and enter new markets like Cambodia, Brunei, Myanmar and Laos.
Ricardo Pesce
Managing Director
Embraer Asia-Pacific
Over the next 20 years, Asia-Pacific (Asean included) will represent about two-thirds of global air travel growth. In the last decade, we have seen a big growth of air traffic in the region but still very concentrated on primary markets which are over-competitive - airlines are finding it hard to make profits with their large-capacity aircraft. However, there are still many opportunities to be explored. For example, we have identified over 800 markets in Asia-Pacific that could benefit from better frequency levels by using 70-130 seat jets. Given the situation, we are advocating to airlines the benefit of moving from ""red oceans"" to ""blue oceans"" - to seek out opportunities in markets that are currently underserved or not even served. Our value-add as an aircraft manufacturer is to provide airlines the ability to ""right-size"" their capacity as they enter these untapped markets and improve their profitability.
Teo Eng Cheong
Chief Executive Officer
International Enterprise Singapore
The integration of ten diverse economies for AEC is a complex and dynamic process. Some areas have seen good progress, such as the elimination of tariff for the goods sector. As we work towards the freer flow of services and capital, the AEC will eventually increase the overall competitiveness and productivity of Asean and make the region more attractive to global investors. Companies should appreciate the different stages of economic development across the region and be prepared to manage different challenges within each country. But the region's sound fundamentals - a young and large population, abundant natural resources as well as an emerging middle class - will propel it forward as a manufacturing and consumerism hub. Singapore companies thus need to adopt a pan-South-east Asia and long-term perspective, and diversify operations across markets to maximise competitive advantages.
Tom Zack
President SEA
EMC Corporation
The formation of the Asean Economic Community (AEC) by the end of 2015 will see unprecedented changes and growth in Asia with better access to new markets and opening up new opportunities for businesses. Technology will play a pivotal role in formalising a single integrated economy. We will see more businesses harnessing cloud and analytics technologies to improve collaboration and get the most out of their data. EMC acknowledges the importance of a united, open market and are supporting our customers through their move to a more integrated market space. The opening up of the Asean markets will see an impact on the talent gap. Bridging this gap will be one of the biggest challenges in the region as we strive to train and nurture local talent who can work and understand the new technologies and get the most of them. The EMC Academic Alliance Programme is a collaboration with colleges and universities worldwide to help prepare students for successful careers in a transforming IT industry. The programme partners educational institutes around the region - 149 partner universities in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Cambodia - to nurture a new generation equipped with important ICM skills to benefit from opportunities in the future. EMC will continue to work on the ground level with educational institutions to bridge the skills gap for a more efficient workforce across the region.
David Leong
Managing Director
PeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd
During the 1960s, when our first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew envisaged a merger with Malaysia, it was because we needed a hinterland for Singapore to survive. He believed in the unity of the two territories. It would be a people connected by geography, economics and ties of kinship. Today, the narrative for the Asean Economic Community is about the same except for an expanded geography and economics. The larger hinterland will be good for Singapore and in pitching ourselves as the New York of Asean or the capital city of AEC, Singapore can play a galvanising and melting pot role. We bring people together to trade, deal, transact in Singapore using our stable and safe infrastructure. The freer flow of goods and services through Singapore, from Singapore or to Singapore, is all good for Singapore. Freer flow of human capital, talents - brain or brawn - will strengthen our workforce and talent pool. For a labour-deficit country, we can add value by educating, training, skilling, re-skilling and deploying the human capital for our own use and then re-deploy them back to their home countries with new skills and knowledge. At the end, all stakeholders benefit - Singapore, members of AEC, people within AEC. A true win-win for all.

The formation of the Asean Economic Community (AEC) is a major milestone that will bring about developments in the region, including free flow of skilled labour across Asean countries.
Our presence in Asean spans 10 countries, underpinned by our unparalleled cross-border ability to source for talents with specific skills and facilitating the hiring process for national and global customers. Standard operating processes and operating platforms, such as our database, are fully integrated across the countries in the region. Companies will need support and advice around accessing and mobilising talent across integrated markets, like in the European Union (EU). In the lead-up to AEC integration, our best practices in EU countries will allow us to help companies in Asean to make better workforce-related decisions. Having a profound understanding of the workforce trends and needs in this region also allows us to advise businesses on a full range of talent management programmes, including training requirements, wage and incentive offerings to ensure successful hiring and on-boarding of employees.
As a corporate member and board member of the International Confederation of Private Employment Services (CIETT), we are able to provide advice to governments and labour organisations on internal and cross-country regulations to achieve key goals like productivity gains, wage parity and women participation in the labour markets.

International SOS
International SOS has been conducting business in the Asean countries for the last 30 years since its founding. Our initial focus was to help foreign MNCs manage and mitigate travel-related health and security risks for their employees in the region.
As the growth of Asean's economies is increasingly driven by intra-regional and international trade, International SOS' core services today revolve around helping companies realise and fulfil the importance of protecting their business travellers and international assignees from these travel-related risks.
Healthcare is a priority sector that the Asean governments have identified for region-wide integration. The upcoming AEC formation is expected to further accelerate the growth of the region's healthcare industry, driven by closer cross-boundary collaboration between service providers, and a freer flow of goods, investment, capital and skilled labour.
With increased affluence across Asean, Aspire Lifestyles, our premier loyalty, concierge and assistance solutions provider, is well-positioned to meet the needs of high net worth individuals in the region.
To ensure that we retain our competitive edge, the company will continue to invest in people development and building capabilities in these economies, using our global base in Singapore as a springboard to engage with the rest of Asean and the world.

AEC is without doubt a positive development. The eventual full integration into a single market will open up significant opportunities for businesses. However, when compared to the EC, this will take a longer time to materialise. Asean is politically, economically and socially more complex and disparate than Europe.
How free the flow of goods, services, skilled labour and investments across the 10-nation grouping will be will depend largely on the willingness of members to put aside national interests for the larger benefits of the AEC. AEC can learn from the experiences of EC in managing the complexity and disparity, which have in recent times threatened the unity of the EC, as a result of economic woes of Greece and Turkey.
While AEC spells vast economic potential for businesses big and small, from across the region and beyond, companies should not rush into investing in it, but be circumspect and do so at a pace and level commensurate with risks assessment, especially on the political front. To mitigate risks, businesses can gear up by setting up local operations to increase their presence and to leverage on the lower costs of doing businesses in non-mission critical and / or less value-add areas, such as manufacturing or backroom support services. For example, I would expect a company such as Medibank, which is involved in the provision of telehealth consulting, to take full advantage of the AEC to fast-track the setting up of a virtual large regional call centre, and tap the bourgeoning business from the combined market of 640 million people.

ACCA
The establishment of the AEC is an ambitious project that will require thousands of skilled and mobile accounting professionals who can work across borders as companies and accountancy firms move towards regionalisation.
As the leading global body that develops professional accountants, ACCA is excited to play its part and is working closely with national bodies and employers across Asean to grow the talent pipeline and increase the mobility of accountants. We have been collaborating closely with the national accounting bodies and regulators of the 10 Asean countries.
Recent initiatives include an Australian Aid funded project to support the implementation of the Asean Mutual Recognition Agreement to support mobility of accounting professionals, and a World Bank-funded project for the Confederation of Asia Pacific Accountants to grow capacity in continuing professional development.
Some of our recent partnerships in Asean include an IFRS training session for the Ministry of Finance in Laos; and a joint conference with the Laos Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Asean Federation of Accountants that discussed regional integration and global best practices to strengthen the finance and accountancy profession.
We regularly participate in the Asean Federation of Accountants (AFA) council meetings to strategise on how to build capacity and strengthen the finance profession across Asean to meet the demands of the AEC, and to achieve the wider economic ambitions and social development goals of the region.

As the leader of an international business based in Singapore, there is one word which springs to mind: opportunity. To me the Asean Economic Community represents a breaking down of barriers to trade, to the free movement of skilled resources and to the free flow of capital and investment. Add to that the opportunity enabled by rapidly evolving technology to bring the people of Asean closer together and I see real excitement ahead. In a business context, the ability to drive more seamless and personalised engagement with your customers is crucial to business growth. Creating an effective environment for your teams to engage with one another is also fundamental to your success. The creation of the AEC will certainly help us to achieve that across Asean, and help to drive Asean's relevance on a global stage - and here in Singapore, with both government and businesses determined to play a very significant role in that success, the outlook is very promising.
Toby Koh
Group Managing Director
Ademco Security Group Pte Ltd
The security industry in the Asean region does have some challenges in the form of non-tariff barriers. The industry is largely regulated by the respective countries' Ministries of Home Affairs or law enforcement agencies. This proves to impede the ease of direct entry into various Asean markets. Once AEC is realised, I hope to see a gradual relaxation of licensing requirements that would allow us to further invest our technology and resources into the region. Ademco has been exploring the investment and setup of a Central Alarms Monitoring Station across the region, banking on the experience and knowhow we have had over the last 20 years in Singapore and northern Asia. It is a grand vision to liberalise the different business sectors across AEC. It is certainly a step in the right direction. However, I believe in reality, this will take many steps over years to achieve what the architects have envisaged.

For a recruitment and staffing company, a free flow of labour - especially skilled professionals - could be a great opportunity for our clients to fill the growing number of job vacancies and need for talent. With an expanded talent pool, it would be easier to find the right skills with the best experience. We need to facilitate labour mobility within the AEC. However before we do that, it is important that professional qualifications are recognised in the Asean's world of work. There are many diverse qualifications, diplomas and licences awarded in different jurisdictions of public authorities in Asia, including multinational companies. There is a need to analyse further the character of these qualifications, their credibility and value on the labour market, both for individuals and employers.

ACI Worldwide
The AEC represents a huge economic opportunity as gross GDP is forecast to grow from US$2.4 trillion in 2013 to more than US$6.2trillion by 2023. The region already represents 4.4 per cent of the world GDP and is forecast to continue to grow exponentially. However, the important trend is how intra-Asean trade has grown over the past 10 years, bolstered by the reduction in tariffs. Asean intra-trade in goods is a US$600 billion market in 2013. To support intra-Asean trade and in particular the rise of e-commerce (benefiting local consumers and businesses), strong, harmonised and efficient payment and settlement systems are required. Every day, ACI works with banks, corporates and national infrastructures to build these systems and support payment flows. In particular, we are focusing on offering secure, reliable real-time infrastructure across the 10 AEC members from national switches to supporting new digital payment methods that will develop e-commerce.

Trend Micro Singapore
As businesses start to grow and invest in the Asean region, one of their major requirements will be the need to protect themselves against advanced persistent cyber attacks (APTs). Over the past year, the increase in the frequency and intensity of cyber attacks globally has created a surge in awareness amongst businesses operating in the region about the importance of securing one's organisation.-
This creates a positive growth market for Trend Micro here in the region, and we are able to leverage that through an established presence with a solid partner network and a core team of security researchers. With the AEC and the economic and political linkages it creates, we will be able to further channel our expertise across Asean and help businesses - both big and small - protect themselves in this new digital era.
Rick Scurfield

NetApp APAC
Trade liberalisation in the region will lead to more investment to promote innovation, economic growth and development. Thus, the formation of the AEC presents a huge opportunity both to NetApp and, most importantly, to our customers. Many of our customers have a regional presence and are branching out into emerging markets as business conditions become more favourable including better communications connectivity and IT infrastructure. Thus, enterprises will look towards IT to enable and enhance their business, increasing demand for our solutions and services.
Furthermore, as NetApp works closely with business partners, we believe that the AEC will propel them to scale out and, as they do so, there will be more co-innovation and stronger business outcomes. This will present opportunities to consolidate and reinvest in other high growth markets. In summary, AEC enables companies such as NetApp to build the right technology architecture in developing nations which are gearing up to become smarter cities.

Best World International
I am looking forward to the day AEC is formed as my company Best World's Asian strategy, grounded with prudent management and nimble operations, is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by this association.
Best World is a key regional player with subsidiaries in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Philippines, an agent in Myanmar. We also have strong networks in Brunei, Cambodia, and Laos. Therefore, the formation of AEC will pave the way for us to enhance revenue and manage cost and productivity to a much larger extent.
The promise of free flow of goods, services, investment, capital and skilled labour will see our company reaping much benefits in terms of product licencing, import duties, and other taxes. We may also move some of our products to be manufactured in Singapore.

There have been a few exciting developments in the Asean region lately and the formation of the AEC is certainly one of them. The objective of the AEC is to facilitate the free flow of goods, services, skilled labour, etc. across the 10-nation grouping and one of the areas of cooperation includes human resources development and capacity building. This is precisely what PrimeStaff offers and the AEC bodes well for our regional expansion plans. In the meantime, we will continue growing our own talent pool and refining our systems and processes so that we will be in a prime position to seize AEC opportunities when they arise.

AYP Associates Pte Ltd
With the formation of the Asean Economic Community, there are numerous benefits that would be created for the region. By having a single market and production base, it will enable Asean to become a highly competitive economic region. We are already seeing positive response from countries such as Japan, where there has been an increase in Japanese direct investment to Asean, as well as from countries such as China and US. The increase in investments will mean increased demand for manpower as the companies grow. To gear up for the AEC, AYP Group is looking to further expand into the Asean region as the demand for manpower translates to business opportunities for us as an executive recruitment firm. By having physical offices in each of the country, we will be able to better understand our clients' requirements and culture.
Sam Yap
Group Executive Chairman and
Co-Founder of Htwo Education Holdings Pte Ltd
The AEC will transform Asean into a region with free movement of goods, services, investment, skilled labour and free flow of capital. Though it would have great potential for businesses, I think it will take some time before the objective of AEC can be realised. Each member country is at different level of readiness to embrace this ""single larger market"" concept .
Htwo Education Holdings will be following up to see how we can tap the opportunities. I see potential in the more prepared economies with infrastructure for the setting up of our educational services for the Asean community. We already have business presence and experience in some of the Asean countries - like Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam - and would like to expand these businesses and also in other parts of Asean where feasible. However in the field of education, issues like accreditation of qualifications is something that the AEC must address in its overall objective to ensure consistency and maintenance of quality and standards.
To help especially smaller businesses to benefit from the AEC, perhaps there should be contact points in each member country where businesses can go to for information and assistance in taking their business across the Asean region.
Rosalynn Tay

In many aspects, Singapore is a phenomenal success story. With virtually no natural resources and a small population, Singapore has become one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Contributing to its dynamic economic performance, Singapore has also launched numerous initiatives with an emphasis on meritocracy. Quality education has been supplemented by a focus on the development of critical and creative thinking, to allow creative and media agencies to ride on and establish our business in a robust and developing market. It provides a platform for us to lead and be the regional communications hub for many local, regional and global brands. Our portfolio of diverse employees and clients has allowed us to achieve employer of choice, thus giving us the edge to grow our business in the private and public sectors within a year.

IT is only a matter of time before Singapore has its first minority-race prime minister, said Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Friday - but it won't be him because he isn't interested in the job.
He said: ""Let me put it this way. We all have our preferences, and I was always, in sports, playing centre-half rather than centre-forward. I enjoy playing half-back and making the long passes, but I am not the striker. Unless I'm forced to be, and I don't think I'll be forced to it, because I think we've got choices.
""We won't always get it the way we expect it to be, but we think very hard about succession in Singapore.""
Mr Tharman, who is also Finance Minister, was speaking at at the two-day SG50+ conference jointly organised by the Institute of Policy Studies and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, and themed ""Singapore at 50: What lies ahead?"".
His preferences aside, Mr Tharman said he doesn't need to become prime minister because there is a great deal of trust and confidence in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is fortunately very healthy, and also because younger candidates are already waiting in the wings; those already in the fray and those entering it will provide Singapore's future leadership, he said.
""It seems to me inevitable that at some point, a minority prime minister - Indian, Malay, Eurasian, or some mixture - is going to be a feature of the political landscape, because we've got a meritocracy; it's an open system. It's just a matter of time.""
He had been asked, during a dialogue with American journalist and author Fareed Zakaria, which was a part of the conference, whether Singapore could have an Indian prime minister.
As for the set-up of Singapore's political landscape, Mr Tharman rejected the idea that Singapore is a one-party state - one where the People's Action Party (PAP) faces no serious competition.
In response to Dr Zakaria, who asked: ""You have 80 out of 87 (elected) seats (in Parliament), how is that serious competition?"", Mr Tharman replied: ""That's an outcome, that's not a design,"" to appreciative applause from the 640-strong audience.
The minister was making the broader point that one inherent advantage in having a dominant player in politics is that longer-term investments and policies can be planned for and implemented.
A one-party state, however, would be a disadvantage, he said: ""It lacks the competition, it lacks the contest - and we don't have a one-party state. We've got to be subjected to serious competition, as we are.""
Saying he and his fellow Singapore politicians spend a lot of time interacting with people, he added: ""It's not what you see in typical one-party states. It's not even what you see in multiparty states where you have a dominant party that fixes the system.""
Still, he stressed that a political structure in which one player is dominant will work only under two conditions: The leading party must be subject to competition, and it must be held accountable to the people - at every election and during its term of government.

A panel of speakers at the fifth annual DBS Asian Insights Conference on Friday agreed that Singapore must be open to change and strategically plan its future to stay relevant.
Titled ""How can Singapore future-proof its relevance for the next 50 years?"", the event had brought together three speakers who discussed the topic from the economic, social and political points of view, addressing issues such as restructuring the economy, raising productivity, press freedom and the definition of meritocracy. They also took questions from the audience.
Ho Kwon Ping, S R Nathan Fellow for the Study of Singapore, said: ""Singapore's survival is a foregone conclusion. I think the bigger danger for Singapore, economically and globally, is whether it'll lose its relevance; whether it'll become a second-tier city-state, as opposed to first-tier.""
To maintain relevance, Singapore needs to deepen its strengths in areas in which it is already proficient, such as the life sciences and hydrocarbon processing, he said.
""This clearly requires a very targeted approach, which is not central planning by any means, but neither is it letting the market take its course.
""So it's a mix between very careful strategic planning and a clear recognition of global market forces.""
Ngiam Tong Dow, adjunct professor at the National University of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, noted that over the last 50 years, Singapore had moved from being a technical to a knowledge-based economy.
The next step was to bring technology into the economy, and raise the competency of workers, he said.
Beh Swan Gin, chairman of the Economic Development Board of Singapore said: ""What's important is Singapore cannot keep still. We have to be agile.""
He added that the gross domestic product (GDP) could not be sustained with just financial services, and that manufacturing should ideally account for 20 to 25 per cent of the GDP.
Mr Beh said the manufacturing sector would never be as stable as finance, given that it is subject to global competition from countries such as India and China, but there are growth opportunities in the area of technology.
To a member of the audience who raised the question of waning productivity levels, Mr Ngiam said it was the responsibility of the upper management to improve them.
CEOs must become ""chief productivity officers"", he said. ""They must get out of their comfort zones from the corporate office ... and lead from the front.""
Mr Ho said technology is often looked to as the solution to raising productivity, but it has only made a difference in the low-skill sectors, not the higher-skill ones.
From the social context, the panel fielded questions about the role of the press in Singapore's future. On this, Mr Ho said that freedom of the press was important, not just to the economic future of Singapore, but also to the well-being of any country. However, ""unrestrained freedom"", exemplified by the likes of French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, were not for Singapore.
Most Singaporeans understand the necessity for ""out-of-bounds"" or OB markers, which demarcate topics, based on the collective Singaporean heritage, that must be dealt with ""very carefully"".
""The bigger question here is: 'As we evolve as a society, as there is less cohesiveness in greater diversity, where are these OB markers going to be?',"" he said, noting that young people such as blogger Amos Yee and the freedom of expression protesters at Hong Lim Park will continue pushing the boundaries.
""These boundaries are (currently) not well-defined,"" he said, and added that a free press would encourage a collaborative, participatory democracy.
Another topic addressed was that of meritocracy, brought up when an audience member asked about the sustainability of using scholars as civil servants.
Mr Ngiam said scholars should not be confined to the government; talent must be spread throughout the economy.
Mr Beh said the historical emphasis on intellect and analytical skills are not going to be enough from now, and then added: ""In reality, there are multiple paths to success today, and certainly going forward.""
Being able to understand issues and rally and connect with people were also important, he added, calling for a review of today's concept of meritocracy, which he described as ""one-dimensional"".

THE government should of course take the lead and responsibility for tackling inequality in society, but we as citizens - both corporate and individuals - should all play a part. The Netherlands, where I come from, has long subscribed to the philosophy that a certain safety net for every individual, irrespective of background, is crucial. Indeed I can see that the Singapore administration has done a credible job over the last 50 years while it continues to tweak its fiscal model and policies for fair and progressive redistribution across society.
The government should continue to actively engage companies in Singapore, national as well as international, to strengthen the nation's civic and social responsibility culture by giving back through focused Corporate Social Responsibility programmes. Across the globe, we can see a growing wave of social consciousness as countries and companies join hands to make life better for needy people in sustainable programmes. Wouldn't it be great when all companies present social contribution facts side by side with their profit numbers in their annual reports? This would be a worthy challenge for all of us as corporate citizens to rise to.
Ho Meng Kit
CEO
Singapore Business Federation
TO further reduce income inequality and increase social mobility, the economy must grow. Then there will be jobs that generate good income. Hence, Singapore must continue to have the conditions for businesses to flourish. This is basic and fundamental. We forget this at our own peril.
We should continue with our policies to tackle income inequality through means-tested social transfers for subsidised housing, education, health care, transportation and utilities. Government has introduced enlightened policies to help the low-wage and older workers and recently PMET, without reducing the motivation for hard work and individual responsibility. However, we need to be alert to do more and be quick to change when circumstances alter in the future.
The increased social costs will have to be funded mainly by the government as it is best placed to address income inequality through transfers. The government in turn draws its revenue from the more well-off, be they corporates or individuals. This is for the betterment of society overall. Over the longer term, businesses can expect to pay more taxes if social costs rise unchecked. If businesses are growing and profitable, this is fine.
Businesses should also make a conscious effort to give back to society. There is more that businesses can do in sharing profits, philanthropy and community engagement to build an inclusive society; and this is not without benefit to businesses. On its part, the Singapore Business Federation formed a charitable foundation in 2013 as a platform to encourage all businesses to be active in this important cause.

INEQUALITY, per se, is a fact of life. What matters is whether there is inequity, or unfairness, that results in inequality. For there to be equity, there should be equal opportunities for all, but not necessarily in outcomes. People should have equal access to health, education and welfare, to the extent possible, to enable social mobility. The government's initiatives in providing good and affordable health care, excellent public schooling, and the Workfare programme, are steps in the right direction. But more needs to be done and this will have to be paid for from public finances through a more progressive taxation system that allows for more equitable redistribution of wealth.
John Bittleston
Chairman
Terrific Mentors International
SINGAPORE is a successful society partly because it has adopted capitalism as its economic model. Capitalism and economic fairness are always at odds with each other. The concept of personal wealth and possessions inevitably leaves some people worse off than others. The question is how to remove the worst of the inequality, while retaining the driving motivation of personal gain. The options are:Government redistribution of wealth - This is notoriously inefficient and costly. Personal generosity - but people are generous mostly when there is something in it for them.
Inevitably there will be some of each method. Singapore will benefit most if the balance between capitalism and welfare is kept short of a fully-fledged welfare state. Incentives to personal generosity can be increased to maximise this still only partly tapped source of creating a fairer society.
Seah Kian Peng

IN social spending, we have so far tended to look at ''causes'' as a proxy for ''deservedness'' - for example if someone was poor because of ABC, he qualifies for help, but if it is because of DEF, he does not. In the latter category, it would be something like - he is a gambler, an alcoholic, someone who does not want to work.
Going forward, I would suggest that even as we look at causes, we should help anyway. While I believe in free will and the importance of hard work, I also feel that we sometimes end up where we are because of the way we are born, our life circumstances and an element of luck. So, let us not be obsessed with and over-worry too much about deservedness. Let us help people regardless.

IF Singapore wishes to grow and develop with the rest of the world, we have no alternative but to be an open economy. From this perspective, we need to consider not just our domestic situation but also the external one. The global economy is embroiled in challenges of globalisation, political conflicts as well as technical, systemic and resource issues.
We need to be able to continually and effectively engage and leverage on our local capabilities and capacity to tap the best opportunities anywhere in the world and to shift efficiently away from areas that are less productive. This should allow us to ensure that our productivity is relatively above global average growth. With that achieved, we can then adjust our fiscal and social economic policies for a better redistribution of wealth in a sustainable way without compromising equity for competitiveness and meritocracy.
Finally, we need to also persist in upgrading the skills and competencies of our people as well as the capabilities of the nation as a whole and cultivate a strong social compact in order to continue to succeed in the longer term.

INCOME inequality is the basis for the market economy. Those who are more diligent, competent and willing to take more risks than their peers achieve greater success.
Platforms are in place today to allow everyone a chance at success. In Singapore, the two most accessible platforms are education and the Internet. We work with schools to help them provide technology and high speed connectivity. This allows students to connect with people all over the world, opening up a wealth of information.
Technology is an enabler that can help make our lives easier. Government and private sector companies should leverage technology in order to make goods and services more accessible and affordable for everyone regardless of social strata. As we strive to put in place a world-class healthcare system and the most advanced infrastructure, housing and transportation systems, we also have to consciously ensure that we cater for all.
Ronald Lee

ONE obvious method that has been bandied about for the longest time is the implementation of a minimum wage system.
The government initiated a good first step last year by instituting a basic wage of S$1,000 for cleaners. Hopefully, this paves the way for legislation to eventually be enacted.
This minimum wage is, however, a fairly contentious topic and the pros and cons need to be carefully weighed. While setting a minimum wage clearly benefits low-income workers, it increases the cost burden on companies that are already operating under tough business conditions. Ultimately, Singapore must keep the country business-friendly, as it has begun to lose some of its competitive edge to neighbouring countries.
The government should be the one leading this change, but it is a catch-22 situation. If they help companies bear the cost of the increase in basic wages, they would have to get the money from somewhere and the most likely source is increasing taxes.
David Siah

WE have a good education system in which many are given equal opportunities. It is also a system which allows individuals to work hard when young, be rewarded for their academic achievements and hence climb the social ladder when they graduate.
In today's context, the social background has become more of a factor than before in how well students do - the degree of family support varies, either because of distractions with bread and butter issues or a lack of time when both parents, or the single parent, are focused on work.
Among others, the private sector can play a part - enterprises can sponsor more bursaries (not scholarships), internships and training opportunities in an attempt to make a difference.

IN a progressive country like ours, narrowing income inequality requires adequate funding to finance programmes to help increase our social mobility so as to mitigate the impact of uneven development paces among our citizens. Tax income can come from many avenues but one source from whom more can be tapped would be the country's top earners. A little more support from this group will barely, if at all, ''disrupt'' their lifestyles, not to mention their livelihood.
Moreover, it may not be such a bad thing if the increasing excessive consumption we've seen in the last decade is curbed a little. Rapidly expanding income inequality, with the discontent and envy that it breeds, will certainly rupture the social fabric. In this respect, we should continue to take this progressive taxation further and not be overly daunted about the top earners abandoning Singapore: For as long as our civic, working, social and natural environment is tip-top, we will remain their best option.

IT is heartening to know that the government recognises that there is rising income inequality and sees a need to enhance social mobility, as well as curb elitism. Tackling these problems will require a ''many-helping-hands'' approach, involving the whole of government, businesses and society.
Halogen Foundation Singapore, an institution of public character (IPC), has been concerned about social mobility and elitism for some time now, way before the recent public interest and discourse on these social issues. We seek to uplift our youths - specially those who are at risk and/or from needy families - through our proven leadership and entrepreneurship programmes, to give them a better head start in life to build their careers and futures.
We hope to transform our youths from disadvantaged backgrounds - who are street-smart if less academic-smart - into business-smart individuals, by equipping them with strong leadership values and lifelong entrepreneurship skills, for them to become more socially and economically responsible.
Halogen desires to complement the work of government and other key stakeholders to tackle the problem of income inequality and social mobility, but we will need more support from government, businesses and the community for us to deliver on our mission to reach out to more of our youths who need help.

SINGAPOREANS used to talk in the past about their personal aspirations in the form of the 5Cs (Cash, Car, Credit Card, Condominium and Country Club). Using that as a yardstick to gauge income equality, the question is whether today a broader spectrum of Singaporeans has the cash to afford these status symbols. The answer is ''yes'' but the gaps that separate the upper tier, the middle class and the less well-off continue to widen considerably.
Cars have become a luxury and so have private property. Country clubs cater mainly to the upper-middle class and above, and as for credit cards, many Singaporeans are incurring debt beyond their means. (There are, according to official figures, 84,000 borrowers with unsecured debt of more than 12 times their monthly income, owing a total of S$7.5 billion).
This growing inequality can only be mitigated by the combined efforts of all members of society and the readiness of everyone to more equally share wealth created in Singapore.

WHILE progressive (indeed, high) taxation has played its part in managing income inequality in the Scandinavian nations, the two economic and social indicators that are more relevant to Singapore are minimum wage and employment rate. Both go hand in hand.
First, Singapore needs to consider moving to a sharing economy whereby jobs are created through innovative collaborative services such as Uber and AirBnb. In this model, any party can be a service provider and the benefits are distributed more transparently to consumers.
However, policies and regulation are still needed to ensure that such collaborative services are carried out in an orderly and lawful manner. This will raise and sustain the employment rate in a tight labour market and slowing global economy.
Second, the government can consider raising the minimum wage across industries where Singapore is highly reliant on foreign labour. This could also encourage locals to take up these jobs and see faster wage growth.
Annie Yap
Group Managing Director

AS Singapore matures as a country, there is a need to promote a more equitable distribution of income in order to foster a cohesive society. One way to reduce income inequality would be to change our current tax mix from personal and corporate income taxes towards real estate and consumption taxes. Equal access to education would be the most crucial for social mobility.
And initiatives like SkillsFuture - which gives Singaporeans opportunities to develop their fullest potential throughout life, by mastering skills - will enhance social mobility. However, there needs to be a mindset shift towards collective national responsibility - to acknowledge that some of us require more help than others. That would be the crux in financing the social costs.
Reuter Chua

ACCA Singapore
SINGAPORE'S flexible, accessible and market-relevant educational system has been very fruitful in mitigating income inequality and improving social mobility. Education - when offered to all, regardless of background - will ultimately remove income and social boundaries, and elevate the whole of society.
There is opportunity to intensify the use of education as a catalyst and a driver for income and social equality. A rigid and formalistic educational system will fall short as some talented Singaporeans will fall through the cracks. The new SkillsFuture initiative, encouraging a lifelong learning mindset and recognising diversity in skills and talent, is key to transforming the educational system. Access to education can be improved through non-traditional and flexible study methods, with an emphasis on skills that are relevant in the workplace. This will encourage more Singaporeans to embark on lifelong learning and enable more to climb up the income and social ladders.
Sam Yap
Group Executive Chairman and Co-Founder
Htwo Education Holdings Pte Ltd
OVER the last few years, we have seen efforts by the government to narrow income inequality in society. For example, there's Workfare, which provides wage top-ups to low-income workers, and the Silver Support scheme, which gives cash payouts for life to low-income seniors. I believe such schemes are helpful in closing the gap but more importantly, opportunities for lower income workers to upgrade their skills or learn new skills should be enhanced. The sense of achievement and fulfilment among low income earners when given opportunities to expand their job scope is invaluable; it will spur them to be even more productive and boost their sense of self-esteem.
The changes to the education system providing more pathways for individuals to acquire skills and qualifications is yet another move in the right direction. The new system that supports and enables everyone to achieve their potential is indeed a welcome change. Employers must now be open to job applicants who come with, not necessarily paper qualifications but strong skills. In all these new initiatives, you'd see that the government is footing the costs - borne indirectly by taxpayers.
Gerald Foo
President
Walton International Group (S) Pte Ltd
REGARDLESS of the model, income inequality will always exist. When society rewards the best, the go-getters and the smartest achievers will streak ahead, leaving the under-achievers lagging behind. If the gap is left unaddressed, societal implications and dysfunctions will set in due to the pent-up unhappiness of the latter group.
There is a need to ensure that there are always plenty of opportunities and avenues for under-performers, so as to allow them to pick up pace and close the gap. This could come in the form of training, upgrading of skills and even financial assistance.
However, it is important that the financial aid should only be a temporary measure. It should not develop into a crutch mentality for them as we do not want society to deteriorate into a welfare state model that supports the masses and kills the incentives for achievers. Overtaxing achievers will also have a deleterious effect on the pursuit of excellence for any society.
Patrick Liew

TO my knowledge, there is no publicly available information about the outcomes of the many schemes for financially challenged students that can help us evaluate these schemes' impact on social mobility. To have a meaningful analysis, there is a need to research and analyse, for example, how students from lower-income households are performing in school compared to their peers from higher-income families.
Research has shown that students whose parents are divorced have lower emotional and social quotient. These factors can affect how well they do in school. We need to help these students on a more holistic basis, particularly those from the lower income groups, so as to break the poverty cycle and improve their quality of life.
Also, the greater diversity in educational programmes these days may result in graduates with skills that have little or no demand in the job market. We need to provide more effective career guidance to help them improve their financial and non-financial returns on education and social mobility.
As Singapore expands its population, facilitated in part by skilled immigrants, there will be more competition for higher value jobs, and Singaporeans' social mobility will be affected. I trust that all relevant ministries are collaborating and working in alignment to ensure that there is no unnecessary loss of job opportunities and ''limitations'' on social mobility.

WE in Singapore need to first recognise that much has been done to try and reduce income inequality. It is no simple feat today, as ''social and economic inequality increases the power and importance of social hierarchy, status and class'' (The Spirit Level). Singapore is on the right track in having a progressive taxation system to redistribute wealth. For businesses, the tax system is also moving away from perks for large companies towards a more equitable localised corporate taxation. Granted, it's a delicate balance to avoid becoming an unattractive business centre.
Additionally ''economic democracy'' in corporate ownership, representation and other such schemes - including mutual associations and cooperatives - help reduce income inequality and help social equality. The key here is for the government to recognise and provide benefits, breaks and other incentives. This will not only help equalise its funding so that no one party bears most of the costs, but also creates a cultural change which in turn promotes greater stability across all sections of society.
Chris Comer

HAVING just marked Singapore's Golden Jubilee, we must continually improve on income inequality through new financial structures, pioneering methods and bespoke financial tools. We should invest in strategies that enable everyone to contribute while at the same time not deterring any corporates or individuals that have relocated here for business.
As a Singaporean company, we believe that our first responsibility is to reward talent by providing above average compensation and a strong career path. Singapore has grown rapidly across many sectors, particularly as a regional hub in financial services, health, education and technology. These key industries should also feature in the government's plans to continually improve the economic system for all.
Mark Billington FCA

ICAEW
WITH a broad economic base that extends overseas, Singapore is in the unique position of being able to create enough high paying jobs for its citizens. Many companies are even unable to find enough local people to fill professional roles, especially in the finance and accountancy sectors, yet unfortunately many individuals here do not have the requisite higher level skills and experience these jobs demand.
ICAEW believes that this inequality can be alleviated by ensuring that there is unhindered access to a wide range of specialised finance and accountancy qualifications.
As a global accountancy body that works alongside governments in many countries to support the profession and promote sustainable economic development, one of our core missions is expanding access to the accountancy sector. Chartered Accountancy provides a rewarding career that both enables talented individuals to rise to the top of any industry and is comparatively financially rewarding. They can also gain the important financial literacy skills that help them start and run businesses.
We believe that providing individuals who come from disadvantaged backgrounds the ability to gain these qualifications, and reach a par with more fortunate peers, is important. Our programmes such as CFAB and ACA provide that opportunity. We welcome any individuals who have the intellect and aptitudes that show they will do well in the profession. But such qualifications do require on-the-job training in addition to passing theoretical exams, so it is essential that employers and government play their part in offering training opportunities to talented individuals, regardless of background.

TRANSITION and change are never easy. A certain yearning for the past is inevitable as we grow older. Government has to make that change clear but gentle. A National Day Rally speech in Singapore is inevitably a glance in the rear mirror even as we chart the road ahead. Without question the most important takeaway from the Prime Minister's speech this year was the identity that has emerged as Singaporean.
Crafted by Mr Lee Kuan Yew and developed so that it remains relevant to the changing world, Singapore has come to understand itself in the same way that a youngster discovers himself or herself in late teens. The biggest impact for successful businesses from this year's rally speech is the confidence of increasing maturity and the knowledge that a creatively driven future will ensure Singapore's success and prosperity for the years ahead.
Max Loh
Managing Partner, Asean and Singapore

THE rally speech was aspirational, yet a reality check. It was a poignant reminder of how Singapore will always be a ""little red dot"" but must continue to strive to be an extraordinary and relevant one. This resonates both at country and business levels. Our people must have a shared sense of pride and mutual support, as well as resilience and vigilance in today's interconnected world where developments elsewhere can threaten and divide our social and economic compact. At the core is ensuring inclusive growth, demonstrated by the policy announcements on cross-generation bread-and-butter issues from housing to education to raising families.
As the government leads, it takes the engagement of corporates and individuals for policies to be truly effective. For example, corporates can complement the government baby incentives by further fostering conducive pro-family workplaces. With a common desire for inclusive growth across all quarters, we can then have the confidence - without the complacency - that Singapore has a secure and prosperous future.

For all Singaporeans present and future, we should continue to be guided by the principles of integrity, resolve and fortitude. The positive atmosphere brought about by SG50, coupled with a strong affirmation from the electorate towards the incumbent government in the coming general election, will help businesses in Singapore ride the socio-economic storm that confronts us! 1-Net remains quietly confident.

PRIME Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech this year was a holistic look at Singapore's success to date, how the nation turned vulnerability to strength and what's essential for continued success. Principles such as self-reliance, multi-racialism and mutual support have been crucial to the success of the nation. These principles mirror our experience at Prudential Singapore. We have enjoyed a rich history and continued growth over the last 84 years. We owe our success in Singapore to cohesion among our staff, as well as mutual respect and strong collaboration in our relationships with our distribution, partners, regulators and industry associations.
PM Lee also spoke on how Singapore needs to ""stay special"" and to be ""alive to our external environment"". We too believe in the importance of staying relevant to our customers, and to continue to meet their evolving needs is a basic tenet of the Prudential culture.
I believe Singaporeans will welcome the many changes that will be implemented: initiatives such as more opportunities for continued education and raising the re-employment age will keep the nation and companies like ours vibrant and progressive, while benefiting from the experience of the more mature employees.
Ingrid Sidiadinoto

WHAT most resonated with me as the Prime Minister delivered his National Day Rally speech were his thoughts on the importance of a small country like Singapore staying alive to its external environment, and maintaining good relations with its neighbours.
At UPS, we believe global trade is key to growth, and that strong economies bode well for regional stability. Business and governments must work closely together to facilitate free trade agreements, transport connectivity, infrastructure improvements, customs modernisation and policies that open borders and overcome trade barriers. Asean leaders in the public and private sectors can take inspiration from Singapore's example of how standing as one united people allows all to progress together.
Eric Goh

EMC Singapore
THE Prime Minister's National Day Rally speech this year was an inspiring reminder to Singaporeans at home and abroad on how the nation has overcome insurmountable challenges to become a First World metropolis. I am glad to see that Singapore's founding principles of meritocracy, racial equality, adaptability and self-reliance remain strongly endorsed by the government and continue to shape our national policies.
The Prime Minister's take on life-long learning and improvement was a big takeaway for me. A continued emphasis on improving education, skill-sets, and remaining adaptable to global trends will empower the local workforce and future-proof Singapore's success. In the same stride, businesses also need to remain adaptable and stay ahead of industry trends, or risk falling behind the curve. Technology and today's innovations are seeds we are planting for the long term, to bear fruit for us in the future.

CHANGES to the re-employment age and duration of paternity leave mean that employers need to ensure adequate preparations are made and that proper support is given for their workforce to remain productive and engaged.
For example, firms can support their older workers after re-employment by promoting flexible work arrangements, with most of these employees keen to strike a balance between work and family. According to the Randstad Singapore Workpocket 2015/16 launched this month, employers should consider providing flexitime arrangements, compressed work schedules, part-time work and telecommuting in a bid to implement flexibility in the workplace.
At the same time, with new fathers now being able to take two weeks of paternity leave, employers will also need to ensure that adequate resources are allocated to cover any gaps and ensure all employees continue to be productive.
Jane Prior
Chief Executive
Bone Marrow Donor Programme
THE National Day Rally speech promised a cornucopia of ""goodies"" with something for almost everyone. It would be hard to deny that the government has been generous and the benefits from the various announcements will be felt across the community now and well into the future.
While the team here at the Bone Marrow Donor Programme will doubtless benefit on a personal level from the various grants and schemes, the largest impact on our work would be if Singaporeans recognised that we have truly ""come of age"" and it is time to reciprocate the generosity. Through our work, we reach out to individuals and also companies inviting them to ""think beyond just themselves"" and to commit a handful of days which may mean the difference between life and death. Yet, every day we are told that people are too busy, time too limited and in any event, a fellow Singaporean is not my responsibility.
SG50 celebrated achievements. Hopefully this was the rallying call that success is only part of it and in literally every way we need each other to survive. In return for being ""looked after"", it's time more hands were held out in friendship and support.
Paul MacAndrew
Country Manager
Regus Singapore
I APPLAUD the proposed move to raise the re-employment age from 65 to 67.
Older workers have a wealth of experience and skill-sets they can offer and are able to contribute to companies in Singapore, making them an important asset. Of course, there are some gaps that we can work on to make it a smoother transition for them.
There is a huge consensus among those I have met that flexible working is a ""bridge"" to keeping caregivers and post-retirement workers in employment so that they can better juggle the demands of their family and their professional life. It can help older workers delay retirement without giving up too much of their hard-earned freedom.
With that in mind, our network of business centres has been expanded to include Geylang East, Jurong and Toa Payoh libraries so that businesses can employ elderly workers, retain knowledge within their organisation, and be more successful in the long run.

""SINGAPORE has to stay special because if we are just a dull little spot on the map, a smudge, we are going to count for nothing. We have to be a shining red dot,"" said the Prime Minister. These words left a powerful impression on me, and poignantly summed up the purpose of the communication and marketing industry in Singapore. Our role is to tell the world not only Singapore's incredible story as a country, but also the incredible stories of its homegrown brands so that they may command a larger spotlight on the world stage.
In the past year alone, we have seen how the marketing efforts of the public and private sectors transformed the SG50 year into a movement in its own right, an emblem of the shared story of a people. Now it is our job to ensure that the evolving story of how this little red dot keeps on shining is told sharply and innovatively into the future.
Patrick Sim

Orange Business Services Asia Pacific
THE Prime Minister's National Day Rally speech addressed the issues of longer life expectancy and an ageing workforce, with the rise of re-employment age from the current 65 to 67 by 2017. This is good news, as the Singapore economy is experiencing slower growth and mature employees present a ready, skilled manpower resource for organisations. A later retirement age also ensures that healthy and active mature employees can continue to contribute to the economy and broader society.
Orange Business Services has a longstanding culture of fair employment. Since the Retirement and Re-employment Act came into force in 2012, we have aligned our hiring policy in support of retaining mature employees. We recognise that older workers have a lot to offer in terms of leadership skills, work ethics, and strong networks. Over half of our employees in Singapore are aged between 40 and 60 years, and we continue to remain supportive of workforce diversity. Orange welcomes the PM's announcement, and we will move to review our human resource guidelines to reflect our commitment to an inclusive workforce.

WHILE the Prime Minister spoke at length about Singapore's external policies and priorities, the key takeaway for us was the domestic policies on housing and population; in particular, encouraging and helping young couples to start families.
From a financial standpoint, young couples have to make informed choices when it comes to purchasing their first home, taking out a loan, managing their finances, and starting a family. Doubling the paternity leave and increasing the Medisave grant for newborns are good first steps. New families get a leg up financially, and fathers are encouraged to be more hands-on in raising their child.
While doubling the paternity leave is, for now, voluntary for corporations, its impact on the organisation still needs to be reviewed. We will discuss and implement this with our own staff who plan to start their own family soon or in the near future.

I AM pleased to hear about the new Singapore Institute of Technology campus to be built in Punggol which will take in more students. Singapore needs to continue its focus on education and churn out more university graduates. A top-rate education system is key to attracting high-value industries to invest in Singapore. The government should in fact relook at whether the target of 40 per cent of each cohort for university education is too low in this day and age. My organisation is constantly looking for talent and would appreciate a supply boost.
I applaud the government for introducing the Proximity Housing Grant. Having multi-tier families living close together is extremely important for the family unit; there would be tremendous social and economic benefits. Retired grandparents helping in the care of grandkids will ease the parenting responsibilities of working parents. Families with elderly folks in close proximity can also render support with convenience. This is in line with Asian family value systems and should permeate into the community.
Steve Melhuish

THE Prime Minister announced a higher income ceiling for the purchase of BTO flats and new executive condominium units. ECs in general - from those near TOP (Temporary Occupation Permit) stage, but especially those that are going to be launched - will benefit from this revised policy as their pool of potential buyers expands. Conversely, mass-market private condominiums might be affected and see some demand shifting over to ECs, especially in locations where competition is tighter.
With renewed interest in the real estate market, we foresee more buyers checking out new projects and comparing properties. Search volume is a leading indicator of transaction volume by three to six months; we therefore foresee that our search and enquiry volume will grow in the next one month or so, with buying activity picking up one to two quarters later.
Lim Soon Hock

THE Prime Minister's National Day Rally speech was social-centric. It does not have much direct impact on businesses. It also did not address many of the challenges facing businesses, especially SMEs. There was no good news for businesses. The only indirect impact arises from raising the re-employment age to 67 years and the optional additional week of paternity leave.
I was pleased the family was highlighted in PM Lee's speech. I applaud his repeated call for a family-first mindset. Our then National Family Council and Centre for Fathering has, since inception, been championing the notion of shared parenthood. Adding another week of paternal leave is therefore a step in the right direction in pursuit of this ideal. Instead of this additional week, I would have preferred that the last four weeks of maternity leave be shared by mother and father, which I have previously advocated umpteen times. This would create less disruption for businesses, while encouraging them to support a family-first mindset, together with the key stakeholders of government and the community.

IT IS great news that the Singapore Institute of Technology will now be located at a centralised campus in Punggol, creating more access to a wider group of students who will benefit from its curriculum and focus on applied learning. Companies like us are always interested in recruiting talented individuals who are hands-on and highly adaptable from classroom to workplace.
I think it is critical that as a business, we constantly look at how we can contribute to the Team Singapore vision. For example, we will continue to collaborate closely with academic institutions to equip their students with unique skill-sets to prepare them for the workforce. We are excited about the new batch of talent graduating from the Singapore Institute of Technology at its new campus, and helping them gain valuable knowhow on data analytics.

OVERALL, I feel that the Prime Minister has effectively addressed a majority of the fundamental concerns. Results achieved in the past five decades are confirmation that we are on the right path, with much potential to further thrive. I am delighted to note that PM Lee has urged the need to ""be alive"" to our external environment even as Singapore attends to domestic concerns, as an internal focus will risk our country's survival. As a country scarce in both land and manpower, Singapore needs to have unity, strength and stability in order to bolster its economic capabilities to fund its existence and growth. We must have leaders who can properly and ably represent and negotiate in the local and, more importantly, international arenas, securing deals that will benefit our country.
As PM Lee mentioned, good relations with our neighbours today may not last, as instability, tension, even war, are rife in geopolitics. Therefore, among all the other great and vital policies addressed at the 2015 rally, the added focus on the external factors resonated with me most as the lack of it will surely impact not just our businesses, but our people, friends and family.

AS THE chairman of the Centre for Fathering and the Dads for Life movement, I was particularly happy to hear the announcement of an extra week's paternity leave for fathers of newborns. We believe that fathers who are involved at the early stage of a child's life will establish strong bonds with the child and at the same time give support to the moms who are recuperating.
It is also wise of the government to allow the private sector flexibility in adopting this perk so as not to cause undue pressure for companies. Hopefully, the private sector will recognise that an active and engaged father is a good and responsible employee and will want to implement this initiative on their own accord.
Dolly Goh
CEO
Singapore National Co-operative Federation
THE Prime Minister's call for self-reliance and mutual support reaffirms the co-operative cause.
Look at NTUC FairPrice Co-operative which has done well to moderate the prices of essential goods for local households. It is owned by individuals and workers who have come together to help themselves, resulting in the ability to help others through affordable pricing. Silver Horizon Travel Co-operative was formed when a group of professional retirees who loved to travel came together to form a co-op to design itineraries ideal for seniors and organise networking ""makan"" sessions to keep themselves active.
We believe co-operatives, which thrive on the same principles of self-reliance and mutual help, can continue to contribute towards building a cohesive society as we move towards SG100. As a co-operator, we hope to see more government support to develop the co-operative sector, which has contributed both economically and socially to Singapore.
Chris Comer

MANY of the key points of the National Day Rally concerned housing in Singapore. These included raising the income ceiling of buyers to ensure that higher-earning Singaporeans will be eligible for subsidised housing. This shows that the government realises the future challenge for the younger generation seeking to own a home in our island city-state, given the rising purchasing costs coupled with space constraints for sought-after areas within the centre.
We need to embrace the fact that Singapore is increasingly becoming like a capital city for the APAC region, which includes inheriting a trend of urbanisation with people moving here to work. Hence, it's a very possible scenario in the future that with the increased ease of travel, adults may rent a home in Singapore but also maintain a retirement home, where their parents live, possibly in another country altogether. For property developers in particular, this would be a trend to watch, for opportunities around South-east Asia to accommodate the supply.

AS A technology company with a strong focus on R&D engineers, the establishment of the Singapore Institute of Technology in Punggol opens up a new talent pool for us. This would be a new generation of leaders, equipped with knowledge, critical skills and creativity, who can help shape future technology.
At the same time, the extension of the re-employment age from 65 to 67 addresses our labour needs in the near future. More importantly, this allows the younger employees to benefit from the experiences of their older co-workers. These policies will act as a bridge between the young and the old, offering them opportunities to cooperate, learn and grow together, ultimately benefiting Singapore.
Annie Yap
Group Managing Director
AYP Group
THE first impact on business would be the increase in re-employment age to 67 years old. As a talent management and recruitment firm, to us and our clients, this increase in the re-employment age sends a greater positive signal to employers to hire older workers. Together with other initiatives such as SkillsFuture and PMET grants, it encourages employees to invest more in their own learning to remain employable and valued. On the other hand, it also encourages employers to be more open-minded in hiring workers beyond the age of 50.
Another takeaway for our business would be the importance of being sensitive to changes beyond our borders. Volatile changes in the environment will definitely have an adverse impact on businesses and investments in South-east Asia, especially for firms intending to expand beyond Singapore. It is a timely reminder from PM Lee that Singapore firms have to be well-prepared for possible downturns.
Reuter Chua
Head
ACCA Singapore
WITH the re-employment age being raised to 67 by 2017, life-long learning becomes all the more imperative. In order to stay competitive, the spirit of self-reliance and mutual support, as highlighted by the Prime Minister in his speech, is crucial. One of the ways is to broaden access for Singaporeans to gain further knowledge in their field and upskill themselves.
ACCA has been providing access to the accountancy sector for aspiring professionals globally for the past 110 years. Through the flexible and cost-effective delivery of the qualification, individuals of any age have the opportunity to obtain and upgrade the skills and qualifications necessary for a rewarding career. In this way, mature workers can continue to contribute productively and effectively to the nation's economy.
Alongside these changes, efforts of both public and private stakeholders can ensure Singapore remains a force - relevant in not just our immediate region, but the world as well.
Jack Chua

ERA Singapore
For ERA - as Singapore's largest real estate agency comprising more than 6,000 registered salespersons - the housing policy changes announced by the Prime Minister during the National Day Rally are most pertinent to our customers and business. The increase in income ceiling to S$12,000 for those buying HDB flats direct from HDB also applies to those buying resale flats with housing grants. For those buying new executive condominium units, the income ceiling has been raised to S$14,000. Further, the Proximity Housing Grant for citizen families and singles is made available to any eligible applicant to help extended families live together or close by.
In the months ahead, we see the housing market receiving the much-needed boost in terms of transaction volume as homebuyers take advantage of these revised housing policies to buy their first home, upgrade or simply relocate to live closer to their loved ones. Our salespersons and staff are gearing up for many busy months ahead.

THIS rally is essentially more people-centric than business-centric, with policy improvements focused on housing and the family, notably enhanced perks for babies and fathers.
For businesses, the key takeaway is the raising of the re-employment age from the current 65 to 67 by 2017. This will change the fabric and composition of our workforce. As Singapore's workforce is ageing and with policies regulating the inflow of foreigners, the only two local options to improve workforce numbers will be to extend the work-lives of Singaporeans and encouraging women to re-enter the workforce. Singapore cannot position itself as a youthful nation with an abundance of labour like in the 1960s to 1980s. We must raise workforce standards with skills and experience focused on productivity and innovation. In short - do more with less.
For businesses, HR must redesign work processes and compensation structures to retain experienced staff and upgrade their skills through continuous training. Compensation and benefits should be reconfigured from the perspective that these senior workers must be paid fairer wages. In many instances, senior workers are asked to take a pay cut to continue employment. This is a regressive pay model.
Along with the higher re-employment age, structural changes will be needed to make sure that the senior workers can remain employed on fair terms and, most importantly, with flexibility.

I CONCUR with the Prime Minister that as we face challenges in the future, we need to ensure a new and effective leadership team is put in place to lead the country in the decades ahead.
All great countries depend on great leadership and great teamwork. These countries succeed or fail because of the leaders and their teams' ability to harness the country's resources to achieve results.
It is not only important to have the right leaders with the right talents to work effectively as a team, there should also be mentorship and coaching to help these leaders learn and carry out their roles and responsibilities properly and effectively.
Sadly, there are few examples of democratic countries that have been able to implement an optimal leadership succession plan.
Politicians can hang on to power beyond the appropriate time-frame. They can also take a populist position and decide to place less emphasis on (and even compromise) economic growth so as to win votes.
Voters can unwittingly forgo a good leader through a freak election result. They can also decide to put less able leaders in public office so as to get unjustifiable gains from the public treasury.
Without an effective team of leaders in government, there could be undue damage to the economy, and Singapore may take a long time to unwind the damages. It can also affect the business world and hinder the growth of both entrepreneurs and enterprises.

THE enhancement to the Baby Bonus scheme is very significant to young families with children as it will help them defray costs in child-raising. I sincerely hope that such incentives will encourage young families to have more children and support the country's population policy. Hopefully with more babies and young children, the demand for care and education for this group will go up. The government's plan to set up large pre-schools is already an indicator of how we are coping with demand for such services. As a company providing a whole range of educational services for children, we are excited about this development and will study how we can address part of the demand in niche areas to support young parents in meeting the challenges of their family life.
Another highlight in the Rally speech that will impact us as a corporate organisation is the higher re-employment age, rising from 65 to 67, to be implemented by 2017. As a family-friendly firm, we are committed to adhere to this new requirement and encourage support for active ageing and benefit from the wealth of experience and skills of our older workers.
Michael Chia

Singapore Maritime Foundation
THE Prime Minister's point on the importance of education and life-long learning in order for Singapore to stay special resonated deeply with me. Having been in the maritime industry for almost four decades, one observation is that while we are always on the lookout for good people, it takes time to develop the talent.
That is why MaritimeONE (Maritime Outreach NEtwork) was started in 2007. This is a joint platform for the government and the industry to collaborate on publicity and outreach initiatives to build awareness and interest in maritime education and careers.
A continuing pipeline of young blood is essential to maintaining Singapore's edge and it is especially important during these challenging times that we build on, rather than diminish, our capabilities. In fact, earlier this month, we awarded 58 maritime scholarships valued at over S$2.6 million under the industry-sponsored MaritimeONE Scholarships and Tripartite Maritime Scholarships.

BEING a father, I am heartened to hear that the government recognises that the family unit requires both parents to be actively involved.
Singaporeans need to change the mindset that equates being present in the office with productivity. Employers must recognise that with the increased use of mobile devices and increased connectivity throughout the country, we can embrace technology and realise the full benefits of work-life balance, strengthen the family unit and ultimately increase productivity levels. This was one key point the Prime Minister conveyed, noting that one is fundamentally related to the other.
Parents do not become a liability simply because they work from home. Polycom embraces what parenthood offers, understands that parents are able to contribute effectively, and gives them the tools they need to work flexibly from wherever they are and not only when they are physically in the office. The increased paternity leave complements Polycom's existing programme and signals to us that the government has Singaporeans firmly at its core.

THE National Day Rally speech was heartening to hear, as the Prime Minister outlined his vision of keeping Singapore exceptional for the next 50 years. Singapore's greatest natural resource is our people, and I was glad that education was highlighted as a key consideration.
At Cisco, we believe that education and the Internet are the great equalisers in life. Strengthening the teaching of science, maths, technology and engineering subjects lays the foundation for Singaporeans to develop the technical skill-sets and critical thinking necessary to thrive in an innovation-driven global economy. Our Networking Academy programme has trained more than 51,000 students in ICT skills in Singapore, and our Internet of Things Innovation Challenges are aimed at young students to cultivate their interest in technology-driven solutions for real issues.
A connected, competitive, collaborative and digital workforce, one with the skills to be future-ready, will be valuable across every industry in the world. This workforce will serve as the cornerstone for building Singapore into a Smart Nation.
Jessica Ang

CareerBuilder Singapore
IT WAS heartening to see our pioneer soldiers being introduced and recognised for their service to the nation at the National Day Rally 2015. Their generation has helped to shape the country's many facets, and defined what it is to be Singaporean.
As a human capital solutions provider, CareerBuilder Singapore has seen the immense benefits of having an age-diverse workforce. The older generation brings with them a wealth of experience, and this is something that we can draw and learn from. With the higher re-employment age, organisations can consider re-hiring older workers who can provide valuable industry insights, and impart leadership skills to the next generation. This way, organisations can maintain a diverse workplace that promotes idea-sharing and inclusiveness.
Singapore is unique because of our deep-rooted sense of community and desire to achieve. As PM Lee put it, we need to create a culture of self-reliance and mutual support in order to succeed as individuals and as a country.

THIS year's National Day Rally revealed something that we take for granted - the political stability of Singapore. Singapore is among the safest destinations in the world and is considered the most secure jurisdiction in South-east Asia. As we continue to maintain a high level of vigilance under the strong leadership of the government, Singapore successfully attracts foreign businesses to our shores, creating greater diversity in our talent pool.
As a company serving the needs of a globally mobile population, the value of embracing a multinational workforce is inherent in our corporate culture. Our Singapore headquarters staff is made up of Singaporeans and 30 other nationalities who make important contributions to business growth and innovation. Their well-being is aligned to our work-life balance philosophy in terms of empowering employees and from an all-encompassing Duty of Care perspective. We look forward to the favourable impact of our nation's continuing focus on education and skills enhancement programmes that have built our world-class workforce.

EACH year, the government tries its best to address the various hot-button issues that Singapore faces as a nation.
While no revolutionary initiatives were introduced, there were some specific and practical changes to help with housing accessibility and affordability. One item that stood out was the enhancement of housing grants for both the low-income and middle-income segments: doubling of the amounts as well as adjusting the criteria so that more Singaporeans will be eligible. The raising of the HDB income ceiling from S$10,000 to S$12,000, and S$12,000 to S$14,000 for ECs, is a welcome and timely move, given the increase in income levels over the past few years.
I was happy to hear that the details of an Action Plan by the Ministerial Committee on Ageing will be unveiled soon, as we need to devise a long-term solution to the problem of our large ageing population.
The other side of this coin is babies, and it is important that measures have been introduced to help increase our local core, which is imperative for Singapore's continued success, given the need to reduce our reliance on foreigners; in particular, the additional week of paternity leave (to be funded by the government), the extension of the Baby Bonus beyond the fourth child, and the increase in Medisave grants for newborns.
The rally this year focused more on enriching the roots of our society by touching on multi-racialism, education and national identity, in addition to population and housing issues. There was not much on the business or economic front except for confirmation that the re-employment age will be raised from 65 to 67 by 2017. This is a positive move to help ease the manpower crunch that most businesses in Singapore are facing.
Zaheer Merchant
Regional Director (Singapore & Europe)
QI Group of Companies
THE National Day Rally speech covered numerous beneficial policies for Singaporeans. The biggest takeaway was the increase in the re-employment age from 65 years to 67 years.
To be implemented by 2017, this change will undoubtedly bring about practical and other benefits for both employers and employees. The continued retention of experienced retiring workers means that organisations will maximise the returns on its investment in human capital. This would at the same time address labour shortage problems while maximising expertise and increasing productivity. It's an enhancement too of an organisation's branding, especially in a greying population. Workers being offered re-employment opportunities reflects positively on the employer.
Psychologically, being gainfully employed gives meaning to senior employees. This is especially warranted when viewed from the practical perspective that it also allows them independence and a sense of self-sufficiency. There is no reason why older employees, as long as they remain healthy, cannot continue to work. Productivity is the key, and there is no reason why older employees cannot be entirely productive. It remains for employers to now consider the practical issues such as benefits or insurance for these older employees, which shouldn't necessarily be difficult, and to implement them.
Mark Billington
Regional Director for SEA

THE focus by the Prime Minister on improving education and promoting life-long learning resonated strongly with me.
The state's support for different routes to attain knowledge and qualifications will help alleviate the continued skills shortage that the accountancy and financial sector is facing. By opening up access to the profession to those who have come from a disadvantaged background, chosen a different academic route, or are switching careers, we will be able to attract more capable individuals and bring much needed diversity to the profession.
There are currently preparatory programmes which allow individuals to gain the requisite foundation knowledge to start training as a chartered accountant. However we need more companies and government bodies willing to provide training contracts and jobs so that people can gain practical work experience while studying.
The continued attention on applied learning will help shift perceptions in Singapore about different ways people can attain career fulfilment and success. It will also help broaden the ways companies recruit and assess their employees. Last year Singapore Polytechnic launched the Finance and Accounting Acceleration Programme which allows diploma students to gain the ACA qualification within three years of graduation and become globally recognised chartered accountants. There are also many programmes which help senior executives transition to the C-level while other certificates enable non-accounting professionals to gain basic business and financial knowledge that can aid them in their jobs. These are examples of how applied learning assists a larger portion of Singaporeans to capitalise on the opportunities of the global economy.
Gerald Foo
President
Walton International Group (S) Pte Ltd
SG100 - or the long term future of Singapore - is, for me, the biggest takeaway in this year's National Day Rally speech. The crucial issue in Singapore is our low birth rate. This will translate into lesser manpower to power our economy in future. Hence the government announced several incentives to encourage couples to have not just one child but as many as possible.
Very often, couples delay having babies because they do not have a flat of their own. Some of these couples' combined incomes may disqualify them from buying HDB flats. Therefore, it is timely that the government offers the various schemes to enable young couples to have a flat of their own. When they choose to live near their parents or in-laws, there is also the proximity housing grant. Such a grant encourages the couples to stay close to their parents or in-laws so that there is someone to look after the babies when they are at work.
The paternity leave will also encourage the fathers to share the responsibilities of looking after a newborn baby. This - plus the 16 weeks of maternity leave for women - may cause some disruption in the workplace, especially for smaller firms. But I think this is a temporary dislocation and companies must take these measures in their stride. I believe that for the future of Singapore, all companies must play their part.
At Walton, we encourage the married staff to start a family. We believe that companies should work hand-in-hand with the government in order to achieve the long term economic growth of Singapore.

","   Singaporeans are leveraging on their technical and cultural skills to move into senior positions at leading financial institutions, say this year's IBF Distinguished Fellows.
AS Singapore cements its position as one of Asia's premier finance hubs, more local professionals are climbing the industry's ranks to take on senior positions at leading regional and global financial institutions.
Indeed, Singaporeans snagged the lion's share of the top honours at this year's Institute of Banking and Finance awards - including those who received the ""IBF Distinguished Fellow"" title, the highest certification mark under the IBF Standards.
The IBF Standards is a development roadmap for financial sector practitioners to attain the necessary training to excel in their respective job roles.
According to the institute, the Distinguished Fellow title is conferred upon ""industry captains who are the epitome of professional stature, integrity and achievement. The Distinguished Fellows serve as a beacon of excellence for the industry"".
Among other criteria, those who receive the title must have experience in senior executive leadership positions, demonstrated outstanding leadership capabilities and made a significant contribution to the industry.
One of the winners of the award is Khoo Kah Siang, chief executive officer (Singapore) at Great Eastern Life Assurance Company Limited, who believes that the growth of the financial sector in Singapore has presented more opportunities for locals to shine.
""Many MNCs headquartered here, as well as established local companies such as Great Eastern, provide job and learning opportunities for Singaporeans here and subsequently abroad,"" he says. In his almost 10 years with Great Eastern, Mr Khoo has taken on four different roles, gaining invaluable experience and exposure in the process.
Other factors that have helped Singaporeans progress in the industry include the high standard of education here, their good command of the business language, as well as a hardworking and disciplined work ethos, he adds.
Another Distinguished Fellow, Susan Soh, Singapore Country Head at Schroder Investment Management, notes that Singaporeans also benefit from their ability to integrate their local or regional market knowledge with experience gained from their foreign counterparts. This allows them to develop solutions that can cater to the specific needs of the local and regional markets.
""Local professionals have an inherent edge in their understanding of the local and regional markets. On top of this, if they can accumulate experiences working outside Singapore, they could potentially acquire the pre-requisites for assuming local and regional senior positions within foreign financial institutions,"" she says.
Ms Soh's own experience in the financial industry has been an eclectic one, having worked in investment banking at global financial institutions in the areas of finance, securities broking and structured derivatives, before moving to her current role in asset management.
""These experiences have given me a spectrum of exposures and opportunities to learn from many foreign financial experts, while also providing me with perspectives of the broader financial ecosystem. I have been able to transfer skills, knowledge and ideas across jobs in a way beneficial to my work,"" she says.
Not surprisingly, the local banks have been particularly active in grooming Singaporean talent for some time. At United Overseas Bank, this is done through leadership programmes that equip individuals with leadership skills and coach senior leaders on making a strategic impact across the bank.
""Employees who perform well are also given opportunities for professional development through job rotations across functions and our international network. Ultimately, we want to help our employees build meaningful careers with UOB,""says Susan Hwee, UOB's group head of technology and operations, and another Distinguished Fellow recipient.
In particular, she believes that many of Asia's banking practices have caught up on the international front in areas such as corporate governance and technology.
""The Asian banking industry has been rapidly building its capabilities and in some areas successfully leapfrogged stages of development,"" she says.
Beyond having the right technical and cultural skills, DBS Bank's group head of compliance Lam Chee Kin thinks that Asians in the banking sector also benefit from a sense of community. ""This community is typified by institutions like IBF and its fellowships. I see many capable, ambitious talents in this community that make me very positive about the future,"" he says.
Room for improvement
Despite the seemingly happy state of affairs, some feel that more can be done to help Singaporeans assume more senior roles in specific segments of the financial sector, such as insurance.
""The local insurance industry certainly has the talent and expertise. What seems to be lacking is the broad-based exposure to different markets, without which it is difficult for anyone to progress to the highest level and to be able to perform effectively at the leadership level over a sustained duration,"" says Great Eastern's Mr Khoo.
He notes that initiatives such as the Asian Financial Leaders Programme by the Singapore Management University to groom locals for leadership positions in the financial industry are moves in the right direction and will provide much needed exposure across geographies through classroom learning, on-the-job training as well as industry visits.
""The phenomenon of locals being in top positions at global financial institutions will not happen overnight. We need to identify the right talents early and provide the opportunities and exposure for them to grow and excel,"" he says.
Within banking, areas like transaction banking are also seeing a shortfall of local talent to fill senior positions in the region. Unlike foreign exchange, corporate finance and investment banking which are taught at most universities, there is a lack of awareness when it comes to transaction banking, says Melvyn Low, Asean head and Singapore country head for treasury and trade solutions at Citi.
""More needs to be done to educate young talent on transaction banking and its attractive prospects so that they can consider it as a career option upon graduation,"" he says.
That said, the rising demand for transaction banking services in Asia and Singapore has resulted in more local talent being developed for senior level positions in the last decade, he says.
Mr Low is also hopeful that greater labour mobility across Asean will not only enable Singaporean talent to develop deep skills in transaction banking in neighbouring countries but also expand and deepen the talent pool across the region.
Meritocracy wins
Geographic and cultural factors aside, it is ultimately the performance of the individual that will determine whether he or she progresses to senior positions at global institutions, says DBS Bank country head Sim S Lim.
Before joining DBS in 2010, he had been with an American global bank for more than 26 years, where he was assigned to work in cities including Kuala Lumpur, Tokyo, New York, Riyadh, Singapore and Hong Kong.
""It's all about meritocracy in global banks. You build your reputation and equity in your own name with each assignment you take on and the quality of work you do. I don't think it has become any easier or more difficult for a local to move to senior positions,"" he says.
""The main reason why a local or anyone else will move up the ranks is their quality of work, their leadership and ability to influence their peers to get things done effectively and efficiently. You do need to deliver tangible results.""
Singaporeans looking to advance in global financial institutions must be willing to take risks in their career and undertake a variety of assignments across different disciplines and different countries to get the breadth of experience required to manage a huge complex global organisation.
Says Mr Sim: ""Too many times, we are too comfortable and hesitate when presented with the option to work abroad. Perhaps it could be considerations like your children's education, but living abroad and experiencing the culture of a foreign country is also an education in its own right.""

VOTE for a strong and stable government to keep Singapore going in a still uncertain world, the ruling party's candidates at Pasir Ris-Punggol urged at a rally on Thursday night.
The incumbents, led by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean and being challenged for a third time by the Singapore Democratic Alliance, said the People's Action Party (PAP) will not only be the party to keep Singapore prosperous, it will also listen to and work with voters to move forward.
The need for a strong and stable government is clear. Both Mr Teo, who is the PAP's first assistant secretary-general, and newcomer Ng Chee Meng, pointed to the shaky position the global economy is in as proof that there will be always such problems around the corner - and one needs a government like the PAP government to deal with them.
""We've the record to show we have done it,"" said Mr Ng, an ex-Defence Force chief.
""PAP is the real deal,"" added Zainal Sapari, who is also a member of the PAP team defending the six-member Group Representation Constituency. ""We're not magicians who appear only at elections,"" he said referring to the opposition. The PAP is here to stay - and it delivers on its promises, he added.
Mr Teo, who also spoke in Malay and Mandarin, recalled that it was the PAP government who transformed a backward and weak Singapore, divided by different races and faced with a communist threat, into an affluent, strong and united country today.
Mr Ng said Singapore's meritocracy has provided every Singaporean a chance to succeed in life - and the education system that underpins it will continue to improve and offer even more opportunities, Mr Teo added.
Only in Singapore does one see nearly everyone owning a home, he continued. ""Where in the world do you find this? Everyone progresses together. No one is left behind.""
But Mr Teo cautioned that this could change if the political and economic instability around Singapore spills onto its shores. Singapore also remains under threat because the communist menace has given way to the danger of terrorist attacks, he said.
""We're honest and upfront, open and transparent,"" Mr Teo said. ""We tell you what the real deal is - and the challenges. We work with you to set the direction for the future.""
He said the PAP looks ahead and have a long-term vision, but it needs to work together with Singaporeans to achieve it.
""How did we succeed? We tackled the challenges together, we have the government that works with you to fulfil our shared dream to make Singapore a home we're proud of,"" Mr Teo said. ""There is much, much more than we can achieve together. We need strong and stable government to work for a stable and better life for all Singapore.""
Mr Ng, along with team members Janil Puthucheary, Mr Zainal and Teo Ser Luck, said many of the facilities voters at Pasir Ris-Punggol want are already being put in place, or being built. They include new hawker centres, childcare centres, schools, a library, polyclinic and hospital.

THE election results reflect the importance of trust - that it takes a long time to build trust and continued effort to sustain it. Using business as an analogy, the government as trustees and stewards must strive to be responsive, connected and insightful so as to deliver exceptional outcomes for their ""clients"" - in this case, the electorate.
Post-2011, the government has been seen to be more responsive to policy feedback and public sentiment; more connected and engaged with its constituents via an expanded use of outreach channels; and has demonstrated a clear comprehension of how it will lead Singapore towards a compelling shared future.
The strong mandate secured is seen as a big win for the country given the clear endorsement of policies by the electorate. At the same time, there remains a recognition that diversity of views for better outcomes continue to be valued and a consultative and collaborative approach will be necessary for future policy-making.
Dhirendra Shantilal
Board Director and Head, Asia-Pacific

MORE than anything the election results are an endorsement of the status quo. Singaporeans have made it abundantly clear that they have no appetite for significant change in the political landscape.
The more consultative approach taken by policymakers as well as politicians since 2011 has won over the majority of Singaporeans. Since 2011 we've seen concrete action on matters of public concern - immigration, transport, public housing, to name a few. The government has been rewarded and this was seen in the strong rebound of support. So what this result calls for is more of the same - open and responsive governance within a stable framework.
The only danger is that responsiveness can veer into populism with policies crafted to win votes and not necessarily to ensure the long-term success of Singapore. The government needs to tread a fine line between catering to the demands of citizens and balancing this with our long-term economic needs - skills, jobs, training, welfare, scaling back foreign talent while maintaining growth. The government must continue to engage the citizens at all levels.

THE outcome of the general election is a resounding vote of confidence for continued good governance and the stable environment that the Singapore government has created, especially at a time of regional and global political and economic turmoil.
A strong government that provides political stability and policy continuity is paramount in creating an attractive business environment. As we look to the future, this strong support for the government will continue to bolster business confidence in Singapore. We have already seen robust policies which have ensured a skilled workforce and low unemployment, and maintained Singapore's edge as one of the leading countries to do business.
The policies must continue to focus on the labour market and promotion of a Singaporean core to ensure that Singaporeans have abundant opportunities to excel, and for businesses, higher productivity and greater business growth.
We are excited about the opportunities ahead as Singapore embarks on its next 50 years and builds on its sterling legacy.

THE first reason to be grateful for the election result is the stability and solidarity it shows the rest of the world. In uncertain times a confident Singapore needs to be reinforced externally even though we know it internally. World commentators have said how good it is to see Singapore strong and independent. To be a world player Singapore has to signal its next big move.
Territorially restricted, there are opportunities all around us to do the equivalent of what Kennedy did when caught in the doldrums. He sent America to the moon. Singapore will not go to the moon but we need a big project to give us goals for the next 10 years. It will be a government priority to provide that scene-changing, politically educating purpose. The young PAP coterie recognises the need for Singapore now to look outwards. We are no longer a parish but a grown-up state.

AS a business leader, I am pleased to see continued confidence and stability in our government. It is good for commerce and international trade. It is good for business. It creates jobs. The PAP's landslide win shows that Singaporeans are a pragmatic lot. Ultimately, most of us vote with common sense, all things considered.
Since GE 2011, the government has adopted a more consultative and engaging approach in policymaking and this has been appreciated by the new generation of discerning voters. This paradigm shift is healthy for our political landscape and long may it continue.
The opposition parties are promising a re-match in the next GE and this will no doubt keep the PAP on its toes. We have matured as a nation and voters are more politically savvy. Gone are the days of walkovers. While the need for diversity in Parliament is important, it should not distract from our nation's main goal - to continue to stay relevant on the world map. With no natural resources to fall back on, human resources are all we have; we simply cannot afford the dramatic revolving door politics that go on in other nations.
Dileep Nair
Singapore High Commissioner to Ghana
MOST psephologists have listed a litany of factors for the PAP's recent landslide election victory, without pinpointing which are the most important. Uncertainty about the future looms large in the minds of the electorate. Everyone is concerned about jobs, cost of living and security, especially given what is happening in the countries around us. These issues matter more than anything else. The PAP is seen as the party that can best assure that these bread-and-butter issues are squarely addressed.
The similarity is striking with the Conservative Party's stunning win in the UK elections in May, when UK voters, who are also worried about jobs and living costs, expressed far more confidence with the Tories' handling of the economy. The PAP now has to reach out to all Singaporeans, even to those who opposed them, without any triumphalism or hubris, to rally the country together and seek pragmatic solutions to make this a cherished home for all.
As for the opposition parties, they will have to work on their manifestos to convince the electorate with cogent arguments that they can be trusted to manage the economy even better than the PAP. Ironically, this may prove to be an easier task when there are less uncertainties on the horizon.

SINGAPOREANS have spoken. Many may moan about the policies and practices of the PAP. But when it comes down to a real choice, the proven and reliable PAP is the obvious and chosen.
This clearly shows that Singaporeans are still conservative and not ready for radical change. We are generally satisfied with the PAP's performance since 2011. The PAP's increased assistance to the elderly and low-income is a popular move in the correct direction. Many middle class and high-income earners I have spoken to do not begrudge more financial benefits to the elderly and poor even when the likely source of funding is higher taxes.
The PAP is now comforted that rational policies that are well thought out and communicated to Singaporeans do resonate with people even though there was a thin layer of vocal disagreement. Engagement with voters on an even closer level seems effective and essential from the election results. Investors and stakeholders in Singapore can now clearly see why the country is a model of political stability in the past and most certainly into the next few terms.

IN giving the ruling party a strong mandate to continue governing Singapore, the electorate is expecting them to continue to be less arrogant, to eventually discard the leaders-know-all posture, listen more, consult more, and to tap the collective wisdom of all, including the Opposition. I think not every idea from the Opposition is inferior, weak or unworthy.
In today's volatile, uncertain, complex environment - which demands teamwork and reliance on others to be successful - a humble political party might perform better than one that believes it has the answer to everything. It is clear to the electorate that the ruling party has learnt lessons from under-planning (which is no different from bad planning) prior to the 2011 elections, which led to the many problems relating to transport, housing, health care and foreign workers.
In the new political landscape, the civil service, government agencies and ministries will have to work harder to be seen to be more apolitical in rendering service and support to all Members of Parliament who are constitutionally elected to serve Singaporeans and Singapore.
The electorate can look forward to a political landscape in which parties can agree to disagree, respect one another's perspectives and engage in robust, constructive debate, to collectively take Singapore successfully into SG100. Above all, going forward, any political party aspiring to govern Singapore should know that a more discerning and informed electorate expects clean and honest politics.

PROPERTY prices and the cost of living in Singapore have been escalating rapidly and this is pushing business firms to look at other locations that are more cost effective. It also creates a constant uncertainty for businesses; despite the many benefits Singapore has to offer, it still has to make sense financially to operate here. Business sentiment here needs to improve and this can happen if the cost of running a business here is reduced so as to attract job-creating ventures and retain them in Singapore.
The political landscape here has changed for the next 20 years at least, because of the influx of new citizens over the past decade. Their priorities and aspirations are different from the Singaporeans who were born and bred here. Integrating them into Singapore is something the government needs to actively focus on; perhaps bring back some of the campaigns of the past like the courtesy and road safety campaigns.

SOME neutral voters might have been put off by the aggressiveness of the opposition party supporters and were perhaps offended by their remarks. The voters do not hate the opposition parties, but they fear their supporters. That might have led them to vote for the ruling party so as ""to be safe"".
The ruling party should continue to be humble, consultative and compassionate. But they must also put the interests of the nation first and push through policies, even if they are not too popular, such as the population policy so as to ensure the sustainability of our nation.

THE 2015 General Election results have given the PAP a clear mandate and reflects voter satisfaction with many of the policies implemented post 2011 election. We do not foresee any major change of course to the policies and political landscape in the near future.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong did speak about grooming the next generation of leaders in the Cabinet and we could see a potential successor clearly identified before the next election. A clear mandate for the PAP will also strengthen both local and overseas consumer and investor confidence in Singapore, despite an uncertain international environment.

THE raft of media coverage, locally and internationally, on the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and on Singapore's golden jubilee celebrations contributed to a very positive view of how well Singapore has done, both economically and socially.
With such affirmative assessments from the developed countries and top international media, Singaporeans may feel quite content and proud of the administration that has got them such kudos.
In my view, the above contributed to the GE results, which assure Singaporeans, investors and the business community of policy continuity and stability. Set against the backdrop of current economic and political volatility in the region, Singapore's steady and sustained growth, pro-business and pro-education-development policies will bode well for Nanyang Business School (NBS) and other tertiary institutions.
Institutions of higher learning like the NBS will flourish in tandem with the nation, to meet the growth in demand for formal business education, and groom business leaders to lead in Singapore and the region.

THE government's resounding win at the election demonstrates the high level of public confidence in the way it has handled the country's main concerns, such as the labour market. The result paves the way for the government to progress the important issues impacting Singapore amid today's global economic uncertainty.
One of these issues is to grow workforce participation rates among women and older workers in a bid to tackle the demographic changes afoot in Singapore. With declining marriage and birth rates, combined with increased life expectancy, by 2020 there will be one person over 65 for every four people of working age.
Future policies should encourage employers to further embrace diversity at the workplace, and think differently about how to integrate employees of different generations, genders, nationalities and cultures.
With the strong mandate, the government now has a critical task to ensure a core Singaporean workforce. Randstad is committed to working with the government to help mentor, coach and shape young local talent and prepare them for fulfilling careers.

THE overwhelming win by the PAP is a vote of confidence in the party's policies and track record. With a majority win of 69.9 per cent of the votes, it is notable that they could not have done it so decisively without the votes of the younger generation. The resounding victory comes amid the uncertainties in the region - Malaysia's domestic political turmoil, China's economic slowdown, and then the uneven recovery in the US and Europe. For an export-driven country like Singapore, political stability is of paramount importance.
While the PAP has implemented policies to address important domestic issues such as housing, public transport, immigration, health care, and retirement affordability, the next five-year term will see the ruling party take on further challenges such as an ageing workforce and a move away from traditional manufacturing towards a Smart Nation vision. This they hope to do by putting in place infrastructure, policies and an ecosystem that sees the people, businesses and government all working together in unison.
Singapore has succeeded beyond expectation in its first 50 years, and there seems to be an overriding confidence that it will remain on this path of success.

2015 reflected a coming-of-age for Singapore with events that galvanised us like never before. Together, we grieved the passing of our founding PM Lee Kuan Yew, marked our golden jubilee, and accorded the government a strong mandate to take the country forward.
To preserve this sense of togetherness, we are seeing more listening, consultation and collaboration between government and stakeholders from the onset of policymaking. While we become more sensitive to emotions of the populace, we must also complement intuition with rational, data-driven decision making. McKinsey and others have done extensive studies on how organisations that do so are more productive, and are more likely to see higher returns.
Tableau's expansion in Asia-Pacific is a prominent chapter in our international growth story and Singapore, with her clean, transparent, and fair policies, is the hub and heart of our operations. As more voices go into policymaking in Singapore, we believe that enabling policymakers to see and understand the data that is generated from these voices, will also enable the right policies we need to thrive in a smarter future.

THE PAP's manifesto includes the desire to be a ""Smart Nation, where daily life is enhanced and made seamless by technology"", and this provides an intelligent insight into the future of Singapore's political landscape. The policymakers have been given a clear mandate to keep Singapore as the best place in the region to do business and they see technology as key to determining success for companies here. Singapore will become the world's early adopter and demonstrate a clear bias towards hi-tech solutions and an education system that embraces tech innovation.
I also expect to see policies that will support investment in becoming the ""global capital of ideas, innovation and thought leadership"". That means continuing to attract foreign investment and a global workforce that will inspire, cultivate and complement Singaporeans.
It's my belief that the PAP's support for upskilling and technology will help Singapore's policymakers drive the future of Asian economies and the country's ever growing influence on the global agenda.

THE Singaporean values of meritocracy, embracing diversity and pragmatism are values that we carry deep within us. Hard work and good performance will be rewarded, that is the reality everywhere. This is seen (for the PAP) in our recent general election.
It is important that our political leaders continue to find and create opportunities or platforms to interact and mingle with people on the ground. It is often difficult for leaders to stay grounded, if leadership is practised from an ivory tower and policies are formulated in isolation.
I also believe that integrity is a fundamental virtue that any political leader must possess before we evaluate his or her capabilities. As Warren Buffet is quoted to have said ""... in looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And if you don't have the first, the other two will kill you."" A leader who is authentic and embodies integrity, conviction and passion will naturally draw loyal followers.

INDEED, the large victory margin came as a surprise given the general sentiment on the ground and online chatter leading up to the election. I am hopeful and have strong faith that the results will not lead to complacency on the part of the ruling party.
Moving forward, I suggest that Members of Parliament should undertake the position on a full-time basis and not hold another full-time job concurrently. This would enable them to dedicate more time to work the ground, maintain better visibility and stay connected with more people to explain existing and new government policies and bring awareness to the many benefits that the government is offering, which many people, especially the less educated, are unaware of. This would also help dispel the notion that PAP MPs are proud and arrogant.
Acknowledging that total acceptance of the party by the population is impossible, I believe the suggestion above would be the best opportunity for the PAP to work towards reversing the strong and sometimes misguided anti-government sentiment - or the results could just swing the other way the next time round.

ARGUABLY, the results of GE 2015 may not spell any policymaking changes. The reality is - and as a review of the PAP manifesto and policies in the past three years shows - the government has set in place certain long-term measures. These touch upon broad-ranging aspects from CPF, MRT enhancements, medical and healthcare policies, to population demographics.
If we are expecting any ""hidden surprises"" of policymaking for the populace, we may well find none since there has been transparency in what proposed plans are in store. There will be refinements and tweaks, of course, depending on how certain policies are viewed.
The overall election outcome and the significant vote swing will make for easier policy implementation, but as long as the policies are beneficial overall, this is positive. As for shaping the ""political landscape"", a simple comparison of the GE2011 and GE2015 results shows that voters are swayed by cogent reasoning and good policies. Clear communication of effective policies have a bearing on political outcomes, and as long as this continues, it can only make for both a better government and debate.
Gerald Foo

GE2015 threw up many interesting outcomes. First, democracy is not only seen in action but is very much alive. For a long time, detractors and critics of Singapore had sneered at the lack of ""true democracy"" because of the way elections were conducted. The fact that for the first time all 89 seats were contested and 2.46 million voters had a chance to vote put paid to this criticism once and for all.
Second, the perceived fear among some citizens about contesting or criticising the ruling party for fear of retaliation by the government can also be dismissed, judging from the slew of opposition candidates, many with impressive credentials, and the harsh statements against the government made during the campaign period. In fact, the election also showed an electorate that is maturing, capable of deciding the kind of future it wants for the country.
Finally, the incumbent party's victory has established the PAP as arguably the longest democratically elected political party in the world. A phenomenal feat achieved against a backdrop of a formula of clean, honest and effective government.
Annie Yap

WITH the PAP winning 69.9 per cent of valid votes, this strong mandate and support for the ruling party reflects the kind of policies that Singaporeans look towards. They want the government to address hot-button issues directly and come up with sound policies to provide solutions to problems. Since 2011, the PAP has been working hard to address issues such as cost of living and retirement adequacy. Being able to deliver their promises on these issues was definitely a reason why Singaporean voters renewed their confidence in the PAP.
Responsible and honest politics also matter. This GE outcome also shows that Singaporeans are not looking for opposition just for opposition's sake but consider carefully how sustainable and purposeful proposed plans are. Policymaking in Singapore has to be pragmatic and relevant, especially in this digital age where people are a lot more vocal expressing their views on the Internet.

THE 2015 election results were a resounding win for Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the People's Action Party. While the Opposition had made some waves with charismatic speeches and well attended rallies during campaigning, the electorate was not swayed and stuck with the PAP's track record and its vision for the future. The PAP's message this election has been for more of the same with regards to the policies and structures that have taken us into SG50, with a few subtle changes to ensure that Singapore can continue on a path of continuous and inclusive growth. As DPM Tharman Shanmugaratnam mentioned in a recent speech, the various policy changes geared to an inclusive Singapore had been set in motion long before the last two general elections.
The PAP constantly emphasised during electioneering that it was important not to mortgage the future for current benefits and the electorate was convinced both by the merit of the argument and the manner in which government ministers went about explaining the various policy measures put in place, including those on foreign labour, health care and CPF.
The government will continue to put forward policy measures geared to a more caring Singapore, and committed to long-term but possibly lower growth in the years to come. In an uncertain world, with political and economic challenges, this is not going to be an easy task.
The issues raised by the Opposition did get traction with some of the electorate. It will be important that the PAP, with its increased mandate, addresses these issues in a manner that is both beneficial and seen to be beneficial to all Singaporeans. At the same time, the Opposition needs to coalesce its organisations and messages to produce a sustained effort, one that is active throughout the five years and not only during the election process.

THE message for the ruling party cannot be any clearer than what this GE has given. Surprise it may be, but it is a well-deserved mandate. The decision of voters to give their ballots to the ruling party did not just happen in recent weeks; it was the culmination of all the actions of the government between 2011 and now. The 2011 GE result was a ""yellow card"" for the PAP as there were quite a few issues that irked Singaporeans. Change is not the word for policymaking now; rather, continuity is.
It's absolutely vital now to continue to entrench the work and policies done since 2011 to continue improving the life of Singaporeans. These are the taming of property prices, building of more affordable HDB flats, caring for our pioneers with love and respect, helping Singaporean PMETs to compete fairly in the job market, improving transport reliability and narrowing the rich-poor divide. Yes, I feel the government has effectively addressed most of the fundamental concerns and the mandate confirmed that we are on the right path to further thrive as a nation.
David Leong
Managing Director

AN almost 70 per cent vote share for the PAP is a remarkable feat; it's quite implausible in democratic elections in developed countries. The PAP government is unlikely to change its policymaking style because of this strong mandate. In fact this strong mandate only confirms that what has been done in the last four years - including in education, health care, jobs and Pioneer Generation benefits - are generally well accepted. The PAP government has transformed from a high-handed, top-down governance approach to a consultative, bottom-up style with a heart. This is shown through PM Lee Hsien Loong's words and actions.
This GE outcome is an affirmation of the PAP's scorecard since 2011. With this, the PAP should move in to strengthen the social safety net, build social cohesiveness among the different demographic groups, and build a stronger Singapore for the next 50 years.
Dora Hoan

THE PAP won the 2015 election. In fact, it is also a win for voters.
The 40 per cent group of ""neutral"" voters have cast their vote in favour of the PAP this time, largely because they could feel the PAP's change and sincerity in engaging with the people. They also hope the government can continue to maintain its integrity and non-corrupt governance.
The voters' greater hope is that the PAP will implement good policies that are advantageous to our country, the people and businesses, after receiving such a strong mandate. We look forward to having a good balance between economic and social policies. The ruling party must also continue to strive to do more ""right things"" because Singapore voters have awakened - they now know how to vote to protect the best interests of the people and the country.

THE unemployment rate has remained low and stable for the past five years, with total employment reaching nearly 3.63 million.
The tight labour market will continue to place upward pressure on wages. However, these wage increases can only be sustained through productivity growth, with the upgrading of jobs and skills.
Policymakers should calibrate Singapore's labour market policy towards even higher workforce growth as well as strengthening the local employment rate, especially in the services sector.
For the remaining part of 2015 and 2016, it is important that we continue to support restructuring towards a manpower-lean and high-end economy driven by productivity - especially in the manufacturing sector and domestic-oriented services. Overall productivity growth is not likely to see a significant uplift this year, but the government has rolled out excellent programmes to support this area. SMEs, as well as MNCs, will be able to get advice to increase their productivity and reach the government's target of 2-3 per cent annual growth over a 10-year period to 2019.

WOMEN in key positions should use their influence and expertise to help other women to develop their careers and become potential directors, Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob said on Tuesday at a conference for senior women executives and professionals.
Neither the percentage of board seats that are filled by women nor the average annual growth rate of about 0.5 percentage points for that proportion are enough, Mdm Halimah said at the event organised by the Diversity Action Committee (DAC).
""At this rate, it will take too long for us to reap the benefits of women's participation at the top decision-making levels of companies,"" she said in a prepared speech.
DAC chairman Magnus Bocker shared that the percentage of board seats on Singapore-listed companies that were held by women had improved slightly this year, to 9.1 per cent as at end-June from 8.8 per cent as at end-2014.
Women comprised 12.7 per cent of new appointments during the six-month period. Among companies with market capitalisation of more than S$1 billion, the representation of women among new appointments in the first half of 2015 rose to 24 per cent from 15.6 per cent as at end-2014.
""It is encouraging to see that more large companies are embracing gender diversity in the boardrooms,"" Mr Bocker said. ""DAC hopes that all SGX-listed companies, large and small, will take positive steps to rebalance their board capabilities.""
Mdm Halimah drew from her own experience in politics, noting that there were only three women members of parliament (MPs) when she entered politics in 2000, but there are 21 today. ""It is not by chance that we have more women MPs now,"" she said. ""All candidates are, first and foremost, selected based on meritocracy, not by gender. However, we make special efforts to look out for capable women to bring them into politics. This has helped us to have diverse perspectives on issues ranging from the economy, education, social development to national development and security.""
Increasing board diversity will likewise require effort, Mdm Halimah said.
Beyond developing themselves, women in positions of power should also give their peers a helping hand whenever possible, she said.
For example, women should encourage other women to stay in their jobs, especially working mothers, Mdm Halimah said. A supportive workplace that offers flexible times so that women can stay fully or partially employed will also allow women to continue accumulating skills and experiences, even if that development is at a slower pace.
Women who have taken a break from work will also require support when returning to the workforce. Mdm Halimah cited financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley that offer internships for returnees to explore a new area of expertise or to return to their old portfolios.
Women in senior positions should also help to mentor junior women executives, not just in terms of skills, but also in terms of ambitions, Mdm Halimah said.
Keynote speaker Lee Suet Fern, managing partner of law firm Morgan Lewis Stamford, said that companies and boards that ignore the pool of talented women in Singapore do so at their own cost.
""I have never doubted that Singapore has a significant proportion of credible women capable of serving on corporate boards,"" Ms Lee said. ""Overseas companies are also looking out for talented women in Singapore to provide them an Asian and female perspective to decision-making in the boardroom. To ignore them is to risk overlooking qualified candidates in a talent-scarce market and to miss the chance to enhance the diversity of voices and views that would make for better corporate governance, more dynamic boards and more business-facing companies.""

AMID angst over finding Singapore leaders in banking, there are clear signs that local talent is rising through the ranks and taking over key positions.
Edwin Low was recently promoted to co-head of investment banking and capital markets, Asia Pacific, at Credit Suisse, expanding his portfolio beyond the South-east Asian region. This makes him the first Singaporean to take up that role at the Swiss bank.
More will follow, Mr Low thinks, though noting that finding local leaders takes time. And a big piece of the strategy in building such top brass in the industry is to keep Singapore's position as a financial centre strong.
""The most efficient way to build the breadth and depth of local talent is to encourage big financial institutions to hub themselves out of Singapore,"" said Mr Low.
""In 1997, when CS decided to hub an investment bank corporate finance pool out of Singapore, I was associate number one.""
Today, the investment banking team sitting in Singapore that covers the South-east Asian market is about 60 strong. Demonstrating the importance of Singapore's hub status, Mr Low once reported directly to Eric Varvel, now co-head of Credit Suisse's global investment banking division, who was previously based in Singapore.
And for top bankers, staying the course has helped, with Mr Low and his peers in Asia taking over positions after several years at the bank.
""Asian bankers are taking over Asian leadership positions. I've been at the bank for 20 years. And my peers are in equivalent positions that run global markets. I know a lot of these CEOs, and they've been CEOs for 20 years. They've seen me firstly carry the bags, secondly, do the numbers, and thirdly, present the book, and now leading the team. So that gives the CEO a lot of comfort,"" said Mr Low.
""Be very clear: all global banks, and at Credit Suisse, we run a meritocracy. But we find that when we recruit new talent in Asia, when they see someone who hails from the region running the Asian hub of Credit Suisse, they then feel empowered to come and join us. They feel that they can also aspire and be a leader one day, because someone else has blazed a trail for them.""
Mr Low admits that banks inherently have a hire-and-fire reputation, and that impedes the tactical hiring of staff during a downturn, and can make it difficult to retain clients.
""A lot of international investment banks are run by product groups. The client becomes a faceless dollar-sign,"" Mr Low said.
He thinks that Credit Suisse has moved to a model that demands focus on the client. For example, the bank has made clear its long-term intentions to grow both its investment banking and private banking businesses in Asia. And though the markets are tough, Mr Low is in hiring mode.
""It's very difficult to keep a straight face, and be credible in front of clients, and talk about commitment, when clients are thinking at the other side of the table, 'Will you be there in two years' time'?"" he said.
""The most important principle is, because we think long-term, we can afford to be counter-cyclical. I think banks are notorious for firing when there's a downturn, and hiring when there's an upturn. The issue is, and everyone knows this, in a downturn, there are opportunities. Here's the difference: Can you convince the head office to allow you to invest in a downturn?""
Mr Low also pays attention to the needs of his high-flying female staff to ensure that they can balance their family commitments. And he himself is a father of five.
""Part of the DNA at CS is to ensure that our bankers stay at CS for, frankly, the rest of their banking career. So we have very proactive strategies to allow them to balance work-life commitments. Specifically, we have some high-performing bankers who have young families, and as a matter of policy, we want to ensure that we have family-friendly practices,"" he said.
""If you have to knock off at 5 o'clock to go pick up your son from daycare, do it. That's priority number one. That's a very important part of our culture. And no one asks questions.""

SINGAPORE has taken the No 2 spot for the third straight year in Insead's annual Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI), behind Switzerland.
The study, released on Tuesday, measures a nation's competitiveness based on the quality of talent that it can produce, attract and retain.
As in the previous studies since 2013, GTCI top 10 rankings in 2015 remain dominated by Western countries, with Luxembourg taking the third place, the US at fourth, and Denmark fifth. The annual study is undertaken in partnership with the Adecco Group and the Human Capital Leadership Institute of Singapore (HCLI).
This year's report cast the spotlight on findings linked to the significant correlation between movement of talent and economic prosperity.
Countries ranked in the top 10 demonstrated openness in terms of talent mobility - close to 25 per cent of the respective populations of Switzerland and Luxembourg were born abroad; the proportion in Singapore was 43 per cent. The proportion is also significant in the US, Canada, New Zealand, Austria, and Ireland. There has been little change in the top 20 since the release of the last edition of the GTCI report, with the exception of Czech Republic joining the league at 20th, New Zealand improving its performance significantly from 16th last year to 11th, while Canada and Ireland saw modest declines.
The report noted that it is not surprising that top-ranking countries have positioned themselves as desirable destinations for high-skilled workers given the need for mobility to fill skill gaps and that a high proportion of innovative, entrepreneurial people were born or studied abroad.
Bruno Lanvin, executive director of Global Indices at Insead and co-editor of the report, said that one of the key recommendations is that countries have to be more proficient in managing the emerging new dynamics of ""brain circulation"".
""While the temporary economic mobility of highly skilled people may initially be seen as a loss for their country of origin, countries have to understand that this translates into a net gain when they return home.
""The way in which Taiwan built its world-class electronics industry, through returnees from Silicon Valley, is a model that many look to emulate,"" Dr Lanvin noted.
New technologies may also create new challenges for workers at different levels - low-skilled jobs may be destroyed by automation while medium-skill jobs may be displaced by algorithms, he added.
Paul Evans, The Shell Chair Professor of Human Resources and Organisational Development, Emeritus, at Insead pointed out that their global data analysis shows it takes more than remuneration to attract and retain talent.
""An increasingly important pull factor lies in the professionalism of companies and management practices, exemplified by highly ranked Nordic countries which score particularly high on meritocracy, professional management and attention to employee development,"" he explained.

FEMALE representation on the boards of Singapore-listed companies increased to 9.5 per cent of total directorships in 2015, with blue chips leading the charge, the Diversity Action Committee (DAC) announced on Monday.
The proportion rose 0.7 percentage points from the 8.8 per cent tally in 2014. It was the sixth straight annual increase, according to data from DAC and its predecessor, the Diversity Task Force regarding Women on Boards.
Women comprised 14 per cent of all new director appointments in 2015, up from 11.9 per cent in 2014 and the highest share in the past 15 years, which is the longest period for which data is available.
The percentage of boards that had women on them also improved to 47.6 per cent, from 44.5 per cent a year earlier. Looking beyond its shores, however, Singapore lagged many of its global peers. Women represented 11.8 per cent of directors in Hong Kong as at Dec 31, 2015, and 10.2 per cent of directors in Malaysia in 2015. Norway as at October 2014 had 35.5 per cent of board seats taken by women - leading the way.
Companies in the Straits Times Index (STI) demonstrated some of the sharpest gains. The percentage of board seats occupied by women at these firms rose to 10.2 per cent in 2015 from 7.6 per cent in 2014.
Companies on the Catalist board also improved, with 9.8 per cent of board seats occupied by women in 2015 compared to 8.5 per cent a year earlier.
In terms of industries, media-related businesses had the largest women representation on their boards, with 21 per cent of board seats held by women, more than double the market average of 9.5 per cent. On the other end of the spectrum, auto and auto component companies filled just 3 per cent of their board seats with women.
""For the past two years, we have seen a significant improvement in the number of women directors on boards of SGX-listed companies, especially in large companies,"" DAC chairman Magnus Bocker said in a statement. ""This indicates that companies are responding to investor groups and DAC's call for greater gender diversity on boards, as part of a broader view of board diversity. We believe that companies will appoint more women directors in the coming years as this would give them an edge in managing their risks and opportunities to bring the companies forward.""
Lawyer Rachel Eng of Wong Partnership, who sits on the boards of Starhub and SPH Reit, said it was good to see positive momentum.
""I think DAC has tried to bring that high-level conversation to the boardrooms talking to nominating committee chairs et cetera, getting commitment from human capital firms and recruitment firms to put up women candidates. So we're not just talking about grand plans, but also detailed plans on the ground,"" she said.
Ms Eng said it was important to keep diversity on the agenda with the economy headed for a slowdown.
""Right now everyone's busy with challenging business conditions...This topic may not get top priority if businesses are trying to make ends meet,"" she said.
While practical limitations, such as the renewal cycle of existing directorships, may make it difficult to improve diversity as quickly as desired, companies should not hesitate to find and keep female talent, Ms Eng said. However, she was not supportive of imposing a quota right now.
""The general preference among the women leaders is to not have a fixed quota,"" she said. ""Most women, especially in Singapore where we value meritocracy, want to be appointed based on their merit rather than to fill a number.""

GOOGLE remains the top dream employer among Singapore university business students but it has slipped to second place among their engineering and natural science counterparts in the latest popularity poll by employer branding firm Universum.
A*Star, the local government statutory board which promotes scientific research and talent for knowledge- based Singapore, has overtaken the US Internet company as the most attractive employer for engineering and natural science students here.
A*Star is ranked only 88 among business students' employers of choice. Other Singapore employers who made it to Universum's Singapore Top 100 Ideal Employers rankings for business students include Singapore Airlines (2), Changi Airport Group (8), DBS (12), Monetary Authority of Singapore or MAS (16), MediaCorp (21), Temasek Holdings (25) and Ministry of Finance (33).
Among their foreign-based competitors in the rankings are Walt Disney (3), JP Morgan (5), Apple (9), IKEA (18), Uniqlo (45), Shell (58) and Bosch (100).
Singapore employers ranked by the engineering and natural science students include Ministry of Health (9), Defence Science & Technology Agency (11), Keppel Corporation (18), OCBC Bank (39), CapitaLand (48), Singtel (60), Far East Organisation (77) and Ministry of Trade and Industry (96).
GSK (5), Boeing (15), Unilever (19), Facebook (26), Samsung (35), Siemens (59), Bloomberg (79), Bain & Company (81), KPMG (88), Cisco Systems (95) and HP (99) are among the foreign-based employers on this list.
The rankings are based on a survey of 12,500 students from Singapore Management University, SIM University, Nanyang Technological University and National University of Singapore.
Universum noted that there's a significant gap between MAS and the rest of the public sector employers, ""even though the Ministry of Finance has a similar finance portfolio"". It said MAS has ""distinct strengths"", offering business students who join the central bank challenging work, professional training and development as well as leadership opportunities.
According to Universum, MAS also appeals to job seekers because it recruits only the best talent and upholds high ethical standards.
Eight in 10 of the banks in the business students' rankings saw a drop in their ratings; only DBS and UOB showed improvements. Local banks have done better than the foreign banks and the gap between them has widened. ""The three local banks (DBS, UOB and OCBC) are still hiring to grow and fortify their operations, bucking the trend of their global peers axing jobs,"" Universum indicated.
Uppermost in the minds of both the business as well as engineering and natural sciences students when picking an employer to work for is ""a friendly work environment"". ""Professional training and development"" comes next, followed by ""secure employment"". ""High future earnings"" is surprisingly placed only fourth.
But while female students put ""flexible working conditions"" and ""ethical standards"" among their top 10 ""preferred employer attributes"", these don't figure on the male students' top 10 list. The latter have meritocracy and ""inspiring purpose"", which are absent on the female students' list.
Universum noted that Singaporean students are increasingly concerned about job security, as layoffs are reported to be on the rise in recent years. ""In the past three years of this survey, among all types of students, the importance of the employer attribute ""secure employment"" has risen from 7th in 2014 to 5th in 2015, and now up to 3rd for 2016.""
Asked about their most important career goal after they graduate, two in three of the students deemed ""to have work/life balance"" a top priority.
The next most desired career goal is ""to be secure or stable in my job"", followed by ""to be dedicated to a cause or to feel that I'm serving the greater good"".

Former speaker of the house Abdullah Tarmugi has only one word to describe founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew - ""proper"".
""He was always 'Proper',"" Mr Abdullah said in remembrance of Mr Lee one year after his passing. ""This single description, for me, somehow encapsulates everything the man was.""
The former speaker was one of three people who spoke on Wednesday at the old Parliament House - now the Arts House - where present and former members of parliament turned up to remember Mr Lee. The others were Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu and former deputy prime minister Wong Kan Seng.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and many of his Cabinet members were also at the parliamentarians' remembrance ceremony.
In his speech, Mr Abdullah said: ""(Mr Lee's) sense of integrity and of right and wrong, his discipline and standards, his vision. Everything must be done right; nothing was too small or too unimportant.""
He recalled an incident during the Sars outbreak in 2003, when everyone who entered parliament premises must have their temperatures checked at the gate. One day, as Mr Lee and his security officers approached Parliament, the Cisco guards were unsure whether to check his temperature. Mr Lee rolled down his window screen and insisted that they do.
""Mr Lee could have just driven through without being checked,"" Mr Abdullah said. ""But he didn't because he knew it was improper for him to do so.""
Another thing the former speaker remembered was the need for MPs to ask the Speaker or the Leader of the House for leave when they could not attend Parliament for a day because of other commitments.
""Only Mr Lee made it a point to write a note to the speaker every time he was unable to come to Parliament for the day,"" Mr Abdullah said. ""To my recollection, no other MP did this.""
He said that with Mr Lee, ""you see what you get; you get what you see"". ""The smiles are real, whether alone or in front of others. I've seen too many whose smiles are forced and only for public consumption.""
Mr Wong, in his speech, recalled a 35-year-old Mr Lee saying: ""This will be an era which will light up the dark pages of the history of Singapore.""
The former deputy prime minister said that the page was turned during Mr Lee's leadership. ""His legacy lives on in Singapore, in the values, principles and high standards that moved Singapore from third world to first.""
Mr Wong said that Mr Lee's strategic long-term vision was legendary, but he also paid attention to details. Ministers were encouraged to drive their own cars instead of using drivers. In this way, Mr Lee said, they could then see the road condition for themselves. They could notice things that needed attending to by PWD (Public Works Department).
Ms Fu said that Mr Lee and his team left subsequent generations a rich legacy - strong institutions and systems based on multi-racialism, self-reliance, meritocracy, integrity and rule of law - ""values and principles that remain precious and important to us in this present day"".
Wednesday's parliamentarians' remembrance ceremony coincided with the launch of The Parliament in Singapore History exhibition in the old Parliament House.
""The exhibition traces Singapore's judicial and legislative history, from the colonial days to 1999 when this building last housed the Parliament,"" Ms Fu said.
Guided tours of the exhibition for the public are available from March 24 to May 29. More information on the tours can be found at www.thearthouse.sg.

","   FOR the Maersk Group, a conglomerate of worldwide businesses focusing on the shipping and energy industries, Singapore is the only place outside Denmark where all its business units are represented. The group operates in some 130 countries and is headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Maersk has been established in Singapore since 1975 and has grown its operations here substantially in tandem with Singapore's growth as an international maritime centre. It is the top Singapore Registry of Ships (SRS) client with about 140 vessels and the Singapore office operates over 100 of its vessels.
Significantly, despite the current gloom and doom in the global shipping industry, the number of Maersk employees in Singapore remains stable at around 650.
Says Rene Piil Pedersen, group representative Singapore/Asia-Pacific, Maersk Group and managing director, AP Moller Singapore Pte Ltd: ""With all of our major businesses having activities in Singapore there will always be some who are scaling down while others are growing their number of employees, and right now we are growing the number of staff in Maersk Line's commercial office based in Singapore as part of a restructuring of the business in South-east Asia.
""Even though the company was formally established in 1975, our vessels have been calling at Singapore since the late 1920s.""
Mr Pedersen sees shipping companies playing a strong role in Singapore's growth as an international maritime centre (IMC) going forward.
He says maritime Singapore is built on three pillars: competitiveness, that is, a globally competitive taxation scheme, ease of doing business, etc; stability, ie, a consistent, long-term transparent government policy executed by competent government and institutions, rule of law and strong anti-corruption policy; and finally multicultural meritocracy, which gives access to talent with an international and competitive mindset.
""This gives a very strong fundament for Singapore as an IMC, and this is also the reason why the Maersk Group has registered close to 140 vessels and drilling rigs with a value of some US$12 billion in Singapore,"" he says.
The Maersk Group in Singapore is made up of a diversified portfolio of business units, ranging from containers, tankers, offshore drilling, port terminals, oil, tugs to logistics businesses. It employs around 650 people in Singapore - all white-collared jobs.
""Today, our container business, Maersk Line, in Singapore is made up of AP Moller Singapore, our ship owning and ship management company; Liner Operation Cluster for Asia Pacific is responsible for global stowage of the entire Maersk Line fleet and operations of vessels in Asia-Pacific ports; as well as a commercial office which oversees business activities in the South-east Asia market,"" says Mr Pedersen.
""Singapore is key to us as one of the main transhipment ports in South-east Asia; as well as our trusted supplier for our offshore oil and gas businesses. For instance, Maersk Drilling has around 30 years of relationship with Keppel Fels in the construction of offshore rigs, of which the most recent project was for three ultra-harsh environment jack-ups worth around US$2 billion. We have also awarded a contract to Sembcorp Marine through Maersk Oil to build topsides worth US$1 billion for the Culzean Field development in the North Sea,"" he adds.
Established in 1904 the Maersk Group employs about 89,000 people globally today. Its 2015 revenue stands at US$40.3 billion with an underlying profit of around US$3.1 billion. It comprises five core business units:Maersk Line, the world's largest container shipping company; Maersk Oil, an international oil and gas company with a track record spanning more than 40 years.Maersk Drilling, which supports global oil and gas production by providing high efficiency drilling services to oil companies around the world;APM Terminals, which provides port and inland infrastructure to drive global commerce;APM Shipping Services comprising Maersk Tankers, which owns and operates a large fleet of refined oil product tankers; Svitzer, which provides towage and related marine services throughout the world; Damco, a provider of freight forwarding and supply chain management services; and Maersk Supply Service, a leading provider of global marine services.
""At the Maersk Group we have a distinctive set of group core values which drives the way we do business, namely: Constant Care, Humbleness, Uprightness, Our Employees and Our Name. These values laid the foundation for success over the years. They remain constant despite the complex and challenging business environment we are faced with today, and allow us to make sound decisions in the spirit of our Maersk founders,"" says Mr Pedersen.
Asked how Maersk is handling the current downturn in the global shipping environment, he says: ""2016 started on a rocky note. Container freight rates are extremely low and an oil price of US$30-40 per barrel has pointed to a challenging start. In spite of the adverse market conditions and headwinds, it is important to stress that all Maersk core businesses were profitable in 2015. This is a result of our business units having taken measures to further improve competitiveness and we will continue to do so this year while maintaining activity level so that we are in the best position to serve our customers.""
The Maersk Group also has the flexibility and financial strength to capitalise on the downturn through its strong balance sheet as a conglomerate. It is confident that its current market leadership in the shipping and energy industries will allow it to make investments for future growth by building on its key strengths and focusing on its customers and innovation.
Looking ahead, Mr Pedersen says that the global economy is challenged by both cyclical as well as structural changes and at the same time he sees emergence of disruptive innovations across different industries.
""All this, of course, influence the Maersk Group, whether we are talking about low growth rates, changes in trade flows or behavioural patterns and expectations from our customers. However, our company was established in 1904 and this is not the first time that we have weathered a storm.
""Our focus is on delivering a great service to our customers combined with a strong business performance and a differentiation through technology and innovation makes me a strong optimist on the future of the Maersk Group both in Singapore and the rest of the world.""

Singapore
AS Singapore turns 51, business leaders here are under no illusions about the challenges that lie ahead in the next half of her century. But the Republic can still grow as a nation, if it is prepared to change mindsets, be open to new ideas, and make necessary adjustments, say 51 business leaders polled in The Business Times' ""Singapore beyond 50"" survey on their views and aspirations for the country's future.
When asked if Singapore's economy would grow rapidly again beyond 2020, 65.4 per cent of respondents say that it depends on whether Singapore succeeds in restructuring while 21.2 per cent say that it depends on whether the external economy picks up. Some 7.4 per cent are downbeat - they think not.
A more hopeful respondent, the head of a human resources (HR) consulting firm, calls for a new growth engine for the economy. ""Until several decades ago, we were a developing economy. Today, many of our industries have matured. Innovation and entrepreneurship should be encouraged.""
Another respondent, the spokesman of a HR solutions provider, points to an increase in young entrepreneurs who have greater access to resources, are more well-travelled, and who dare to ""try, fail and then try again"". She says: ""There is a lot of potential if they are supported.""
The chief of a professional services firm is confident that the new generation of Singaporeans can remodel the country in a ""more socially liberal direction"" - without damaging its economic success. This is even as he trusts that the days of Singapore's strong growth are long past.
Respondents, when asked if Singapore's current generation can surpass the achievements of the past generation's, appear conflicted. Half of them express confidence that the current generation can better itself from the one before, but the other half feel that it is becoming harder to do so.
A finance professor, who is also the director of a research centre, says that the ""best days of easy growth"" are behind Singapore. He cites contemporary challenges around the bend, among them ""the more difficult quality-of-growth"" type of growth.
The vice-president of an energy advisory firm adds that Singapore's success story has led to ""a certain greediness and complacency"" among the rich and created a big gap between the rich and the poor.
He says: ""For a growing number of people, the bar of success is now hanging too high - they might not even try to jump.""
A lack of agility will pose a hurdle too, says a cybersecurity firm director. ""As a smaller country, it was structurally easier to adjust and revamp our economic strategy. As a more developed country, it will be more challenging to be nimble to take an economic pivot to grow the country.""
That Singaporeans are becoming ""soft"" is one more challenge. The founder of a fish farm says: ""We are producing weaker and lazier Singaporeans.""
The chairman of an engineering company adds that the younger generations born in better times are less resilient, and less prepared to struggle and work hard.
A law firm deputy chairman is more sympathetic, lamenting that the rise in cost of assets has outstripped the rise in salaries. ""The next generation can make a decent living, but many may end up spending most of their incomes on mortgage payments"".
Amid the challenges cited, a top executive at an infrastructure conglomerate notes that it is ""unfair"" to compare the current generation with the previous generation, as both differ in terms of nature and events. ""Today, things like the digital wave and tech disruption will change the ballgame and order of traditional management.""
Creativity is not generation-specific, adds the chief of a charitable trust. ""Younger people coming up will be successful but in a different way.""
By the same token, Singapore should not measure herself against historical costs, the head of a non-profit business association says. ""Instead, we should measure ourselves against what is relevant for us at any given time. Singapore must change and evolve to stay relevant to the rest of the world.""
The task is proving immense. A recruitment firm founder says that ""drastic"" changes in the global economic, social and political landscape give no guarantees to what the future holds. However, he is assured of the calibre of current Singapore leaders - a result of ""succession planning by past visionary leaders"" - and their guidance.
Aside from political stability, the nation's other attributes are its corruption-free system, racial and religious harmony, and economic success and meritocracy, according to respondents who were asked to list the most important features that define Singapore.
If growth is slowing, it is nothing unique and in fact a narrative among developed nations, notes the chief of a sales performance company in the survey. With a larger global population, the competition is greater than before, he adds. ""Change in the new normal, and we cannot take for granted that all change will be positive.""

IT IS ""not surprising"" that race is still a factor during elections in Singapore and will remain so for years to come, and it's a fact that minority candidates are at a disadvantage with all other things being equal.
As he presented the government's position on the need to ensure a minority president is elected periodically, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong pointed out that Singapore became a nation because of its strength as a multi-racial society.
While Singapore has made ""significant progress"" in becoming a united nation, the country is not a homogeneous society and race still matters when it comes to personal choices such as choosing a life partner, best friends or business partners.
Mr Lee noted that the president, as the head of state who holds the second key over Singapore's reserves and public sector appointments, is a symbol of the nation, with whom every Singaporean must be able to identify. ""Every citizen has to know that someone of his community can become president, and in fact from time to time, does become president whether he is Chinese, Malay, Indian, Eurasian, or some other race,"" he explained.
Singapore has not had a Malay president since the elected presidency system was introduced 25 years ago. Yusof Ishak, who served from 1965 to 1970, was Singapore's first and only Malay president to date.
The last minority president was SR Nathan, who served two terms from 1999 to 2011 but was elected unopposed both times.
Before presidents were elected, Parliament chose the head of state and Singapore had presidents from all races. Besides Mr Ishak, there was Benjamin Sheares (Eurasian), Devan Nair (Indian) and Wee Kim Wee (Chinese).
A nine-member constitutional commission headed by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon announced last Thursday that it had completed its review of the elected presidency system and submitted its report to Mr Lee. The group was tasked to review three things: to consider how the president can give more weight to the advice of the Council of Presidential Advisers, to update the criteria for presidential candidates; and to ensure that minorities regularly have a chance to be elected as president.
Mr Lee said the government accepts the main recommendations in principle and it is studying the report and will release it soon.
A White Paper will be published on how the changes will be implemented before a constitutional amendment is tabled in Parliament. The House will also have a full debate on the changes.
Mr Lee spent the bulk of his time on this subject discussing the planned move to introduce a special provision for minority candidates to become president.
In his prepared remarks, he shared how Canada, an English-speaking country with a large French minority (22 per cent), alternates between an English and a French-speaking governor-general.
New Zealand, with Asian immigrants and a Maori indigenous population, regularly appoints a non-white as the governor-general.
Switzerland, which has three main ethnic groups (German, French and Italian) and a population where two in three are Swiss-German, has an unwritten understanding that its seven-member Federal Council includes representatives from the minority ethnic groups. The Swiss presidency rotates annually among the council members.
""In all these countries, nobody questions the fitness of the head of state, just because there is an arrangement or special effort to find one belonging to the minority group,"" said Mr Lee.
In Singapore, Mr Lee cited the findings of a recent survey that showed how each race would prefer their own to be president, and most would accept a president of a different race.
He added that if Singapore's next several presidents are also not Malay, the Malay community would ""start to feel uneasy"", and understandably so.
""Likewise with Indian Singaporeans, if we do not have an Indian president for a long time after Mr Nathan, the minorities will ask (if they) have a place in Singapore (and are they) truly equal?"" said the prime minister.
Mr Lee noted the views of different camps on this issue. There are some who fear that if there is an explicit arrangement to ensure a minority president, this would compromise the principle of meritocracy.
On the other hand, the non-Chinese also do not want a minority president if it is perceived that standards have been lowered for the sake of electing a minority candidate.
""This makes it a delicate problem - it's legally hard to draft, politically sensitive to explain, and psychologically takes time to accept. But it is a real problem, and we have to solve it,"" he pointed out.

THERE must be a mechanism that can be triggered if Singapore has not had a minority president after five consecutive full terms, said the constitutional commission set up to review the elected presidency in its report.
As each presidential term here lasts up to six years, a period of five full terms will span 30 years.
Even as the group noted the ""strong justifications"" to ensure minority representation by Singapore's head of state, it also made two key points: Having such a safeguard in place would not undermine meritocracy, and that the eligibility criteria for prospective candidates from any race should never be lowered.
The commission, headed by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, ""agrees emphatically"" that while a race-blind society is the only legitimate aspiration for Singapore, there is a ""pressing need"" to ensure that no ethnic group is shut out of the presidency even as the country progresses towards that ideal.
""Singapore cannot yet be considered a post-racial society. This is a reality that must be faced, even if it is one that is not to be endorsed,"" the commission said.
During the public hearings earlier this year, one contributor who strongly disagreed with the introduction of safeguards to ensure minority representation accepted that it was ""worrying"" that Singapore has not had a Malay president in two generations.
The last Malay president was the late Yusof Ishak, who was Singapore's first head of state from 1965 until he died while in office in 1970.
The last minority president was the late SR Nathan, an Indian who served for two terms from 1999 to 2011. The current president is Tony Tan Keng Yam, a Chinese.
The commission categorised the relevant racial groups in Singapore as such: Chinese, Malay, and Indian and other communities.
In its proposal, the commission suggested that if a person from one racial group has not been elected as president after five straight terms, only candidates from that particular racial group will be allowed to contest the next election. However, if there aren't any qualified candidates during that election, the contest will then be opened to people from all racial groups.
The reserved election for that particular minority would then be deferred to the next election, and the practice of holding a reserved election will continue until a candidate from that racial group is eventually elected as president.
Provisions should also be made to cater for a situation where more than one racial group is eligible for reserved elections at a given point in time, the commission said.
This is a situation which should be recognised and catered for by prioritising among the groups that have not been represented in the presidency.
The commission also made the point that candidates from the Malay, Indian or other communities can still stand in open elections when the minority mechanism is not triggered.
The proposed mechanism need not be triggered at all if free and unregulated elections are able to produce presidents from different ethnicities.
In a statement issued shortly after the report was published, Law Minister K Shanmugam said that the government had asked the Attorney-General for advice on certain aspects of the commission's proposals to ensure representation of all the major races.
He added that the government would announce its position once it has received and considered the attorney-general's advice.
Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is Acting Prime Minister as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is overseas, said in a statement that he was ""heartened"" that some, including Singaporeans from minority races, have argued passionately and sincerely that meritocracy should be upheld by electing the best person, regardless of race.
""This response shows how far we have come in recognising the importance of the concept of meritocracy in Singapore. Nevertheless, we have always made sure that even as we practice meritocracy, all races in Singapore feel that they have a place and equal opportunities,"" he said.
""Most people will accept that our GRC (Group Representation Constituency) system, ensuring a minimum number of minority race members of parliament, was the right thing to do, and has indeed contributed to maintaining our harmonious multi-racial society, though some had objected when it was first introduced. Similarly, every community in Singapore must feel that a member of their community has a chance to become president.""

THE report by a group of nine Singaporeans tasked to review the elected presidency system was made public on Wednesday, containing a raft of proposals that are likely to significantly change the landscape of future elections for the highest office in the land.
The Constitutional Commission, headed by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, took six months to complete its work and submitted the 154-page document to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three weeks ago.
The government is studying the recommendations and will publish a White Paper with its detailed responses on September 15. The plan is to later table a Constitutional Amendment Bill in parliament and have a full debate in the House on the issue.
In a letter to CJ Menon on Wednesday, PM Lee thanked him and the commission once again for their work and said the government ""accepts in principle"" the main recommendations of the report.
Among the commission's many proposals is to have a mechanism in place to guarantee that people from all racial groups in Singapore have the opportunity to become head of state.
If any racial group has not been represented after five consecutive full terms, the next election will be reserved exclusively for candidates from that particular racial group. The racial groups categorised by the commission are the Chinese, Malay, and Indian & other communities. Each presidential term in Singapore lasts a maximum of six years, so a period of five terms would be about 30 years.
A crucial point made by the committee is that the eligibility criteria for candidates in a reserved election should not be lowered for any reason, as doing so would undermine meritocracy. ""So long as these criteria remain sufficiently stringent, they will continue to serve their critical function of allowing only persons with the necessary experience and expertise for the job to qualify for the office of President,"" the commission said in its report.
Another significant proposal on the table is to beef up the eligibility criteria for prospective candidates, to factor in the growth of Singapore's economy and the size of its reserves over the past 25 years since the elected presidency was first introduced.
The report stated that private sector candidates, who currently must be a chairman or CEO of a Singapore-incorporated company with at least S$100 million in paid-up capital, should be the ""most senior executive"" of a company with a minimum of S$500 million in shareholders' equity in order to make the cut.
This new threshold of S$500 million ""should be reviewed periodically"" to adjust for changes in the economic environment, the commission said.
Based on this new criteria, only two of the four candidates at the last presidential election in 2011 - the eventual winner Tony Tan Keng Yam, and former NTUC Income chief Tan Kin Lian - would have qualified.
The other two candidates that year were former People's Action Party member of parliament Tan Cheng Bock and former senior civil servant Tan Jee Say.
BT understands that Dr Tan Cheng Bock's tenure as non-executive chairman of Chuan Hup Holdings would not have met the criteria of being a senior official who actively runs the company. He also did not manage the company, and it also did not have S$500 million in shareholders' equity.
As for Mr Tan Jee Say, he had cited his experience as regional managing director of AIB Govett, which he said at the time did not have paid-up capital of S$100 million, but managed assets in excess of that amount.
Under the revised criteria, he will not qualify because he didn't manage the company and it didn't have S$500 million shareholders' equity.
In 1993, 158 companies in Singapore met the S$100 million paid-up capital requirement. Raising the qualifying threshold to S$500 million shareholders' equity will include at least 691 companies, with the actual number possibly being much higher.
This is because about 80 per cent of Singapore-incorporated companies, some of which may also have S$500 million shareholders' equity, do not file their financial statements with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.
Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is Acting Prime Minister as Mr Lee is in Laos for the Asean Summit, said it is ""timely"" to update the eligibility criteria now.
""Our GDP has grown more than five times and our economy is more complex compared to 25 years ago. Our CPF balances and official foreign reserves are now seven times larger. The scale and complexity of the president's responsibilities have therefore consequently grown,"" he said in a statement.
The third and final aspect that the commission was asked to study was how to strengthen the role and powers of the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA), the high-level body that advises the president in the exercise of his custodial and discretionary powers.
The commission proposed that the president be required to consult the CPA before exercising discretion on all fiscal matters related to Singapore's reserves, as well as on key public service appointments. Currently, the president need only do so for some such matters.
In the event the president's final decision goes against that of the CPA's advice, the commission also proposed that the decision be subject to a parliamentary override.
On this note, the commission wants the council's views to be given more weight because ""the stronger the CPA's support for the president's decision, the more difficult it should be for parliament to undo that decision"".
As the CPA would have a much larger role, the commission feels it should have two extra members, which would take the total to eight. And when these members are re-appointed, it should be for a six-year term, rather than the four years currently.
While PM Lee has said the government ""accepts in principle"" the main recommendations of the report, he expressed some reservations about the commission's suggestion that the government revert to a system where the president is elected by parliament. He noted that this is a matter beyond the commission's original terms of reference.
""While I appreciate the commission's reasons for this suggestion, as the government has pointed out even when the scheme was first conceived, it would be difficult for a president to exercise custodial powers over the reserves and public service appointments, and veto proposals by the government, without an electoral mandate,"" he said.

There is no secret formula to becoming a C-suite executive, but there are things you can do to tip the scales in your favour. First, don't be afraid to take risks and challenge yourself. Second, embrace the opportunity to gain cross-functional experience in order to understand how a business operates from different perspectives. Finally, in today's global work environment, be culturally aware. Throughout your career you will encounter people from all over the world. Your ability to understand those with different cultural values, beliefs and perceptions can have a significant impact on your success in your organisation and the industry. Gery Messer

Listen, learn and act - that is one of the most significant lessons that leaders everywhere should discover. After 28 years of international experience, I have found this to be a philosophy that transcends borders. Being a C-suite executive puts me at the helm of a company and effective communication is at the core of what I do for people to stay and business to thrive. At CenturyLink, I believe in making things happen through our people, and finding the best talent for each specific role. But that is not enough. Aspiring leaders need to maintain an open-minded, adaptable and innovative mindset. After all, change is the only constant and we can only expect more of that as workplaces transform.
Philip Yuen

IN this digital age, the role of C-suite leaders is ever-changing. As disruptive technologies aggressively permeate our life and work, leaders need to build relevant capabilities to keep pace - ability to handle increased complexity, adaptability, agility, keen digital understanding, and resilience and confidence in the face of disruption.
Organisation structures are becoming flatter and more diverse, with a trend towards a ""network of teams"" where teamwork becomes paramount for business sustainability and growth. Today's C-suite leaders must be able to motivate diverse teams and inspire loyalty. There should also be a shift from being a supervisor towards being a coach and mentor to attract, inspire and retain great people in the growing war for talent.
Another critical skill is the ability to collaborate. With organisations evolving rapidly from being vertically integrated to networks and eco-systems, groups of leaders need to work together in new ways, including collaborating across generations, geographies, functions, and internal and external teams.
Victor Mills

MY advice for aspiring leaders is to take every opportunity offered by their employers to gain international work experience. Spending a year or two working in Asean member countries would be especially beneficial.
It will enhance knowledge of a growing region that Singapore needs to understand better to sustain its own economy. It will also improve those vital communications and teamwork skills necessary to progress and succeed. Once in leadership positions, get out of the way of talented team members. Free them up to succeed. Focus always on removing any obstacles team members come across which impede success. Don't micro-manage.

A BUSINESS leader in Singapore is marrying the history and sturdy traditions of the West with the technological innovations and economic explosions of the East. Whether handling owners, customers or suppliers, local or foreign, he/she must first be able to interpret the one to the other. This interpretative relationship is especially important between employees from different cultures.
Good communications, essential for the C-suite executive, require vision and imagination. When neither employer nor employee exhibit much loyalty to the other, retaining good employees becomes a priority.
Sam Egerton

LEADERSHIP is one of the toughest capabilities to perfect; beyond technical skills, it is equally important for business leaders to develop credibility for themselves, to hold a clear vision of the firm's future and to possess a certain level of mental dexterity. Those who recognise human capital as an integral asset, however, truly hold the key to success. In order to sustain performance, innovation and productivity growth, top leaders must be invested in managing and developing talent internally, and align these talents to strategic business priorities. Such a need for a coherent talent development framework is particularly vital for leaders in Singapore, a nation facing a fast-ageing population and talent shortage.

DIVERSITY of thinking is what counts. Obtaining a broader view with input from people of all levels and backgrounds. Building a culture of evidence-based decision making. Looking at situations from multiple angles. Constantly challenging yourself when making decisions.
Leaders must be able to demonstrate IQ and EQ while developing and implementing this diversity of thinking. Many executives believe that an international job or a six-month transfer to a cross-functional team is enough. But these don't cut it if the time was spent studying and not forming diverse relationships and new ways of thinking. Applying experiences and skill sets to strategy and execution is key.
Karl Hamann

I THINK having an international perspective is critical for any C-suite executive given Singapore's prominent place in the global economy. Personally speaking, I've had the opportunity to work in five different countries during my career and this experience has helped me in terms of both humanity and humility. Working across political, social and cultural lines provides executives with a better understanding of the differences not only in markets but also in people, whether they are your colleagues or your customers. Likewise, you quickly realise that the wisdom of what makes good leadership is not based in one country or culture.
Terry O'Connor

Courts Asia Limited
I HAVE lived and worked in Singapore for over 20 years. Through personal experience and observation of successful peers, being culturally sensitive and embracing the ""kampong"" spirit where family and community ties are strong are necessary ingredients for success.
The relatively high cost of doing business here means that being aligned to the national productive agenda and the ability to drive productivity on all fronts, from human capital to space management, will make a difference.
With an increasingly mobile workforce, HRM cannot be a functional responsibility. It is very much a responsibility for every C-suite executive. In Singapore, respect for authorities tend to be given than earned on the onset. The flipside is that it can be lost quickly if you do not walk the talk.
Eric Lew
Executive Director
Wong Fong Industries
BESIDES experience and qualifications, which are a given, I reckon, yes, C-suites need a certain X factor.
In my attempt to dissect this ""X-factor"", 3 Cs come to mind:
1. Clarity - A good corporate leader has clarity of thought and purpose. The hard work by a C-suite executive is not in the doing but the thinking.
By thinking through a subject thoroughly, and asking the right mentors/advisers, he/she is able to offer clarity and direction as a leader.
2. Courage - A good C-suite leader makes decisions after deliberation and stand by his/her decisions. They can be wrong sometimes, but at least they take a stand and the people can follow.
3. Curiosity - Because of the speed of changes in society, economy and technology, a C-suite leader has to learn new skills and knowledge relentlessly. Someone who is curious will always have the capacity to learn and adapt, a very necessary skill in today's business climate.
Daniel Soh

THERE are many attributes a C-suite executive has to have, but I believe integrity is a basic virtue that any leader must possess before we evaluate his/her capabilities. As Warren Buffet once said "" . . . in looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy."" If you don't have the first, the other two will kill you. Secondly, I'm strongly of the view that the personal characteristic of ""inquisitiveness"" is what a leader must have. In the current VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) world, you need this to stay ahead of the game, keep informed, and remain intellectually sharp. Lastly, what a C-suite executive must do to be successful is to continually create conditions for people to perform.

Henkel Singapore
WITH our global centre of excellence in Singapore, we emphasise having strong leaders at all levels of our organisation. This requires being a role model of Henkel's Leadership Principles, which are: lead myself, lead team, lead performance, lead stakeholders and lead change. In line with these principles, we expect our leaders to actively manage performance and change, treat all colleagues fairly and with trust, encourage ideas and dialogue among our culturally diverse and international team, and recognise good performance. I firmly believe that an inclusive and collaborative leadership approach is crucial for taking a company from good to great.
Alexis Lanternier
CEO
Lazada Singapore
REGARDLESS of the industry, I believe there are a few key character traits that will define any aspiring business leader: having hands-on experience, and an eagerness to learn strategic thinking and take risks.
Managing a shop while I was a category manager at Amazon gave me priceless first-hand experience of the industry, and having the opportunity to work at the Boston Consulting Group taught me how to think strategically, a key point in building any business.
Having a healthy appetite for risk is also important. I chose to leave a very comfortable career to join Lazada, which was still a young startup at the time, because I believed in the potential of this company and Southeast Asia, and how I could contribute to it. Lazada has grown immeasurably since then, but I would not have been able to be a part of it if I did not have that initial appetite for risk.

SINGAPORE is a microcosm of global culture. A C-suite executive here must therefore have the ability to build multicultural teams and harness cross-cultural competence. If a global mindset is about embracing divergent ideas and experiences and turning that diversity into a differentiating asset, one can see it at play in Singapore. A C-suite executive must embody the country's business philosophy around excellence, ease and transnational nature of business. In the digital era, where growth is about reimagining the art of the possible with new ideas and fast-evolving technologies, a C-suite executive must be adept at anticipating and managing change.

THE key is to own your career trajectory - it worked for me. Don't just dream big - make it happen by making sure your managers know your aspirations, and enlisting them in your development plan.
Getting the right advice is also important so choose your personal board of directors wisely, including leaders with skills you want to develop or who have done the job before. Nothing beats experience, so roll up your sleeves and work on projects that enhance your understanding of the industry or market.
Perhaps most importantly, continue to develop an authentic professional brand - one that can extend your influence as you develop as a leader.

AS organisations become leaner, there will be growing demand for leadership skills at every level and not just at the C-suite. Future leaders need to adapt to and work in a fast-changing, globally-connected environment. This requires innovative thinking, forward planning and the willingness to forge new paths. But above all, they must remain humble, lead by example and have empathy for people across all levels.
This is why organisations should provide employees with opportunities to build skills that can help them professionally and personally. At IHH Healthcare, we offer career development initiatives that include global talent exchanges, mentorship programmes with senior management and a clear career progression pathway.

THE need for efficiency, agility and innovation calls for a changed mindset from every individual and organisation. Business leaders have to accept that their role is changing; they are no longer the sole decision-makers.
Rather, today's C-suites are facilitators, enabling the exchange of ideas and fostering team collaboration to ensure the organisation benefits from the combined talent force. To play the role well, future leaders will need to acquire strong communication skills, diversify their knowledge base, exercise trust and transparency, and uphold the spirit of meritocracy.

I BELIEVE having a high degree of emotional intelligence is extremely important for C-suite leaders. On the one hand, you need to have self-awareness, self-confidence, emotional self-control and adaptability. At the same time, you must be able to recognise and understand other people's emotions and manage relationships. One of the key characteristics that sets CXOs apart from other leaders is their ability to ""read"" people effectively.
There are a number of ways to increase your emotional intelligence - playing team sports is one great example. In high-school and college, I played handball at a state level, which really sharpened my skills as a strong team player. Interestingly, a study by EY and espnW found that 52 per cent of female C-suite executives played sport at the university level, compared to 39 per cent of women at other management levels.

HOW do you teach someone to ""think on his feet"" when faced with adversity, to not panic, to adapt and find solutions? When faced with challenges, too many C-suite execs are morbidly fearful of breaking the law or making mistakes. They tend to be over-cautious in reacting. Leaders must experience the pain of failure, and learn to take decisive action in face of adversity.
A tolerant corporate environment and opportunities to experience real-time action will nurture competent leaders who are brave and quick-thinking. A company culture of allowing mistakes will enable the cultivation of C-suite leaders who are not only academically smart but also operationally savvy.
Matt Harris

AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd
A C-SUITE executive should be an aspirational leader, who leads a team with diverse but complementary talents towards the overarching organisational vision. They also must have the pulse on the ground - growing ideas from bottom up, and taking a personal interest in realising employees' potential.
A CEO does not own all of the good ideas, so it is important to embrace a myriad of ideas and insights from different stakeholders. From millennials to the veterans and across different cultures, there is something to learn. Do not shun lateral career movements, as these broaden the continuum of skill sets and one gains a macro perspective of all the moving parts of an organisation.
Above all, a C-suite executive must inspire measured courage amid a culture where there is no fear of failure.
Thomas Wai

HAVING had the privilege of interviewing over 800 candidates for C-suite roles across various industries in Singapore in the last five years, some traits and trends have become apparent. Being a solid C-suite candidate requires a lot more than academic qualifications, industry skill sets, strong networks and global experience - these are hygiene factors.
C-suite candidates need to be highly driven, curious and analytical, strategic thinkers, resilient (especially in times of crisis), and also have the ability to influence stakeholders. It is also key to have an appreciation of people, know how to identify and groom future leaders, and uphold integrity and loyalty. Most importantly, successful candidates understand and appreciate organisational culture. They produce good work through people and groom great people through work.
Mark Billington

AS A leader, apart from having sound strategic counsel, it is important to develop a well-rounded, authentic and inspiring leadership style in order to communicate strategy and business news with confidence and credibility. C-suite leaders also have the responsibility of optimising the performance of other company leaders in order for it to cascade throughout the organisation.
A good leader should always be accessible and frequently invest in talent within the company. This can be demonstrated by establishing a clear feedback route with set objectives and ways to measure growth and development.

SINGAPORE is such a dynamic market, and very often, the regional hub for organisations across industries. Being at the heart of an extremely diverse region, business leaders here need to readily embrace change and accept differences. They need to be able to inspire and lead in a business environment where change is the only constant. To thrive, they need to be able to build strong networks and establish trust in a multi-cultural, multi-faceted landscape.
More importantly, business leaders here have the opportunity to create the market and not just address it. They need to stay ahead of the curve, and help prepare future generations for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

THE basic requirement of C-level executives is to have a good understanding of business fundamentals. In that respect, accounting professionals, trained to speak the language of business, have a natural advantage. Many accounting professionals occupy C-level positions and are adding value to businesses in a diverse range of industries. Beyond technical skills, leadership and people management skills, C-suite executives must also be trustworthy, setting the right tone from the top across the entire organisation and think critically to assess the situation accurately amidst the complexities of today's business world.
With the world changing so rapidly due to technology advancement and a volatile geopolitical environment, CXOs must also adopt a global and agile mindset, remain adaptable and have a good grasp of technology, to be prepared for future challenges.

TO BE a successful leader of the future, one must demonstrate two important traits: First, one must have an understanding of the pace of innovation in their industry and how it impacts their business. Second, one must be able to lead their teams through a broader vision instead of a rigid top-down approach.
As we chart our path to transform the trillion dollar telecom industry at Circles.Life, we focus on coaching our teams on the importance of scenario planning and leading people in a dynamic world.

AN effective C-suite executive must possess key soft skills such as leadership and empathy. In a high-pressure society like Singapore, the fear of failure may hold us back from achieving more. This is why I am always constantly challenging the team at Orange to approach problem-solving in different ways; reminding them that it is alright to fail, as long as they are able to identify the problem and solution quickly. Only by gaining a deeper understanding of one's team can a C-suite executive become an emphatic leader and realise their full potential.
In terms of hard skills, today's increasingly digital economy means that the consummate C-suite executive needs to be able to think and strategise like a digital native. For a small market like ours, it is imperative that C-suite executives be very forward-looking and agile in order to keep pace with technological advancement, anticipate potential disruption, and steer the course for his/her organisation.

TODAY'S environment is very connected, digitally. As such, millennials are well-positioned to thrive in this environment and create their impact and space in the organisation. While Singapore executives have a robust education to build core skills, to succeed in a leadership role, soft skills are critical: Collaboration, proactivity, and an open mind. In addition, overseas assignments are important because few countries operate like us and Singapore businesses need to grow beyond our shores. Therefore, learning about the external environment is vital. What I learned early on in my career was to volunteer for assignments and use any opportunity to practise leadership skills. In this way, you increase your visibility and recognition by your peers and managers as a leader.
Lionel Lim
Vice-President and Managing Director, Asia Pacific and Japan
Pivotal, Inc
THE business landscape today is continually disrupted by newer and smarter technologies. To stay ahead of the innovation curve, a digital mindset is an imperative for business leaders. There should no longer be a question of how IT can support the business but how technology can spearhead innovation. The ability to leverage software and data intelligence will become increasingly important. To this end, today's leaders must have the ability to constantly rethink the business, driving creativity and innovative thinking throughout the organisation. Having the digital mindset is about prioritising agility and speed to market and unlocking the startup mentality to propel business outcomes through technology innovations.
Matthew Johnston
Area Vice-President, ASEAN & Korea

IN a resource-challenged market like Singapore, C-suite executives must drive innovation and be adaptable to thrive in a digital era where speed and operational efficiency bring competitive advantage. They must be data-savvy, and use data as a key strategic asset organisation-wide in this knowledge-driven economy. The establishment of regional economic initiatives such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Asean Economic Community brings new opportunities for growth. In this new economic paradigm, leaders must be able to stay flexible, develop human capital, anticipate and adapt accordingly to changing business needs.
Wong Heng Chew
Country President
Fujitsu Singapore
WITH Singapore's position as a hub for Asia-Pacific, it is crucial for C-suite executives in the country to ""think global, act local"". Leaders will need to have a macroscopic view of not only their business, but also the fast-evolving environment that they are in, and tailor strategies to meet the expectations of local customers. Another aspect which C-suite executives in Singapore have to focus on is attracting and retaining the right talent. With the fourth industrial revolution transforming businesses, there is a skills shortage to meet the demands of the digital era. People will be central to value creation and innovation, so by fostering and developing human talent, C-suite executives can drive their teams to success.
Alex Campbell

My advice to those with big ambitions who are setting out in their careers today: don't try to follow anyone else's path. The days of a linear progression to the senior ranks are largely over and no lines on a CV will be enough to get ahead in a world where many of the top jobs didn't exist 10 years ago. Some of the most successful senior executives are already on their third or fourth career arc and along the way they've stepped into new roles that were far from their comfort zone or obvious skill set. The key is to find your own way, be willing to take leaps and risks, and never hesitate to hustle.
Joshua Yim

Achieve Group
EVERY C-suite executive is expected to have these competencies: casting vision, establishing and assisting execution of go-to-market strategies and forging strategic alliances. As a result, the organisation will drive business results and achieve operational efficiency. However, with the rapid revolutionising of the business landscape through disruptive innovation and the IOT, a capability that holds more importance is to embrace change and lead an organisation to and through change. When a C-suite executive is unable to adapt to the changing world and cannot contribute to the organisation, he or she will cause the organisation to regress and become extinct.

BEING book smart is not the be all and end all of life - being street smart and having international experience are equally important in giving us a broader and deeper perspective. It reduces the myopia we have on things and increases our consideration, tolerance and appetite for diversity to prepare for the future. Having the drive and determination to achieve your goals are also essential. As the iconic catchphrase ""to infinity and beyond"" goes, there's no limit to self-growth; go beyond what you think you are capable of and you will find infinite potential.
Ronald Lee

STRONG business acumen with a proven business track record are a given to make it to the C-suite, along with well-rounded experience including cross-functional stints and overseas exposure.
As an individual climbs the corporate ladder, however, technical and functional expertise begin to matter less than leadership skills.
Fundamentally, corporate leaders need to inspire their workforce to want to perform their best for the company. The biggest and most successful brands in the world are helmed by inspirational leaders such as the late Steve Jobs and Richard Branson. Any corporate executive eyeing the C-suite should therefore aspire to become such an inspirational leader.
There is also this growing phenomenon of the ""social CEO"", where the most influential CEOs have a prominent and engaging social media presence focused on their thought leadership and even personal lifestyle and values. I believe this is an important facet that should be considered to engage the millennials who will soon make up the majority of the workforce.
Yaj Malik

TODAY'S business environment embraces ""innovation"" and ""change"" to stay ahead of disruption and this has become the new normal. As a leader, it is important to inspire, be innovative and be forward-thinking to achieve purpose within the organisation to exceed expectations. Clarity, transparency and data-driven capabilities are essential to enable innovation-led growth. Having an agile outlook and the ability to navigate ambiguity reveals the entrepreneurial instinct. This is especially crucial as Singapore positions itself as the regional centre of excellence for the formation of the Asean Economic Community. Here, leaders have to realign their benchmarks for success; going beyond the dollar chase to focus on building sustainable businesses that are ready for a more complex global marketplace.
Dora Hoan
Group CEO
Best World International Ltd
I FEEL that international exposure, cross-functional experience and specialised skills are what you need to reach the C-suite, but it actually takes a very different set of skills to be an effective C-suite executive. To be a successful leader, one must have the vision and commitment, know the business inside out, to take it to new heights. The ability to make the right judgement and decisions, ability to build effective business models and strategise; the ability to spot and retain talents, invest in training and groom them, are of fundamental importance too. Different times and different circumstances call for different leadership skills. A successful C-suite executive should be one with good foresight, able to make timely changes and adjustments, improve or improvise and guide his team towards a common goal, leading them to business excellence.
Robin C Lee
Group COO
Bok Seng Group
IT is hardly surprising that Singaporean CXOs have more overseas exposure compared to others as our market is simply too limited to support top management development. While others have the option of building their career within a capacious territory, Singaporean CXOs must venture out to gain wider perspectives and business management skills. Besides the usual leadership virtues, corporate leaders in today's connected and easily disrupted world need to be diligent in keeping stride with innovations and technologies. CXOs must be acutely aware of the constant and rapid changes, which often call for new business models and operational processes. As Gen Z will be entering the workforce soon, corporate leaders also need to be mindful of their very diverse aspirations and motivations, even when compared to Gen Y.

International SOS
AFTER 10 years in MNCs, I joined International SOS and my first assignment was to build a 24/7 clinic and assistance centre for tourists within 60 days in Yangon, Myanmar. Having the exposure in MNCs was definitely very helpful; but through the years, two important characteristics - passion and belief for what we do and that we can make a difference - have been the cornerstone of our success. I've been with International SOS for over 20 years, and a common thread amongst our leaders is the passion and belief in our vision to protect and save lives, despite times when workloads can be very heavy and the atmosphere intense.
Being in a leadership position also involves serving its various stakeholders - internal and external - building the people, business, organisation and systems to create successes out of them. Remaining humble and having a genuine interest in each individual will also go a long way in establishing connected and authentic relationships and ultimately create value for the organisation.
Wong Ka Vin

FOR C-suites, soft skills like leadership abilities or interpersonal acumen will take precedence over technical and functional expertise. Such skills are even more crucial in Singapore, where digital technologies and evolution have fundamentally altered how we work globally. Sharp foresight to identify and adapt to trends accordingly is also essential for C-suites to lead teams in today's fast-moving economies.
I believe C-suites must understand people are the most vital asset in all organisations. At 1-Net, our staff and engineers are highly valued as they are specially trained to ensure high data availability for our mission-critical infrastructure. Developing and retaining these talents will provide assurance to our customers and enable our long-term growth.
Patrick Liew
Managing Partner
Greenpro Capital
C-SUITE executives are not just custodians of realities but also creators of possibilities. They have to know how to study and interpret trends, evaluate new and emerging developments, and think strategically about how to create a desired future.
In a global economy, they have to go from being I-shaped executives to being T-shaped intrapreneurs. They should have the ability to acquire a wide range of knowledge and expertise to help improve profit, advantage and growth.
As they come to grips with disruptive forces, they have to not only be good firemen, they need to also know how to set up firewalls. Their job is to respond to fire in the marketplace and also be proactive in becoming disruptors and preventing any virus from disrupting their ever-improving business models.
To take the company to a higher level of growth, they have to not only be a leader but also be a leader of leaders. By developing more and better leaders, they can help the company achieve a more sustainable growth.
Jaya Dass

Randstad Singapore
THROUGH my discussions with senior leaders, it has become clear to me that there is no straight path to the top; however, one common factor I have identified is the aspect of perspective. My personal experience comes from starting my own business which, at the time, I didn't see as value-adding towards a corporate career. I realise now that my own perspective evolved through running a full-fledged business, making it commercially viable, and most importantly, learning how to understand people and how the international scope of culture impacts a workplace. Leaders of the future must understand that different factors lead to success in different countries and that even when leading local organisations, leaders must keep an international perspective to maximise productivity and improve the culture of their workplaces.
Lim Soon Hock

PLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd
IN the 1980s and '90s, there were more local CEOs of global MNCs than today. Many of us were groomed through overseas exposure, cross-functional experience and specialist skills, on top of the rare opportunity to work in a highly competitive global MNC environment. As the first local vice-president and managing director of Compaq Computer Asia Pacific, I had the privilege of being a member of the worldwide management team. The experience was invaluable and most fulfilling, to say the least.
Irrespective of how a Singaporean CEO acquires his talent with global exposure, in today's volatile, complex and increasingly borderless business environment, which demands teamwork and reliance on others for a successful outcome, a humble CEO might perform better than one who believes he has the answer to everything.
The more humble a C-suite executive is, the more successful he or she will be. Humility is the X-factor and the currency for success.
Zaheer K Merchant
Regional Director (Singapore & Europe)
QI Group of Companies
TALENTED executives who are outstanding in their job are in abundance, but the je ne sais quoi that sets one apart from others is charisma. Being charismatic usually means having a presence which people gravitate towards. A C-suite executive in Singapore who possesses such a presence knows how to make rational decisions necessary for the business but is equally adept at considering the human aspects, striking a perfect balance. In communication, he/she will be outwardly engaged, look confident while still being accessible and modest in attitude. A charismatic leader is effective and is one who invests in himself/herself for years, knowing full well what to do in every situation and is able to leverage that innate ability to take the business to a new level.
Laletha Nithiyanandan
Managing Director
Behavioural Consulting Group
C-SUITE leaders with MNCs have the advantage of visibility because of Singapore's strategic location and great reputation for ease of doing business. This is a double-edged sword as it makes coming to Singapore on overseas posting very attractive; there will always be people vying for your role. C-suite leaders need to stay visible at head office and know how to highlight their own achievements. Building relationships across the organisation and making time to understand the informal network is important. Negotiate contracts for C-level roles so that you have access to board meetings and frequent travel to head office.
Francis Fong
Managing Director
SAS Singapore
IN the wake of Singapore's Smart Nation initiatives and Industry 4.0, emerging technologies will disrupt business landscapes indefinitely - and so future leaders must be adaptable and agile enough to tackle new challenges. During the ascent to the top, the foundation for operational excellence must be set in stone by focusing systemically on performance for individuals, teams and the organisation. Aspiring leaders should also harness the drive for lifelong learning to develop and hone competencies, as well as inject passion into making a difference, be it within or outside the workplace.
David Leong

TO the C-suite, it's all about managing relationships, charms and outcomes. The pathways may not always be through academic excellence alone. Leadership, ability to narrate, to influence, to perform and to win over stakeholders are key attributes. Taking risks and responsibilities for the outcome of the risks are equally important to success at the C-suite.
Edwin Khew Teck Fook

OUR focus is on grooming engineers to assume C-suite positions across industry sectors. The rapidly evolving disruptive technology landscape has made advanced technology management knowledge a critical requirement for corporate leaders. It will empower them, from leading new product innovation development to large-scale engineering projects implementation. In collaboration with NTUC, IES has launched the Young Engineers Leadership Programme and Advanced Engineers Leadership Programme targeting young and senior engineers respectively, under the Engineers Progression Pathway. These unique programmes offer industry-relevant curriculum, cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural learning opportunities and mentorship by eminent engineers to nurture young engineers into the next generation of future-ready engineering leaders for Singapore.

MOUNTAINEERING tends to attract men and women who are not afraid of extreme challenges to reach the summits of mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world. In order to succeed, mountaineers must be exceedingly driven and many succumb to summit fever, a state of mind in which a person fails to notice dangerous conditions in the attempt to reach the summit. As a result, there are hundreds of dead bodies on the slopes of Everest.
Summit fever doesn't just happen on the mountains. We also experience summit fever at work and in our own lives. Many C-suite executives are so driven to achieve their targets and goals that they don't notice the warning signs until it's too late. C-suite executives must learn not to get too hot and keep their cool.

CHARACTER is key: a leader cannot be a public success, but a private failure. Professor Alex Frino from the University of Wollongong, Australia published a paper on narcissistic CEOs which highlighted how a CEO's character affects the company he leads. When future leaders grasp this point, they'll understand the importance of character-building through real-world experiences, as well as the people they meet and model themselves after. At PSB Academy, we provide ample avenues for our students to mould their character and develop soft skills both inside and outside the classroom. Our Student Affairs and Alumni teams ensure opportunities for students to hold leadership positions on campus to complement a holistic education experience. They also forge industry partnerships, so that students gain access to the networks of thought leaders and industry-ready training programmes to develop their leadership potential, and better compete and thrive in an increasingly challenging future economy.

LEADERSHIP skills are required for any C-suite executive to take the necessary steps in translating the organisation's vision into reality. With effective leadership, all members of the organisation can be assured that the leader is working towards greater benefits, both for their sake and for the organisation. Perhaps what's most critical and essential is - one must be a leader whom employees can trust, as leadership is about leading people to achieve something that they could not on their own. What's more, gaining employees' loyalty and commitment is impossible without the genuine allegiance inspired by true leadership skills.

"," ""Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!""
The Red Queen in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass
CASUAL sexism is something I believe every female has encountered at some point.
Once, an older business leader told me over lunch that Singaporean women are too picky when it comes to their choice of husbands. I responded that having high standards is a good thing - Singaporean men can then step up to the plate. That did not go down too well. Another in the food and beverage line also told me innocently that female staff need to be ""pampered"" with more TLC (tender loving care) as women are always quarrelling among themselves. I nearly choked on my tea. These are nice, well-meaning men, who don't even have a clue that what they said is offensive. This makes addressing these deep-rooted beliefs and mindsets all the more challenging.
The problem is, men are not the only ones who can be sexist. Some women have internalised such ideas over the years, and to this day still believe that their husband's job takes precedence or that females don't make good leaders. But this does not fully explain the lack of outrage among Singapore women regarding the pay gap and female leadership representation. BT Weekend finds out if working women here are unaware, nonchalant or resigned to fate.
Please mind the gap
One study that particularly hits close to home is by NUS Business School's Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations, which found that female directors earned 56.8 per cent of male directors' remuneration on average, indicating a gender pay gap of 43.2 per cent.
Lead author associate professor Marleen Dieleman told The Business Times that the disparity in board pay is due to two reasons: women getting paid less for the same role, and women being relegated to lower-paying roles. She explains: ""The overall pay gap is large mainly because women are rarely present in the highest paying director roles such as CEO or executive chairman.""
Women who did manage to get on boards are observed to be relegated to lower-paying roles even if they are capable, she points out.
The report findings may not be surprising, but it is Singapore women's rather lukewarm response to it that is worrying. Junie Foo, co-founder and chairwoman of BoardAgender, says that women in Singapore are certainly aware of the disparity, but may not want to take it upon themselves to go through the grief of addressing it. ""More often than not, women don't really ask (to be paid more). When they go to their bosses and say they have done this, this and this, they come across as aggressive. It penalises them and perpetuates the situation.""
Not all managers are so enlightened to appreciate assertive women who stand up for themselves. It is a risk not many are willing to take. Trina Liang-Lin, president of the Singapore Committee for UN Women, adds that women tend to believe they will be paid fairly for their effort at work. This usually results in them accepting what is offered without further negotiations.
""I used to think it an 'Asian' thing, but since knowing about the discrepancy in Hollywood - thanks to the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Streep - I now know it's not ... Still, difficult honest talk in shiny offices needs to happen if one believes one isn't being fairly treated.""
Both of these women practise what they preach. At different points in their career, they have had to go to their bosses to talk about pay inequality.
The problem with meritocracy and privilege
Since the study came out, Prof Dieleman has received responses from both sexes. The men, she says, tell her they can't believe this is happening despite all the research that points otherwise, while the women tell her the number of ways they have been overlooked for pay rises and promotions. However, she has received no reaction from anyone who had admitted to contributing to the gap. ""It's hard to think of yourself as possibly discriminating based on gender. Yet, the evidence is overwhelming that it is happening ... I am concerned that, in Singapore, one of our strengths paradoxically also leads to complacency.""
Prof Dieleman is referring to our system of meritocracy, which supposedly rewards people based on their merit. When she presents data on the limited representation of women on boards, she often hears variations of the response: ""But we are a meritocracy, so there is no problem.""
Yet, findings show that those who perceive their organisations as more meritocratic tend to be more biased as they question their own judgements less, she says. The issue of privilege and its ability to cloud a person's judgement is another factor worth examining. Again, this affects both men AND women. For example, women privileged enough to be in workplaces where they are equally rewarded as their male peers sometimes don't think of the gender pay gap as an issue as hey, it doesn't apply to me. While they are entitled to their opinion, it dismisses the concerns of other women out there who are not so lucky. Adds Prof Dieleman: ""We are all privileged in some way and underprivileged in another, and this study is an important reminder not to allow privilege to cloud our judgements.""
Glacial progress is still progress
Even as women's progress continues to be made at a glacial pace, one key piece of advice for aspiring women who want to climb the corporate ladder and be rewarded fairly for it is to be bold. After all, it is this year's International Women's Day theme, in case you missed it: be bold for change. But this is no blind leap into the dark. It has to be tempered with wisdom to not only know your worth, but your limitations as well. Says Florence Ng, managing director and founder of Straits Talent: ""Women should dream big and not let their ambitions be curbed, nor be afraid to ask for help ... Be brave and be realistic.""
Equal pay and greater female leadership representation will hardly be handed to women on a silver platter - it needs to be fought for. This means pushing back against patriarchal beliefs, complacency, and even our own apathy. A good start is simply to support fellow women in the workplace. Be allies, be mentors, be one another's sounding boards; building one another up will lift us all.
It is an uphill journey and there is a long way to go, but as we continue to keep running, I have hope that the generations after us will face a fairer, more equal society.

THIS WEEK'S TOPIC: Should Singapore have a 20 per cent female board directors target? Why should, or shouldn't, gender diversity on corporate boards be mandated?
Vincent Magnenat
CEO, Singapore and Head of Private Banking, Asia
Lombard Odier
I would advocate promoting gender diversity not only in corporate boards but throughout an organisation, putting in place an appropriate framework to empower women at every level.
Workplace culture comes from the top. Since former Lombard Odier managing partner, Anne-Marie de Weck, retired after 20 years in December, we have announced the appointment of Annika Falkengren, one of Europe's most respected female bankers, as a new managing partner.
I don't believe in quotas, but we are actively addressing gender diversity at a Singapore, regional and global level as we see the correlation between diverse boards and overall performance. For example, companies with gender-diverse boards have delivered a 36 per cent better return-on-equity since 2010, according to a MSCI study of the 1,643 firms on the MSCI World benchmark.
Kevin Chow
Chief Executive Officer
Thales in Singapore
MANDATING gender diversity on corporate boards doesn't address the deeper issue of low female representation. Companies first need to recognise capabilities and merit in all employees, regardless of gender. If there are capable female candidates, the onus is on the company to promote fairly, eliminate the glass ceiling and create a supportive culture as these women help drive the business. Thales in Singapore is doing well in this respect - the Executive Committee in Singapore is 25 per cent female; over 30 per cent of employees are women, and we have solid commitments to raise that moving forward.
Audrey Tan
Managing Director, Southeast Asia
Russell Reynolds Associates
It is heartening to see an aspirational target being set and an evolution underway. Balancing diversity with meritocracy and trust seems to be the battle that we are in. In Asia, bringing in board members who are trusted and known to the board are important criteria. Diversity will bring along differences of opinion to the board, which may make a traditional board more resistant to change. Change takes time and unless mandated, the evolution will be slow. With increased complexities and unpredictability in the markets, it is imperative to bring gender diversity into the boardroom to enable effective corporate governance.
Ana Dhoraisingam
CEO, Singapore
PineBridge Investments
LEGISLATION to make it mandatory for companies to have a minimum quota of qualified women on boards is long overdue and a step in the right direction.
I might even argue that the 20 per cent suggested target is even too small and something closer to between 30 per cent and 40 per cent would be more ideal. Moving towards a more inclusive society requires our government and corporate bodies to acknowledge not only gender diversity, but also diversity in all its other forms. Gender diversity on boards can only lead to better decision-making and better business and that is a win-win for corporate leaders and shareholders alike.
Doina Palici-Chehab
Chief Executive Officer
AXA Insurance Pte Ltd
WHILE it is heartening to see more women in boardrooms, more can definitely be done to close the gender gap. I support mandated gender diversity on corporate boards as a means of accelerating progress towards gender parity in the workplace. Sitting on the AXA Group board, which is almost 50 per cent female, I have found that diversity brings a more nuanced view on issues and healthy discussions that can result in better business decisions. Female representation at the top will also inspire the rest of the organisation to be more inclusive, helping to attract and retain talent. This is especially relevant for Singapore's competitive labour market.
Victor Mills
Chief Executive
Singapore International Chamber of Commerce
GENDER, and all forms of diversity are essential for the health of boards and the businesses they direct and guide. The same goes for management teams. This is precisely why this Chamber supports inclusive diversity and the goal of more women on company boards. The Chamber is not a fan of mandated targets in general because of the risks of cynicism and tokenism which often result. Nonetheless, the situation in Singapore is unacceptable. If moral suasion does not produce the desired results then, perhaps, we have no choice but to mandate targets as leading women in government have suggested recently.
Florence Ng
Managing Director & Founder
Straits Talent Private Limited
WHAT do General Motors, PepsiCo and IBM have in common? Women at the helm. Much has been said about successful companies with women on boards performing better. Corporate success stories about board diversity are aplenty. As an open economy built on meritocracy and with a repute for corporate governance, it is therefore critical that we achieve greater female board representation. Yes, we should aim for 20 per cent female board directorship. Is this achievable by 2020? That's ambitious. Hence the proposal to mandate it.
I am a strong advocate of diversity. And not just gender. Gender diversity is but one aspect of diversity. Of equal importance is diversity of skills, experience, industry norms, technical knowledge and leadership styles. Board appointments should be based on merit - which stems from a track record of performance. We should not be led by the need to fill board seats with females so as to fulfil a mandate or simply to tick a box.
Tony Lombardo
CEO Asia
Lendlease
STUDIES have shown that diverse groups make better decisions - diversity which includes gender, nationalities, etc. While managing diversity is harder due to the different perspectives put forward, it ultimately leads to a better outcome. A 20 per cent target is a good starting point to get better board diversity. Diversity & Inclusion is one of the guiding principles that define the way Lendlease does business - it's about encouraging differences and working together to achieve the best outcomes.
Yeoh Oon Jin
Executive Chairman
PwC Singapore
RECENT calls for a 20 per cent female board directors target signal that Singapore needs to move the dial on female representation on boards. While it is important to bear in mind that Singapore is at heart a meritocratic society, I do believe that having a target will help focus efforts towards a tangible diversity goal.
Boards with greater diversity offer a broader range of views and experience, and may better identify potential risks in a fast changing business environment. Clear and transparent disclosure on board diversity (including gender) can be a strategic lever to nudge companies to improve their board diversity and thereby gain a competitive advantage and long-term value for their shareholders.
Andrew Calvert

YES. Businesses here need to stay ahead of the competition - and moving forward in terms of gender diversity not just at the board, but at every level, will help achieve that. To this end, the broader focus needs to be on honing diversity and inclusion competencies in leaders, from training them to be inclusive in problem solving, decision-making, to how they collaborate and lead the talent they manage.
Especially for industries plagued by deep-seated, possibly unconscious biases that put women in the backseat, having strong diversity policies can help attract and retain female talent. And this is made even more pronounced when driven by demonstration from the top.
Bala Swaminathan
President, International
Westpac Banking Corporation
THE case for gender diversity is clear - women in leadership improve diversity of thought, long-term business health and bring EQ into high-stress business environments. More than 60 per cent of our workforce at Westpac are women, as are millions of our 13 million customers, and it is critical we have this representation at a senior level. This week, Westpac turns 200 years, an incredible milestone in Australia's history as Australia's first company. We are very pleased to report that we have 48 per cent women in leadership roles, with the target to reach 50 per cent by the end of 2017.

THERE are pros and cons to instituting such a mandate. While some view it as artificial and unsustainable, others have pointed to global success stories where such a mandate has effectively overcome entrenched historical and cultural biases to drive positive change. Such a mandate would work if there's an accompanying open-mindedness to view women's competencies as they are and not to fill quotas. In engineering, the landscape has changed notably with many new engineering disciplines requiring expertise and skill sets that put both genders on the same level playing field. Women engineers have been making increasingly significant contributions across multiple disciplines. Recognition of these changes during corporate board elections is crucial in realising long-term business competitiveness.

AS a female business owner, I believe such a mandate will bring a positive effect to businesses. Before founding Kobe, a social media technology agency, I was a business director and the only female board member of a multinational digital marketing agency. Even though I was not bothered by it, I have encountered challenges as a female leader in an organisation.
Tone at the top, tune in the middle and beat at the bottom. Driving diversity at board level will set the tone at the top for internal hiring practices that is applicable even for junior roles. We must not forget that a diverse and inclusive professional environment considers gender, tenure, age, experience and race fairly.

THE push for diversity on corporate boards is to be applauded and encouraged, and should be regarded by corporate management as a business imperative in the 21st century. In common with an increasing number of global businesses, we aim to integrate diversity and inclusion - whether it be gender, race, ethnicity, religion or lifestyle - into all areas of our business, including senior leadership roles. The fresh perspectives, different experiences and divergent thinking help to develop a broader pool of available talent from which we choose the best people for any appointment on merit. This, in turn, makes for better leadership and stronger businesses. Yet, it is not as easy to achieve as it may sound, and one might argue that it requires a longer term commitment to a broader organisational cultural change.
Yap Boh Tiong

HAVING more diversity on the board is very important but why focus on adding more women only?
Shouldn't all companies consider other talents to ensure that the board can function more effectively?
Currently, most boards are overly represented by lawyers and accountants. What about other professions?
With corporate scandals becoming common, what about including an internal auditor who can confront complex oversight accountability or a communications expert who can identify potential issues and also advise on the management of crises?
Perhaps even a data scientist, so crucial today in understanding and analysing big data which can affect an organisation's bottom line.
A knowledgeable board, represented by diverse talents regardless of gender, is better equipped to understand and engage in all aspects of an organisation's operations and thus contribute effectively.
Toby Koh
Group Managing Director
Ademco Security Group
FORCED gender diversity on corporate boards would simply put the movement a step forward and three steps back. None of the women I have spoken to on this matter feel that a mandated motion is necessary. In fact, they objected and felt slighted at this suggestion.
Boards are not a Men's Club. Boards will bring the women on board when doing so adds best value and best fit. Singapore in general is not a sexist society and certainly does not seem to be headed that way. Natural evolution is best.
Cindy Leong
Founder & Corporate Trainer
Relationship Studio
AS much as this is a useful mandate, what is more important is whether that candidate is the best fit for the role. One way to do that is to remove stereotypes associated with both genders.
For example, women are often seen as being more emotional and less ambitious and hence not as capable as men. However, as a personality coach to business owners and individuals, I see that everyone brings a unique skill set and gifting that often transcends gender.
Therefore, rather than focus on gender, it is more crucial to understand how one's capabilities can blend with those of other members of the team. With now more women in the workforce than before, I am confident this will consequently lead to an increase of females in key leadership positions.

WHILE it would be great to see companies include more women in leadership roles voluntarily and on merit, perhaps mandating gender diversity on corporate boards might act as a catalyst in changing attitudes and achieving this.
Over the past decade, several countries in Europe including Norway, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands introduced quotas for female directors on corporate boards, and the results seem encouraging, with reports of even private companies not impacted by the quotas nominating more women to their boards. Singapore could look at what these countries have done to develop a model that would work here.
That said, CWT is not a listed company and we don't have quotas for women in leadership roles. We hire and promote people based on merit, and we track the number of women in our organisation when conducting our annual talent review, as part of our conscious efforts to have strong female representation in our leadership. Today, women comprise close to 40 per cent of our Asia-Pacific leadership team, and more than 40 per cent of our senior leaders globally are women.
Christophe Duchatellier
CEO, Asia-Pacific
The Adecco Group
WE believe that boardroom diversity can provide competitive advantages such as better decision-making, helping attract top talent and improving customer orientation. Singapore companies have made some progress in this aspect although the pace has been slow.
Mandating a fixed diversity target is one way of boosting the pace but it can also lead to unwanted outcomes such as appointments made simply to comply with regulations or some companies going private to avoid the rule - which is exactly what happened after quotas were introduced in Norway. Instead, Singapore could take a balanced approach of mandating targets but allowing companies the flexibility of choosing which target to adopt. In the end, whether it is through targets, quotas or disclosure obligations, companies, regulators and the government need to work together to achieve optimal boardroom gender diversity.
Zaheer K Merchant

THE argument towards greater gender diversity is not one that is purely ideologically driven. It is backed by significant research by reputable bodies. The wisdom suggests that gender diversity leads to better average performance because of a diverse range of information, context, experience and processing power than from a homogeneous makeup. Empirical and indeed biological evidence also points to women being more prudent and responsible in decision making.
In this regard, when more women assume senior positions in a company, the risk or likelihood of a company going bankrupt declines considerably. While these observations might lead one to conclude that gender diversity on corporate boards ought to be mandated, it remains axiomatic that a company wants the best possible talent - male or female.
Ronald Lee
Managing Director
PrimeStaff
ENCOURAGE yes, mandate no. I am entirely in favour of gender diversity on corporate boards, as there is a growing body of research demonstrating the benefits of gender-diverse boards including sensitivity to consumer trends, stronger governance, and improved company performance. In general, diversity on corporate boards is known to lead to better decision-making and therefore help improve a company's bottom line.
However, I believe that mandating a quota for the number of female board members is not the way to go - reason being that it could have a reverse effect, as it could send the message that the woman may not have earned the position on her own merit, but was placed in the position to fulfil a quota. This may inadvertently cause her to lose the respect of her peers, even though she may well have stellar credentials, skills and experience that qualify her for the role.
Jessie Xia

ThoughtWorks
GENDER diversity is a business imperative that must be considered for its economic value. Research has shown that gender diversity improves the performance of business teams, often leading to stronger and more creative solutions to problems. Increasing female representation on boards will enable more robust decision-making and governance, which will ultimately benefit the business. We believe that companies should have diversity goals, but to achieve this, organisations need to invest in building the leadership skills of their women. In time, such investment will lead to more diverse management teams and board profiles based on merit. This is especially crucial for the technology sector, where women are still a minority - from corporate board positions to technical roles.
At ThoughtWorks, we recognise and support this impetus, and have a balanced representation of top female executives. We believe that having successful female role models in top leadership positions will inspire more women to join and lead the technology industry.

HAVING women board members would be a plus as there would be a larger spectrum of perspectives leading to a holistic approach that may lead to better results. However, the fundamental criteria of selecting board directors are hardly about gender rights or even things such as racial diversity, but rather about ensuring that the best decisions are made in the boardroom for all stakeholders. Diversity should not be based just on being a man or woman; it is also about diversity in knowledge, background, training, expertise and experience.
It is therefore imperative to ensure that a board encompasses a good mix of professionals with such multifarious backgrounds. Like in other areas nationally, meritocracy rises above many other aspects where talent engagement is concerned, and the boardroom should be no exception.
David Leong
Managing Director
PeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd
BOARD diversity should not be contrived by means of legislation or mandate. Whether it should be 20 per cent, 30 per cent or even 50 per cent, it is still a arbitrary number. Gender specificity on boards may become unnatural if it is ruled with a mandate rather than on merit.
Boards should not be seen either as matriarchal or patriarchal, male dominated or female dominated but be filled by members who can add value to the board with a diversity of views that is beneficial to shareholders' interests.
Board composition should be governed by who best serves the broad shareholders and represents minority interests, and that role should not be gender-specific.
Female participation on corporate boards and even in government is increasing today. Let the growth of those numbers be natural, where the best person rises to the occasion, whether man or woman.
Henry Tan

BOARD diversity to me is a diversity of members from different backgrounds, cultural and industry-wise, and this could include gender diversity. So I think to narrow board diversity to just gender diversity and pushing for 20 per cent board representation is a wrong move. To ensure ""comply or explain"" is another very typical Singaporean move. I believe that many women directors also do not agree with this move as it signals that there is a need to help the female gender, which is not at all true. I have met many capable female board members and senior executives, and they did not get to where they are through any gender diversity push. As an example, six of our firm's 18 partners, or one-third, are female. We did not mandate anything; our female leaders were admitted to partnership based on their own capabilities.
I believe that Singapore boards are mature enough to decide on their own who will best serve their boards without any need for any gender diversity mandate.
Lee Siang
Chief Executive Officer
Dyslexia Association of Singapore
THE composition of the senior leadership of any organisation is often a reflection of the composition of the workforce of that industry. At the Dyslexia Association of Singapore which is largely an educational institution, six out of eight members or 75 per cent of our senior management are females. This reflects the high percentage of women in the education industry.
As such, beyond the discussion of quotas on boards and leadership, there must also be emphasis on the development of personnel in the organisation and the industry. As more women join the industry and the organisation and rise through the ranks, more will be in a position to assume board and management roles.
Nirvik Singh
Chairman & CEO
Grey Group, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa
THE failure to include highly qualified women is not only a waste of talent but additionally, a loss of economic growth potential.
A European Commission report (2015) noted that only 21.2 per cent of board members of the largest listed companies in the EU were women; in 2010, this number was 11.9 per cent.
Interestingly, the progress was attributed to a combination of political and regulatory pressure. Initially, self-regulation by companies was adopted but it soon became apparent this was not visible at the expected pace. Legislative initiatives to accelerate this issue were then implemented. There is a long way to go still but by putting policies in place, companies have a clear benchmark on the statistics they need to achieve.
At Grey Group, we are an Equal Opportunities Employer. Currently in APAC, seven of the 14 CEOs are women. In addition, one of our three global businesses run out of Asia is led by a woman. Companies that have embraced gender equality as part of their culture will find that their boards are already gender-diverse. There is definitely scope for improvement and positive action to further narrow the gap is necessary.
Referring to the Global Gender Gap Report that covered 144 countries in 2016, the World Economic Forum said : ""More than a decade of data has revealed that progress is still too slow for realising the full potential of one half of humanity within our lifetime.""
Terence Yuen

BP
BP was the first energy company to clearly state gender aspiration targets in 2012, for women to represent at least 25 per cent of group leaders, our most senior managers, and 30 per cent at senior manager level - by 2020. Our corporate nomination committee actively takes diversity into account when seeking potential candidates for the board.
These aspirational targets have been successful in keeping our organisation focused on female talent attraction and development. Employees have also established groups around a range of interests, including gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability. These groups support the business for greater employee inclusion and engagement particularly in recruitment, retention, development and motivation of our staff.

MORE can be done to achieve greater gender diversity not just on corporate boards but in all leadership positions. Business leaders should be committed to change, and setting targets and being accountable to meeting those targets are key in driving behavioural change.
Telstra recently announced a new policy that requires at least 50 per cent of candidates on recruitment shortlists to be women. Initiatives like the Telstra Business Woman in Asia Award also provide a forum where female business leaders can support one another and celebrate achievements. There is no silver bullet to achieving greater gender equality in our workforce but the cumulative effect of various initiatives can make a difference.
Max Loh

SETTING mandated targets may hasten the pace of change as what does not get measured does not get done. However, a deep-seated desire to achieve gender diversity for its business linkage merits would be more purposeful and enduring. Tokenism or ""box-ticking"" for compliance will only hurt the spirit of corporate governance. We can however, more proactively adopt a ""comply or explain"" approach on board composition, where companies are encouraged to set their own diversity targets, disclose these publicly and share their plans to achieve them.
A 20 per cent target can be referenced as a starting point. More importantly, achieving gender diversity is not just about the number of seats but also the quality of those seats and the ability to leverage different perspectives to drive innovation and enterprise.
The overall spirit of creating equal merit-based opportunities, enablement and access to board positions for both genders as a business imperative should prevail.
Gopi Mirchandani

COMPANIES and their boards can only truly thrive when they are representative of the workforce as a whole and that includes having women in management positions within the organisation.
Pledging to double the number of women on the board of listed companies to 20% in Singapore by 2020 is a step in the right direction and I believe mandating it can only help further this ambition.
At NN IP, gender diversity is a key part of our strategic agenda. We recognise that companies benefit when there is diversity in the boardroom and it is proven that women apply better to leadership qualities such as role modelling, people development, expectations and rewards. It is important to build a cadre of women who can contribute at a strategic level in any organisation.
Therefore, we believe this initiative to increase the number of women on the boards of listed companies is a step in the right direction. As a reflection of our belief in gender diversity, one third of NN IP employees are female and within our Asia Management Committee, 54 per cent are women.
Darren Rushworth

GLOBALLY, SAP made a commitment to have 25 per cent women in management by the end of 2017, but our approach to gender equality is a holistic one. Quotas alone often divert attention from the multiple measures needed to fix the real problem, which is the challenge of retaining women and promoting them to influential line positions. The necessary measures include policies to help balance work and family life, mentoring programmes and specialised training. What we also need is a society that provides support - quality childcare services, family leave policies, supportive colleagues and employers - only then can more women truly become leaders.
Helen Ng

STUDIES have shown a positive correlation between gender diversity and productivity, yet Singapore-listed companies are still paying lip service to diversity.
This reflects a broader problem of gender inequality in our society, from the stereotyping of gender roles in schools to the under-representation of women in STEM fields. We should publish a league table of boardroom diversity in Singapore, and recognise the efforts of companies committed to appointing more female board members. Those who lag behind would have to justify their all-male or predominantly-male boards and their reluctance to appoint female board members with the skills, experience and expertise.
Bill Taylor-Mountford

GENERALLY, there are ongoing efforts to promote gender equality and women leadership in companies, although more needs to be done. Mandating organisations to have gender diversity on corporate boards would only be scratching the surface and not addressing the deeper issue.
Instead, organisations should assess candidates based on the value they bring, their skills, experience and appoint accordingly those who are qualified, regardless of gender. This is the fair workplace culture we should be encouraging and building, not only in organisations but across all levels of our society.

BIODIVERSITY is an essential component of nature, ensuring the survival of the human species and life on earth. Board diversity, although not as dramatic as wide-angled shots of endangered animals, is just as important to stakeholders. Should we or can we make diversity mandatory?

Stephen Wang

Talent Plus
WHILE talent and leadership are gender-neutral skills, the far-reaching benefits of female leadership are hard to gloss over. Research has shown that female leaders are known to excel at taking initiatives, collaboration, integrity, and performance - essential traits of any good leader.
As Singapore maintains its position as an international business hub, the push for more female representation at board level is a welcome and empowering move. Pegging it to a target of 20 per cent is a good short-term strategy that will hopefully spark more awareness around the importance of inspiring leadership in the long term.
Jayaprakash Jagateesan
Chief Executive Officer
RHT Holdings Pte Ltd
WITHOUT a more proactive and concerted effort, the lack of gender diversity on corporate boards is unlikely to improve. While a mandatory quota on female board representation may be a quick fix, it could also send the wrong message - female directors should be selected based on their qualifications and experience.
There are better solutions to quotas, such as ensuring a fair reward system to attract more women to step up, and also nurturing and increasing the ranks of women in management, executive, and professional roles - women who will go on to form the talent pool for corporations to consider for board positions. There is enough research to show how companies with greater gender diversity perform well financially.
Singapore prides itself as a meritocratic nation. Rather than a narrow focus on gender, corporate boards should instead be seeking diversity on broader terms. Gender diversity is important, but let's not forget diversity of race, age and more importantly, experience, skill sets and knowledge.
Rosalynn Tay
CEO
Dentsu Aegis Network Singapore and Dentsu Singapore
TARGETS are a stepping stone but it is more crucial that we are aware of the benefits of gender diversity as well as understand its necessity.
That is what should be made mandatory throughout the company. At Dentsu Aegis Network, diversity sits at the heart of our agenda, as evident through our Female Foundry Accelerator Programme and multiple award wins for women leadership recognition.
Gender diversity is a key driver in outpacing competition and this has been proven at our network where we grew two times compared to our competitors, with three times the industry average of senior female executives at the helm.

"," MERITOCRACY and diversity flourish in Maybank. It's a culture that serves the group well - and something that group president and CEO, Abdul Farid Alias, can personally vouch for.
The banker says he grew up poor; his late father was a ""beat cop"", while his late mother was a housewife.
Mr Farid went to a MARA boarding school in Malaysia for poor families and won a scholarship there that sent him to the United States for his university education. The MARA Junior Science College is a group of boarding schools created by the People's Trust Council, a Malaysian government agency. The institution provides learning facilities for bright students in local schools throughout Malaysia.
Mr Farid's father wanted him to be a lawyer but he was influenced by his older brother who studied accounting and became an accountant. He started his career at Maybank in 1992.
""There is upward mobility in Maybank,"" says Mr Farid. ""My predecessor (Abdul Wahid Omar) was the same, he came from a poor background.""
Mr Wahid, after concluding a three-year term as a government minister, became an Uber driver last June for three days because he wanted to understand the new business. Mr Wahid is now chairman of Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Permodalan Nasional Bhd.
Mr Farid says organisations like Maybank give working people hope that meritocracy works. This month, Mohaiyani Shamsudin became the chairman of Maybank. Including Ms Mohaiyani, the 12-member Maybank board has three woman directors. The three Singapore banks have a combined total of four woman directors.
Says Mr Farid: ""In her words, if I can quote, she is the 'chairman' where the word means a position of responsibility with no limitation on adjectives like gender, or any other descriptions, and that she is the most qualified person to helm it and she has agreed to assume it.""
In March, Maybank announced - on International Women's Day - that it will offer extended maternity leave of up to 365 days for eligible female employees, a likely first in the industry. Some Singapore companies have increased maternity leave beyond the mandatory four months to six months. Critically, the extended maternity leave will not constitute a break in an employee's employment, and will also see the staffer being provided with medical and insurance coverage.
The men have not been forgotten - Maybank also rolled out a sabbatical leave policy for all staff. Eligible employees may take a career break ""for a minimum duration of three months to a maximum of 24 months, with the guarantee and comfort of returning to work"".
In an interview with Malaysia's The Star, Mr Farid said he noticed that a lot of Maybank employees were getting sick. Many people fall ill when they retire and spend their retirement money addressing health issues, he said.
Apart from physical health, people get emotionally tired, said Mr Farid, adding that the sabbatical leave - which is unpaid - gives employees the opportunity to find themselves or do whatever they want. Some may not come back and some come back recharged, he said.
Ms Mohaiyani's appointment as Maybank chairman led to several news articles looking at women in banking - not just in Malaysia but across the region.
Everyone recognises the importance of diversity - ""not just gender diversity and parity - but also in terms of ethnicity, skills and educational discipline, work experience and so on"", Mr Farid tells BT.
""Diversity gives us the richness of skills mix that will be absent otherwise. Without it, the decisions we make will be short of what could have been.""

SINGAPORE may be small but with new technology, it can shape a future that transcends its physical size and enlarges its identity, former head of the Civil Service, Peter Ho, said on Thursday.
Citing three countries that have re-invented themselves in the digital age, he urged Singaporeans to balance their prevailing attitude that Singapore is a price-taker with a more hopeful view.
He made the call in his last lecture at the Institute of Policy Studies' SR Nathan Fellow for the Study of Singapore, a series of lectures that explores Singapore's future.
For instance, Estonia, with 1.3 million people, introduced e-residency.
It now has 18,000 such residents who are not citizens of Estonia. But they can set up companies based in the Baltic nation.
This scheme helps Estonia generate business for its companies, from independent contractors to small companies with clients worldwide.
Denmark, with 5.7 million people, is mulling over the creation of a ""Silicon Valley Ambassador"" to better engage digital companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook.
""This is almost as if technology was its own country, unlike the present,"" said Mr Ho. ""For Singapore, such an approach would build on our earlier efforts to partner other cities and sub-national regions to plug them into international production networks.""
The third country is Luxembourg, with fewer than 600,000 people.
It is, however, creating a market by letting companies own resources obtained from space. These are ideas Singapore can consider, Mr Ho told officials and students at the National University of Singapore.
The country does not have to be at the mercy of forces which it thinks are beyond its control. ""Because we are a small country, we often speak as if the future were a car speeding towards us - we can swerve, or we can run backwards. We can scarcely control the car."" But ""even small city-states can influence, shape, and even create, not just markets, but also their operating environment"", he added.
Mr Ho gave two reasons for his optimism.
First, Singapore can experiment with policies and roll them out more easily because it is small.
It can also correct its course quickly if a policy was wrong or misguided.
Second, Singapore has experience in responding to complexity and uncertainty and can draw on it.
As a newly-independent nation, it eschewed import substitution, courted multi-national corporations and chose multi-cultural meritocracy when its neighbours were going for the opposite.
But Singapore has to have the courage to seize this hope and re-invent itself, added Mr Ho, who is now a senior adviser at a think-tank, the Centre for Strategic Futures. ""Just as Sir Stamford Raffles made Singapore a free port in 1819, welcoming traders from any country, Singapore in 2017 could welcome data from any country - a free data port,"" he said.
It could allow data centres in Singapore to hold data governed by the laws of another country, as if they were stored in the source country.
This would anchor the data here, allowing local-based companies to harness insights from data, he added.
It makes sense in a world where data and digital technology frequently and easily cross international borders.
Estonia's e-residency ""hints at how nations could redefine their identities, and what it means to be a nation, in a digital era"", said Mr Ho.
Such re-invention can ensure a country's way of life survives beyond its physical borders, he added.
Quoting an Estonian official, he said: ""Land is so yesterday. It doesn't matter where you physically live or operate. That is how the game will change."" But becoming a ""virtual nation"" carries risks.
To withstand cyberattacks, Estonia is experimenting with ""digital embassies"", where data is stored on servers in its embassies abroad.
It is also developing ways to migrate data to commercial servers, such as those hosted by Microsoft, as back-up in the event that cyberattacks take place.
Re-invention in the digital age is a matter of long-term survival for global hubs such as Singapore, said Mr Ho.
This is because changes in technology, trade routes and geopolitics can gradually diminish a country's position as a global hub. THE STRAITS TIMES

"," THE global ransomware scare has ushered in an accidental hero of our times - a 22-year-old from South-west England boasting an impressive mop of hair - who had stemmed the spread of the cyberthreat with about 10 bucks, and 48 sleepless hours.
MalwareTech, as he is known via his Twitter handle, holds no degree. He told the Daily Mail that he became ""very sick"" with school, after he was falsely accused of hacking his school's IT system. He did his O-level exam on information technology, on paper - an exam that he then, for good reason, failed.
The modern-day hero's background made me examine my own formal education.
One little epiphany in life came when I wrote a silly over-analysis on a piece of selected prose for a literature assignment. I did not in fact believe that the writer was describing a protagonist who was drowning in his deep thoughts while tracing the circular shape of the crockery. I was simply desperate to fill two pages with the pretext of intellectualism. My crock scored 16/25, which at that time meant an eventual A for A-levels. That week, I aged a lot.
My disillusionment with the education system began early in life, after a teacher selected a right answer out of multiple choices based on the number of votes an answer got in class. At 12, I too got ""very sick"" of school.
I only realised much later in my teenage years how to game the Singapore education system. There was, at least in my experience, no time to indulge in deep learning if you wanted to get top grades. Rote learning is still the engine of exam strategies. I was obstinate about learning my own way for a long time, and so somewhat ""failed"" the system in the early years.
Still, the study-till-your-nose-bleeds complex in most parts of Asia, has, for me, meant an in-built anxiety about making mistakes. Take, for example, a recent test that I took to secure a proficiency certificate in business Mandarin. I felt raw irritation at my 31-year-old self for making a few mistakes in the test, and then I was irritated about feeling irritated in the first place. It wasn't a bad score, and in the grand scheme of things, it did not matter.
That mild neurosis took me further back to a time when I was 15. Feeling ashamed of a B3 that I had scored - incidentally for my Chinese preliminary exam - I wrote a note to my parents to say I'd do better (which I did), instead of delivering the bad news in person. I still remember the note being sealed in a pink envelope.
Today, having not gone to an elite school but being surrounded by interviewees who have, inevitably, I would be subjected to the guessing game of which school I came from. I don't belong to a web of connections that conveys some convenient and preconceived idea of success based on a girls'-school uniform. I'm not cut from the same cloth.
A broader view of life on this small island is something I mostly relish.
I find just as much creativity from good books, as I do from the dictionary of the Hardwarezone forums (though the lack of civility can get nauseating). I don't have a problem with the use of Singlish or ""bad"" English if the speaker has something to say. Too much money is spent on strategies to use perfectly formed English sentences to say absolutely nothing at all. That may be clever in theory, but it hardly counts as progress.
Still, the persistent question of ""which school were you from"" is also an inevitable judgment of underperformance in Singapore, a ""mistake"". It is a damning form of social awkwardness. And so in the narrow, cookie-cutter system that is Singapore, there is as much tension as there is freedom in not belonging anywhere.
Mr Malware-Tech-with-Big-Hair is a success today because he decided he could be good at something, and pursued it with ragged determination - presumably with a better attitude about ""mistakes"" than mine. He threw himself into his interest, which probably explains why he worked on the WannaCry attack though he was away from the office.
There should be no illusions that having such a singular focus would automatically lead to success. In some ways, it smacks of privilege to think everyone turned out just fine for bombing at the PSLE. Some in Singapore would do so much better in a different system, if they had the money to go elsewhere. And even hard work can run up against chummy networks that blunt the edge of meritocracy; passion doesn't equate competency.
I count myself lucky that my young and stubborn ideals worked out in the end (though, given the disruption in the media industry, saying I got lucky is a bit of a stretch). I chose to be a journalist at 14 - the first option of dolphin trainer seemed far-fetched even for a teenager then - and pursued the needed qualifications.
It's unwise to advocate a wild abandon of formal education, as our accidental hero did. But his triumph may point to a bigger lesson for Singapore, as students must brace themselves for a more uncertain future. To build resilient, thoughtful leaders who can adapt to sudden disruption, our society would do better to foster greater diversity, a genuine hunger for learning, and a deeper generosity towards mistakes. This begins with ensuring that schools do not get in the way of an education.

LEE Hsien Yang, the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and younger brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, is planning to leave Singapore ""for the foreseeable future"", in a move he feels ""compelled"" to make.
He revealed this in a lengthy statement he issued with his sister, former National Neuroscience Institute director Lee Wei Ling, in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. In the statement, the siblings declared they had ""lost confidence"" in PM Lee and do not trust him as a brother or a leader.
Mr Lee Hsien Yang, 60, and his 62-year-old sister Dr Lee claimed they feared the use of the organs of state against the both of them, as well as Mr Lee's wife Suet Fern.
Mr Lee Hsien Yang said in the statement: ""It is with a very heavy heart that I will leave Singapore for the foreseeable future. This is the country that my father, Lee Kuan Yew, loved and built. It has been home for my entire life. Singapore is and remains my country. I have no desire to leave. Hsien Loong is the only reason for my departure.""
Contacted by The Business Times, Mrs Lee, a 59-year-old top corporate lawyer, confirmed the intention to leave Singapore, although she clarified that they were ""not emigrating"".
Mr Lee Hsien Yang, a former chief executive of Singtel and ex-chairman of Fraser & Neave, told BT why he and Dr Lee chose to issue their statement.
""We have had enough. It has gone on long enough and we are where we are at present,"" he said.
""The statement that was released was carefully crafted and backed by facts and documents. There are no false accusations.""
On the timing of the statement, he said: ""There is never a good time, I suppose. At this point in time, we have reached a breaking point.""
His eldest son, Li Shengwu, also weighed in on his parents' plans to move overseas soon.
He wrote in a Facebook post: ""I generally avoid commenting on Singapore politics, but this is an exception. In the last few years, my immediate family has become increasingly worried about the lack of checks on abuse of power. The situation is now such that my parents have made plans to relocate to another country, a painful decision that they have not made lightly.""
A large part of the six-page statement by Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee concerns the long-standing dispute over the Oxley Road home that belonged to the late former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, and whether the bungalow should be demolished or preserved.
""Lee Kuan Yew made clear in public and private that he wished that his home at 38 Oxley Road be demolished upon his passing,"" the siblings said.
They went on to claim that PM Lee has opposed this wish, alleging that he has ""every incentive"" to preserve the house ""to inherit (Lee Kuan Yew's) credibility"".
PM Lee had previously said in Parliament that he intended to fulfil his father's wishes and recused himself from deliberations on any government decision made on the house.
On Wednesday evening, Cabinet secretary Tan Kee Yong confirmed that an internal ministerial committee was set up by Cabinet to consider the options for 38 Oxley Road, and the implications of those options.
These include looking into the historical and heritage significance of the house, as well as to consider Mr Lee Kuan Yew's thinking and wishes in relation to it.
Mr Tan said: ""The Prime Minister has not been involved in Cabinet's discussions concerning this committee. As he had previously stated, he has recused himself from all government decisions concerning the house.""
As part of its work, the committee asked PM Lee, Dr Lee and Mr Lee Hsien Yang whether they wished to say anything about Mr Lee's thinking in respect of the house, beyond what had already been stated in public.
PM Lee's views were sought in his personal capacity, given his position as the late elder statesman's eldest son and his interest as a beneficiary of the estate.
Mr Tan added that the committee has made clear to Dr Lee and Mr Lee Hsien Yang that the government has no intention of doing anything with the house as long as Dr Lee continued to live there.
""The committee will be listing out the different options with regard to the house and the implications. This will help a future government when a decision needs to be taken about the house,"" he said.
Mr Tan also noted that both Dr Lee and Mr Lee Hsien Yang have referred to questions that have been asked about Mr Lee Kuan Yew's last will.
The committee has asked Dr Lee and Mr Lee Hsien Yang some further questions about how the will was prepared, and the role that Mrs Lee Suet Fern and lawyers from her legal firm played in preparing the document.
The committee has also invited Dr Lee and Mr Lee Hsien Yang to put their response in the form of a statutory declaration, as PM Lee has done.
Both Dr Lee, who is on a holiday in Scotland, and Mr Lee Hsien Yang have not yet responded; they said they will be able to do so, if at all, only by the end of this month at the earliest, said Mr Tan.
PM Lee, in a strongly-worded response to his two siblings, denied the allegations against him and said he was ""very disappointed"" that they have chosen to make private family matters public.
""I am deeply saddened by the unfortunate allegations that they have made. (My wife) Ho Ching and I deny these allegations, especially the absurd claim that I have political ambitions for my son,"" said PM Lee.
Both Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee have accused their brother and Ms Ho Ching of ""harbouring political ambitions"" for their son, Li Hongyi.
PM Lee added that while the siblings may have their differences, these should stay within the family.
""Since my father's passing in March 2015, as the eldest son I have tried my best to resolve the issues among us within the family, out of respect for our parents,"" the prime minister said, adding that his siblings' statement has ""hurt"" their father's legacy.
PM Lee, who is on overseas leave for a week until this Saturday, said in his response: ""I will do my utmost to continue to do right by my parents.""
""At the same time, I will continue serving Singaporeans honestly and to the best of my ability. In particular, that means upholding meritocracy, which is a fundamental value of our society,"" he said.
""As my siblings know, I am presently overseas on leave with my family. I will consider this matter further after I return this weekend.""

"," 1. What do you think was the most significant thing that happened this week?
A major political shockwave, arguably the biggest in years, slammed into an unsuspecting Singapore in the wee hours of Wednesday morning.
The two younger siblings of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong published a six-page statement on Facebook alleging that their older brother had misused his power in relation to their late father's house, and had wanted to preserve it for his political gain.
PM Lee, who was on overseas leave, denied the allegations on Wednesday and said he was deeply saddened by the claims.
Singaporeans sat up because Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling are two well-known figures. The extraordinarily personal criticism they publicly levelled on their older brother was unprecedented.
The siblings' grievances centred on how the future of their father's house is being studied by a ministerial committee, against what they argued were the late Lee Kuan Yew's wishes for the house to be demolished.
On Thursday evening, PM Lee released a lengthy summary of what he said were deeply troubling circumstances behind how his father's last will was made.
The demolition clause had been removed from the fifth and sixth versions of the will but was back in the final version.
But Mr Lee's siblings swiftly rebutted some of his claims in Facebook posts late into the night.
2. Did you see it coming?
The last time that Singaporeans got wind that not all was well with the Lees was a year ago.
Dr Lee had been expressing her unhappiness about what she saw as excessive one-year commemorations of her father's death in March 2015. In an e-mail she made public through an April 2016 Facebook post, she accused her brother of wanting to establish a dynasty.
On the same day of her post, PM Lee's wife, Temasek Holdings CEO Ho Ching, posted on Facebook a picture of a monkey making a rude gesture. She later removed the picture with apologies that it was a Twitter-related mistake.
Meanwhile, PM Lee rebutted his sister, saying that meritocracy was a fundamental value of Singapore society - a point he reiterated in his Wednesday post.
3. Why is this a big deal?
Family disputes are often deep-rooted and intractable. Warring parties have complex motives.
What has astounded the nation is how the fight is playing out so openly on social media platforms. Even the third-generation sons on both sides have been drawn into Facebook posts.
The Lees have contributed immensely to Singapore, and the two are often synonymous with each other. The quarrel has tarnished the image of both.
4. Should anyone be worried?
Singapore is bigger than the Lees. Its competitiveness as a financial hub in the region, as a well-governed state with a hardworking citizenry, and as a relative oasis of political stability with the rule of law, is unlikely to be threatened by the family feud.
As a small, open economy, Singapore's fate depends on global trade and financial flows, the collective ambitions of its citizens, as well as the economies of its far larger neighbours.
The Lee spat is an unfortunate distraction from the challenges of terrorism, economic security and an ageing society.
Investors will undoubtedly watch the feud's developments with interest. But unless it escalates in a way that threatens the unity of the People's Action Party or the rule of law in the country, the saga is unlikely to lead them to rethink their positions.
5. What happens now?
The matter might play out for some time before the courts or in the public eye, but what many should hope for is a quick truce, if not an eventual peace treaty.
At the same time, the dispute can never entirely be a private matter, given the issues raised and the people involved.
Singaporeans will be waiting for explanations - and hoping for a resolution. And then they should move on.

"," All parents want to give their children a head start in life, and there is a proliferation of early childhood education centres offering child development programmes. Two centres share how they differentiate themselves from the pack. At Zoo-phonics, language development forms the foundation of all learning while teacher education is the driving force of successful children at Busy Bees Singapore.
WHERE TEACHERS ALSO LEARN
WHEN one considers pre-school education, it is natural to think that children are the ones getting all the attention in their development. Not at Busy Bees Singapore. The childcare services provider, which manages five pre-school brands here, believes that teacher education is the true driving force of successful children.
""At the end of the day, it's all about the teachers,"" says June Rusdon, chief executive officer of Busy Bees Asia. ""They join us, they trust us, and they believe that we can make a difference in the children's lives and also their own professional lives in this field.""
Being a teacher at Busy Bees Singapore is no straightforward task. The five brands under the provider - Small Wonder, Learning Vision, Pat's Schoolhouse, Brighton Montessori and Odyssey The Global Preschool - caters to different market segments: mass market, corporate, premium market and the super premium market.
At super premium brand Odyssey The Global Preschool, teachers must have intimate knowledge of the Reggio Emilia approach which emphasises self-directed and experiential learning through projects. Ms Rusdon explains that due to the research-based nature of learning at the centre, the role of the teacher is to facilitate, rather than instruct. ""It is not teachers who initiate; these are child-initiated activities,"" she says, adding that teachers must also ensure that the skills that need to be learnt by the children at a certain age are not compromised.
Small Wonder, on the other hand, is a mass market brand where teachers have to expertly handle a more demanding student-teacher ratio. The largest Small Wonder centre in Singapore is currently at a Mapletree industrial building at Serangoon North Avenue 5.
Ms Rusdon had been a stock broker for 10 years before deciding to start a family.
Because she began reading intensively about early childhood, the idea of opening a pre-school centre to earn income while caring for her children came naturally. At the time, the government was encouraging more women to go back to work by offering subsidies to working mothers who enrol their children in day care centres. Void decks were being opened up to private day care operators as well, and Ms Rusdon successfully bid for a space in Bukit Batok.
The day after Ms Rusdon and her family distributed fliers around the estate, her mobile phone got jammed with phone calls. ""I had the telecom people knocking on my door to check if anything was wrong because everybody was complaining that they couldn't get through to me!"" she exclaims.
She was very encouraged by the response, and thought that this business would be an easy money-spinner. ""But when I saw the quality of the teachers at the time, I was shocked. I was disturbed. They were lacking in training and professionalism, and they had a very low self-esteem. When you talk to them, they don't look you in the eye . . . So that was when I was determined to train as many teachers as possible.""
Fuelled by her new goal, Ms Rusdon eventually set up a teacher's training college called Learning Capital in 1999, now known as the Asian International College under Busy Bees Asia. In its early days, the college offered full-time diplomas in early childhood education to apprentices, sponsored by the company. It has now branched out to offering more qualifications such as Bachelor of Arts (with Honours) in Early Childhood Education, as well as Master of Education.
Graduates of the college who work with Busy Bees are assigned a mentor while they learn the ropes at the pre-school centres. ""This is the main driver of our growth,"" says Ms Rusdon. Busy Bees Singapore now employs 1,700 staff, of which 1,300 are teachers.
Meritocracy and constant learning feature prominently at Busy Bees Singapore. To ensure that their teachers are fully equipped with the latest skills in childhood education, they attend overseas conferences where they pick up the latest techniques in learning. Teachers conducting the curriculum are encouraged to give feedback to curriculum specialists, culminating in a curriculum evaluation and enhancement every year by the curriculum team.
Twice every year, 10 to 15 top performing teachers are sent on an exchange programme with the UK branches of Busy Bees to observe their approaches in teaching children and performing daily routine care.
New teachers are asked where they would like to see themselves in five years' time, which gives the company a sense of how they might groom them. For instance, a new teacher who says that she wants to embark on the path of becoming a principal will be trained in leadership as well as the necessary skills to meet the demands of parents for that market segment that she or he is in, says Ms Rusdon.
Developing potential and loyalty in employees is crucial in an industry with a high turnover rate. ""I think in the last 28 years, people see us as the training ground,"" says Ms Rusdon. ""We don't compromise in terms of training for the teachers, and we believe that that is the most important investment that we need to do for them. I believe if the teachers can see what we as an organisation has done for them, they will stay.""
And although childcare is a business dominated by women, Ms Rusdon recognises the value of having male teachers around. ""In 1998 or 1999, we hired the first male teacher,"" she says. ""The reason why we did that is because we believe that the children in the centres need a male role model.""
Today, that male teacher who was hired as a speech and drama teacher is still with the company, and the number of male teachers has grown to about 12. While there are some restrictions for males in the childcare business, such as limited roles involving routine care, Ms Rusdon believes that the mindset of childcare as being solely a woman's business will gradually change.
LANGUAGE AT THE FOREFRONT
WHEN it comes to early childhood education, husband and wife duo Renee Chong and Vincent Teoh reckon that they have it all figured out. ""Language development forms the foundation of all learning. (It is) our belief that a student needs to be good at language first in order to discover other subjects of learning,"" says Mr Teoh, executive director of pre-school chain Zoo-Phonics Asia.
Zoo-phonics, which originated in the US during the 1980s, was brought to Singapore in 2004 - the first time that a Zoo-phonics school was set up in Asia. Its mission - to teach children how to read and write effectively though enrichment programmes - sounds deceptively simple, and maybe a little cliched. But to anyone who takes the time to get to know the brand's cast of 26 unique animal characters, it becomes apparent that their approach is anything but straightforward.
""Zoo-phonics is a fun and kinaesthetic, whole-brain approach to learning phonics, reading and writing,"" explains Ms Chong, managing director of Zoo-Phonics. ""The methodology adopts a cast of delightful and memorable animal characters . . . which helps to teach the letter sounds.""
For instance, the letter j is represented by an animal called Jerry Jellyfish. On Zoo-phonics flashcards, Jerry Jellyfish is shaped like the alphabet, and children are taught a corresponding body movement and sound to aid memory retention. ""When teaching different phonics sounds such as the long vowels and diagraphs, there are interesting stories about the animals behind these sounds,"" adds Ms Chong. ""This makes learning to read using Zoo-phonics fun, easy and captivating.""
Despite the programme currently being well-received by parents, Ms Chong and Mr Teoh faced a hurdle in the early days in trying to convince both parents and new teachers that very young children have a tremendous capacity for learning. ""Children are in a language acquisition mode both before and after birth, and language development is crucial to their success,"" says Ms Chong, who was a Ministry of Education (MOE) qualified teacher and author of student assessment books.
But when Zoo-Phonics first arrived in Singapore, the prevailing myth in pre-schools was that simply teaching a child the alphabet will enable the child to read. This resulted in a lack of a structured language learning programme for children. ""We had to educate parents and teachers that language development and learning how to read and write begins effectively with phonics knowledge.""
The couple also saw a business opportunity in childcare centres - commonly regarded by parents at the time as ""convenient drop-off places"" for baby-sitting, with ""nannies that take instruction"". They started another pre-school brand called Safari House in 2011, offering full-day programmes that combine daily routine care with holistic child development in the academics.
At the Safari House pre-schools, which are licensed as childcare centres, a strong emphasis is placed on bilingualism. While the core curriculum there is taught in English, many extra-curricular activities are conducted in Mandarin. This includes creative cookery, arts and craft, as well as outdoor games.
Through language immersion, ""the children learn to converse in Chinese and use the language more meaningfully"", says Mr Teoh, who was previously working in finance. The children read Chinese texts in the afternoon that impart moral values to them, such as di zi gui, based on the teachings of Confucius.
Over the years, both Mr Teoh and Ms Chong sensed the increased appetite of parents for more holistic developments for their children. Responding to this change, the couple decided to inject music into their Safari House pre-schools through a string ensemble programme. They experimented with having their students from Nursery 1 to Kindergarten 2 learn to read musical notes and play the violin. After a successful pilot programme, the move is now implemented in all Safari House pre-schools, beginning this year.
""We believe that musical experience from an early age enhances cognitive and reasoning development,"" says Ms Chong. ""We look forward to all the children from as young as four years performing some repertoire pieces for the student recitals in November.""
Today, there are 12 Safari House Pre-schools offering full-day pre-school programmes, and six Zoo-Phonics Schools which offer enrichment classes. When the couple started the business in 2004, they at first intended to expand through franchising.
But over time, they realised that the franchising model was not ideal if they wanted to keep pre-school education fees affordable for parents. While their focus was on affordability, quality education and the children's well-being, a potential franchisee might not have the same primary focus, says Mr Teoh.
Currently, all the local Zoo-phonics and Safari House schools are company-owned, managed and operated by the corporate head office located at Mapletree building The Strategy, in the International Business Park. Around 200 full-time staff are employed at the schools, overseeing over 3,000 pre-schoolers.
According to Ms Chong, several MOE primary schools have sought their expertise to conduct Zoo-phonics teacher training for their Primary 1 and Primary 2 teachers. Zoo-Phonics also provides consultancy services to primary schools, involving work such as planning the phonics curriculum framework, designing pre-tests and post-tests, and monitoring the progress of the phonics lessons.
The company also has plans to take the brand overseas. Says Mr Teoh: ""Our core offering is about English language development for young children. In Asia, there are many countries where parents are very keen to have their children learn English."" Zoo-Phonics is starting by targeting the Asean countries to ensure its sustainability before going further to the bigger north Asian economies such as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

"," Tommy Koh, Singapore's Ambassador-at-Large, and Thomas Kupfer, Ambassador of Switzerland to Singapore, at a luncheon at Swiss Club, share their views on how both countries have benefited over the years from their growing ties.
Question: As Singapore and Switzerland mark 50 years of diplomatic relations this year, how do you view the state of relations between the two countries both at the political and economic levels?
Tommy Koh: The bilateral relationship is in excellent order. Switzerland has not only been a very important role model for Singapore but also a very important economic partner and we continue to learn many valuable lessons from Switzerland. Over the last 50 years in our own economic progress and evolution, many Swiss companies have been our partners. They have accompanied us on this journey, as we go up the value chain; they've gone up the value chain with us. So in terms of trade, in terms of investment, in terms of transfer of technology and knowhow, Switzerland has been our very important partner.
Thomas Kupfer: For Switzerland, Singapore is a key partner in South- east Asia and in Asia in general. If we look at the trade numbers, for example, Singapore is by far our most important Asean trading partner with over 50 per cent of trade volume and across Asia it's our most important economic partner after the two big ones, China and Japan.
The importance of Singapore is also reflected by the fact that there are over 400 Swiss companies based here. It's an excellent location for doing business specifically in South-east Asia but also Asia in general. Besides that, we have about 5,000 Swiss people working and living here. Overall, our relations politically and particularly in economic and other fields like science and academia are very intense.
All the big Swiss companies, the multinationals like Nestle, the banks, and the logistic companies are here. But also many small and medium-sized companies are present, because Switzerland is a country based also on small and medium-sized companies.
I would say about 30 of the 400 Swiss companies here are multinationals and the rest are either medium or small. We would be happy to see more Singaporean companies locating in Switzerland, if they decide to come to Europe.
Prof Koh: Since we are talking about Swiss companies, one of the areas in which we admire Switzerland's achievement is that, although a small country with eight million people, it has 15 Swiss companies in the Fortune 500 list. This gives us hope that although we are small, one day, we can produce global champions like Switzerland. We need not be limited in our ambition by saying ""well, we are too small"". Some of our leaders think that we are too small. We will never produce a global champion. I say: ""Look at Switzerland"".
Mr Kupfer: Interestingly some of these Swiss companies are quite historical. They are 100 to 150 years old, and still continue to exist successfully and even in this world of mergers and globalisation remain Swiss-based companies with their headquarters in Switzerland. They continue to promote Swiss values and Swiss quality.
Prof Koh: But your talent pool is not exclusively Swiss.
Mr Kupfer: This is a very interesting point, because that differentiates us from big countries like Germany or France. The companies there are mostly run by nationals. Those countries have a bigger human capital reservoir. We have no such big reservoir, so we have to think more global. Therefore, many of our companies are chaired on the board or as CEO by other nationals.
Prof Koh: Your long tradition of welcoming immigrants has paid off for Switzerland. Some of the leading companies were founded by immigrants. So this long tradition of welcoming immigrants, of promoting basically meritocracy paid off for Switzerland. A well-known example would be the person who saved the Swiss watch industry from collapse: Nicolas Hayek, who is an immigrant from Lebanon.
That's why I sometimes get worried when Singaporeans are becoming inward looking, anti-immigrant and I say: no, this is bad, because like Switzerland our long tradition of welcoming people from all over the world to come and live here, do business here, settle down here, has made us strong and has made us progressive. We should never close our doors!
Mr Kupfer: Singapore's first Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, positioned Singapore very successfully as an open place for international companies. The doors were open so that international companies could settle here and do business out of here. That's also one of the reasons why so many Swiss companies are here for a long time.
Question: What have been some of the high points in the growth of Switzerland and Singapore relations over the past 50 years?
Mr Kupfer: The relations have very much diversified over the years. They are much more than just economic and trade relations. We have for example in the academic area very good relations. Some of our top universities are here, like the ETH Zurich, invited by the National Research Foundation to be part of CREATE. St Gallen University, the top European Business University, is present here and I am pleased to mention that the EHL (Ecole Hoteliere de Lausanne), the top hospitality university from Lausanne, is planning to open a campus in Singapore.
Another aspect is that we have had many high-level visits in the last few years. President Tony Tan Keng Yam was in Switzerland on a presidential visit in 2014 and last year our then President Johann Schneider-Ammann was in Singapore on a State Visit.
Prof Koh: I think the broadening of agenda is one point to know, that our cooperation with each other has gone beyond just trade and investment, to so many other areas, for example research, science and technology. Looking at the new, fourth industrial revolution, how to prepare ourselves for this new industrial revolution, hence the emphasis on innovation. We are learning from each other on urbanisation, sustainable development, and so on... Also, the conclusion of Singapore's FTA with EFTA (European Free Trade Association) is something worth noting. It is our oldest FTA with European countries.
Mr Kupfer: This was the first free trade agreement Switzerland, as a very free trade oriented country like Singapore, concluded in Asia in 2003 between EFTA, which brings together Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, and Singapore. Since 2003 it has worked smoothly and has helped a lot to promote trade between the two countries. And it reflects the importance of trade between Switzerland and Singapore. More than 50 per cent of our Asean trade is done with Singapore - with and through it.
Prof Koh: The World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, has become one of the most important platforms as it brings together leaders of the world from government, business, civil society and the arts. Singapore has been a strong supporter of it. Every year, we send a leader to attend the Forum. We also take seriously the St Gallen Symposium, which is run by students.
Mr Kupfer: Indeed, Singapore is a very active partner of the St Gallen Symposium. On the political level, President Tan attended the forum in 2014, then in 2015 Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, in 2016 Minister Chan Chun Sing attended and this year Minister Ong Ye Kung. All of them as keynote speakers. And we have always a good Singapore business delegation. And finally, we have every year, the Leaders of Tomorrow, which is part of this forum, a big delegation from Singapore - students or young professionals. This is a very nice connection between Switzerland and Singapore.
Prof Koh: Another Swiss institution that we work with is the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). It is a unique Swiss institution and it is indispensable to the world, because it is the custodian, but also promoter, of international humanitarian law. And some of us have worked closely with ICRC all over the world. I once served on its international advisory committee.
Question: What would you say are the strengths of the strong bilateral relations between the two countries?
Prof Koh: Our world view is similar. Shared values, mutual respect, mutual admiration and two - I don't want to say ""small countries"" - but two relatively small countries, which have punched above their weight and determined to maintain their independence.
We are both small, for our own survival we need to promote a world order based on rules. So for Singapore and Switzerland the rule of law is one of our core values. But there is some difference between us. One difference is that we belong to a regional organisation, Asean, and Switzerland does not belong to the regional organisation, European Union.
Mr Kupfer: I think that finding good solutions with our big neighbours in respect of the rule of law is essential in our international policy. As small countries, only the rule of law can help us find solutions.
Singapore has chosen from the beginning to be politically international, helped to create regional organisations like Asean and ASEM and being an active member. To protect its security Switzerland, on the other hand, in the old times was more of the opinion that participation in international organisations could question our neutrality and our identity. That's the reason why Switzerland never joined the European Union or the Nato.
But over the years Switzerland has become much more participative and is today a very active member of the United Nations, not only because the European headquarters of the United Nations are in Geneva, but also because we are willing to contribute our share to the international community. Today, we have an active international policy with humanitarian assistance, promoting the humanitarian law, development cooperation, and also for environment and climate protection.
Question: As both Switzerland and Singapore are relatively small countries, what are some of the secrets of a small state's success?
Mr Kupfer: I think the secrets of a smaller state's success are that lines of command are shorter, normally the relation between population and government is closer and there is usually less bureaucracy in smaller states. A small country also has to make bigger efforts to be and to remain innovative, to be modern and develop itself because you cannot just relax. One always has to reinvent and modernise itself.
Prof Koh: Both our countries have tried to turn our liability into an asset by pursuing open economy, recreate by attracting foreign talent, by educating and training our people well, by investing in the future, by looking at future opportunities, scanning the horizon, getting our people to accept change, to embrace technology and to prepare for the next revolution.
Another area in which we turn our potential liability into an asset is our diversity. I think that most people may not know that Switzerland like Singapore has four national languages. You have German-speaking Swiss, French-speaking Swiss, Italian- speaking Swiss and Romantsch-speaking Swiss. And both of us have succeeded in creating a united nation, where people of different races live harmoniously together.
Question: As prominent players in their respective regions - South-east Asia and Europe, how do you see Singapore and Switzerland playing a key role in connecting their regions with each other more effectively going forward?
Mr Kupfer: Switzerland in the centre of Europe is a country which incorporates many European elements like the languages, the people, and we are a part of and a very active and successful partner of the integrated European economy. But we are not a member of the European Union. It was a decision by the people to stay independent and neutral.
So on the political and the security side, Switzerland is not a major player in Europe, but we cooperate intensively and we are doing generally well with our European friends and partners, but we are also worldwide oriented. In Asia we joined ASEM, the Asian European gathering and we also became a member of ASEF (Asian European Foundation). We also have become a Sectorial Dialogue partner of Asean last year. So we are now a partner to all the 10 Asean countries. We have become an active participant in the Shangri-La Dialogue, just held in Singapore with the participation of our Swiss Defence Minister. We try to use these Asian forums to exchange views, to listen and for partnership.
Prof Koh: I think it was on Singapore's agenda to bring Switzerland into our institutions. So we promoted sectorial dialogue partnership between Asean and Switzerland, and we championed Switzerland's membership of the ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting). We see Switzerland as a valued partner, although Switzerland is not part of the EU, it has great influence in Europe.
Mr Kupfer: We should not forget that both our countries are very important financial centres. They play a very crucial role in their regions as a financial hub. We are not competitors, we are rather complementary because Singapore is mainly an Asian financial centre and Switzerland is a European global financial centre.
Prof Koh: I think Switzerland and Singapore are probably two of the most important centres in the world for management of private wealth. We can do this because of our rule of law, transparency and the good reputation of the two countries.
Mr Kupfer: That's the reason why also our Swiss banks like UBS, Credit Suisse and Julius Bar and many others are strongly present in Singapore and also employ quite a number of people. They are major players in the banking industry.
Question: With Singapore focusing on skills development through the SkillsFuture programme and Switzerland having a long tradition in this area, how can Singapore benefit from the Swiss experience?
Prof Koh: This is an area in which Switzerland is our teacher and we are the student. We are trying to incorporate into our new education system aspects of the very successful work and study apprenticeship system in Switzerland and in Germany. So we've been sending a lot of people, both to Switzerland and Germany, to see what we can learn from them and how we can modify this to suit our own circumstances. This is clearly an area in which Singapore can learn from Switzerland.
Mr Kupfer: Switzerland has a very long tradition in dual education and vocational training and I'm happy to say that it helped us a lot to bring young people into work, making them capable to become skilful employees. Today, it is also not limited to just this basic training. Many can now go further and pursue university education later on. So they get in a way the best of both worlds. You learn a profession, you have an identity, you are already professional and then you go for further and more deepened studies.
This system was very fruitful for our industry, particularly for our small and medium-sized enterprises, because they get a really motivated and qualified workforce. I'm now five years in Singapore, and what I have seen in Singapore over the last years regarding the new focus on future skills and lifelong learning has impressed me a lot. We are glad that we can partly also serve as a model. It cannot be a copy-paste model, because each country has its own traditions.
It has been mentioned that there is still a lack of private sector support which is crucial and in Switzerland a historical tradition. It needs a real mind-set change of the parents and the students to realise that skilled jobs are also as qualified as a university job. Singapore is definitely going in a good direction to seek an education that brings the students to the real world. There are many different ways to contribute to society. I'm pleased that many Singaporean ministers and professionals have come to learn about our long experience in Switzerland. It's quite a long process, but in my view a successful development in Singapore.
Question: Looking ahead, what are some of the promising areas that the two countries should now be focusing on, building on the strong bilateral relations?
Prof Koh: In the coming years and decades we will see revolutionary changes in the way we work and in the way we live. I think Switzerland and Singapore can cooperate to better understand the changes that the fourth industrial revolution will bring. Where are the areas in which we will lose jobs? What are the new opportunities for us? And to prepare our young people to take advantage of these new opportunities.
Another challenge is geopolitical. We are seeing very important changes in the external geopolitical landscape. Some of these changes are in geo-economic relations. I think our analysts, our scholars, our think-tanks could help us better understand the changes so that both Switzerland and Singapore can position themselves better to respond to the changes.
Mr Kupfer: I believe we both face the same challenges. Both our countries are quite well positioned today in challenges like digitalisation, fintech, innovation, robotics and so on. We are sometimes handling these topics a little bit in a different way. We have mentioned many of the similarities between our two countries. Those similarities are quite impressive. Obviously, there are also some differences.
We in Switzerland are politically a very much bottom-up country, where many decisions - both political and economic - are taken directly by the population through a referendum. And in Singapore the system is a top-down system where good leadership makes the necessary analysis and then takes the decisions. Good governance in Singapore is high on the agenda and very well done. At the end of the political process, the challenges in both countries are the same and the solutions are often also quite similar.
So, I think we can really learn from each other. We can do it on all the different levels, knowing that we are in different continents but we are both in a particular position in our regions as advanced, as peace-oriented and as well-governed countries, which help us to face the challenges of the times. There is a lot to explore and cooperate in over the next 50 years of our bilateral relations.
""In the coming years and decades we will see revolutionary changes in the way we work and in the way we live. I think Switzerland and Singapore can cooperate to better understand the changes that the fourth industrial revolution will bring. Where are the areas in which we will lose jobs? What are the new opportunities for us? And to prepare our young people to take advantage of these new opportunities.""

"," Singapore
SINGAPORE may have just turned 52, but many homegrown businesses have been around for far longer. Greatearth, Boustead, Drew & Napier, Braddell Brothers, Haw Par, Eu Yan Sang and Yeo Hiap Seng - to name a few - have existed for more than a century.
A chief concern for old companies is succession planning. Whether it is a family business trying to balance lineage with meritocracy or a company working to retain its talent pool, succession considerations is something no company can ignore. This might mean welcoming outsiders into management of family firms or promoting talented personnel to senior management roles.
For instance, Drew & Napier's Davinder Singh last week moved up from CEO to become executive chairman, making way for Cavinder Bull to assume the CEO's position. The firm also appointed Jimmy Yim as its deputy chairman and Sushil Nair as its deputy CEO. At Yeo Hiap Seng, CEO Melvin Teo is neither a member of the founding Yeo family nor part of owner Far East Organization's Ng family. Eu Yan Sang CEO Richard Eu's successor, Aaron Boey, is also not a member of the founding Eu family.
These firms, as well as others The Business Times spoke to - such as Boustead, Greatearth, Haw Par and Braddell Brothers - have said merit is a key consideration for succession. It is an especially poignant issue for family-run businesses which often have to consciously decide the degree to which the firm would continue to remain within the family's ownership and management.
Singapore Management University's Business Families Institute academic director, Annie Koh, said family-run businesses tend to have an advantage over others as the owners of these firms tend to be driven by ""long-term horizons"" and ""a sense of purpose"" behind their businesses, rather than just being motivated by maximising shareholder value.
A prominent example would be Eu Yan Sang, whose CEO Richard Eu - who will step down on Oct 1 to be its non-executive chairman - is the fourth generation of the founding Eu family.
Even though Eu Yan Sang will no longer be headed by a member of the Eu family, Mr Eu said it was important for the family to remain as the firm's owners. This is so that they can provide the ""corporate memory"" and retain the DNA of the company. However, he acknowledged the company needed to transcend family boundaries for it to keep going, and whoever was running the company needed to be capable, whether or not they carried the Eu family name. ""You want to make sure that they can do the job, and it's not just because of their surname.""
He cited the Toyota family in Japan and the Ford family in the United States as models on which to base the future ownership and management structure of Eu Yan Sang, where outsiders would manage the company while the family would continue to own a substantial stake in it.
Although CYC Company Pte Ltd - famous for being the tailor of choice for Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew - is younger than Eu Yan Sang, it has also been run by family since it was founded in 1935. Its owner, managing director Fong Loo Fern, said that she intends to let her niece take over the business in the future.
And for Leung Kai Fook Medical, its managing director, Leong Mun Sum, is the son of the company's founder, Leung Yun Chee. Both these family-run businesses, like Eu Yan Sang, have non-family members working together with family members in running the business.
The line between a family firm and a non-family firm may sometimes be blurry. Although Boustead Singapore was not founded as a family firm, CEO Wong Fong Fui has two children who occupy management positions. Both the children rose through the ranks based on merit, the firm said. Wong Yu Loon is the executive director and deputy group CEO, while Wong Yu Wei is the deputy chairman and senior deputy managing director of Boustead Projects.
Prof Koh said: ""Family firms recognise that they don't have a monopoly of talent if they just source their human capital from the family. So having loyal professionals aligned to the values and vision of the family are critical to the sustainability of the family enterprises. That is why getting the human resources right is so critical.""
Apart from succession planning, these firms have also had to weather events such as financial crises, technological disruption and globalisation. Many old companies have reinvented themselves to stay relevant. The legal sector, for one, has seen its share of difficulties, including competition from foreign firms and the threat of automation.
Braddell Brothers managing partner Edmund Kronenburg said that it was becoming necessary for law firms to specialise in a few select areas, rather than provide very many different types of legal services. Mr Kronenburg said that his firm underwent a re-boot and re-branding exercise in 2009, and is now focusing on corporate and commercial litigation and arbitration, medical negligence, and corporate insolvency.
Drew & Napier's Mr Singh said that the firm focuses on dispute resolution and international arbitration, competition and regulatory practice, restructuring, and data protection as its four areas of growth going forward. As for firms such as Yeo Hiap Seng and Eu Yan Sang, their CEOs said that the key lay in adapting to current trends.
The deputy director of Nanyang Technological University's Institute for Asian Consumer Insight, Lewis Lim, said that for firms to survive, they often have to modernise their products while keeping their authenticity.
Whether it is Yeo's providing ""healthier choice"" options for its sweetened drinks, or Eu Yan Sang making easy-to-swallow pills or ready-made bottled drinks instead of just selling raw herbs, adapting their product is one way these firms have remained relevant over the years.
Firms such as Leung Kai Fook Medical or Haw Par have not changed their flagship products - Axe oil and Tiger balm, respectively - in the same way, but have managed to turn themselves into global brands. Haw Par has also since diversified into healthcare and leisure, and invests in securities and properties.
When asked how local businesses, including family-owned firm, weather crises and remain sustainable, Prof Koh said that these firms display resilience, work to remain relevant and crucially ""needs to be rejuvenated at every generation as if it was the first, creating value with the entrepreneurial zest just like the founding generation"".

"," BRAND Singapore has moved into a new era, with two recent major developments - the launch of the best country brand concept ever, and having a head scarf-wearing Muslim woman as president.
The new brand concept launched in August by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Economic Development Board has many facets beyond its tagline ""Passion made possible"". I believe that it is the most engaging and inclusive way of presenting the country so far.
Initially, social and mainstream media reactions - mainly to the slogan alone - suggested that some Singaporeans did not ""get it"" at first. But what matters more, for now, is how ""Passion made possible"" has resonated much better with outsiders. For example, a set of online video interviews shows that foreigners even find the new brand concept ""perfectly apt"", and can see how it references the opportunities for personal advancement that are available and realisable here.
The concept's best attribute is its authenticity - how, instead of using commercial actors, it profiles real people with genuine dreams, and how their passions are made possible in Singapore's conducive, nurturing environment. These citizen brand ambassadors range from a Michelin-starred chef to a teenage champion indoor skydiver. They reflect the shift in brand focus ""from place to person"" - from what you can do in Singapore, to what you can be.
Tourists and anyone else looking to visit or relocate to Singapore can also identify with the career passion of, say, a nature guide or a traditional opera dancer. To some vicarious extent, these foreigners will know that in the Lion City, they can pursue their own passions of bird-watching or seeking culturally-rich experiences on their travels.
""Passion made possible"" has been launched in 13 of STB's 15 top markets internationally so far. The concept's other attractive aspect is its approach of collaborating with, and thereby also promoting alongside, foreign brand ambassadors. This is something unusual in the branding industry.
For example, the launch in Britain was held with the London Cocktail Week in October, where two British authors launched their book about great cocktail bars around the world, devoting four pages to Singapore's liquid enticements. In Japan, the friendship between a famous Japanese actor and a Singaporean designer was shared in a Youtube video, as part of a Singapore design showcase exhibited in Tokyo.
The other significant shift for Brand Singapore is, in some ways, even more visible. The walkover election in September of President Halimah Yacob drew considerable concern among Singaporeans over its process. But, political controversy aside, having her as head of state is already having, and will continue to have, tremendous impact on how people around the world perceive Singapore.
In addition to gender and religion, observers are taking note of the president's own ethnic minority status and humble socio-economic beginnings. And regional reactions have been overwhelmingly positive, as expressed in this statement by a Malaysian politician, that Singapore's new president is ""an iconic image that emphasises harmony and stability . . . as the world is still struggling with regressive issues regarding women and Islamophobia"".
ROLE MODEL
Clearly, the power of the presidency as symbol and role model for multiculturalism - and, more contentiously, also for meritocracy - was appreciated and intended, as captured in the words of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the swearing-in, that the new president represents ""who we are and what we want to be"".
So, external perceptions of Singapore's embrace of diversity will surely be refreshed and reaffirmed. This will further boost what is the most outstanding aspect of Brand Singapore - its longstanding commitment to openness to the world, at this time of de-globalisation, when places and people are becoming increasingly protectionist with everything from trade and immigration, to values and beliefs. The irony here is that the ""fine city"" of rules and regulations is, in some ways, more welcoming and flexible than many other nations in some areas of the flow of goods and services, people and ideas.
At home in Singapore, among the selfie-hunting crowds that rush forward at all the new president's public appearances will be young Singaporeans who, growing up with an authority figure like her, must surely be positively influenced - at least in some way, and if only sub-consciously - in their own sense of multiculturalism.
This connects with the new brand concept's aim to showcase the brand attributes of the typical Singaporean's earnestness, energy and enterprising spirit. When it comes to branding, coherence is always useful. And here is an unintended aspect of symbolic symmetry: Singapore's new president - once a typical, ordinary woman; now head of state - is herself an emblem of passion made possible.

MORE working people with different types of jobs - from managers to freelancers - can expect to be offered help by the labour movement from now on.
The National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) wants to use more services and groupings to represent ""all working people"", and updated its constitution on Wednesday to formalise this.
While it has already been reaching out to more groups of workers in recent years, the previous constitution could have been narrowly interpreted as covering only the representation of rank and file workers using unions as the only mechanism, said labour chief Chan Chun Sing.
But the more diverse economic landscape now means working people are on a continuum, he said.
""In today's world, in our Singapore system of continuous meritocracy, people move fluidly in between jobs and we shouldn't have this artificial divide as to who is considered rank and file (and) who is considered PMEs (professionals, managers and executives). We also shouldn't have the artificial divide where the union is the only mechanism to organise and represent workers,"" he said.
""Over the last few years, we have started experimenting with different forms of organising and representing our workers. We have gone beyond protection and privileges to placement and progression.""
Mr Chan noted that many unions today also include PMEs, though they receive different services according to the laws regulating collective bargaining.
Beyond nearly 60 unions, NTUC also has more than 60 U Associates - which are professional associations - as well as a unit for freelancers and self-employed workers, a unit for workers in small and medium-sized enterprises and groups helping migrant workers.
The constitutional changes, along with nine papers charting the direction for the NTUC in the year ahead, were supported by about 97 per cent of the 700 delegates who voted at a conference on Wednesday.
Other areas NTUC will be working on include helping PMEs expand their professional networks and gain skills to stay competitive, establishing industry standards and fair practices for freelancers and self-employed people such as insurance schemes, and raising awareness of migrant workers' rights.
It is also bringing unions and U Associates together in 23 clusters corresponding to the industry transformation maps being launched for them to look at how the plans can be implemented to help workers in specific jobs.

ONE could well describe the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) as a sort of sovereign wealth fund (SWF) in reverse.
While many SWFs around the world invest abroad primarily, the raison d'etre of the six-year-old RDIF is to attract foreign capital to invest in Russian projects, with the aim of lowering the risk for foreign funds as they are partnering with the state.
The RDIF has a total of US$40 billion under management - US$10 billion from the Russian government to kick-start the fund in 2011, and the rest from its many joint partnerships that have been committed to date.
RDIF has more than 20 major partnerships, including one with China Investment Corporation to create a US$2 billion Russia-China Investment Fund, of which 70 per cent will be invested in Russia.
There is also a deal with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation to have each entity invest US$500 million for various joint investments.
RDIF's charismatic chief executive officer, the 42-year-old Kirill Dmitriev, is part of the fund's nine-member supervisory board.
The board's other members include Russia's Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, the country's central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina and former International Monetary Fund managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
Mr Dmitriev, a Harvard and Stanford-educated former Goldman Sachs banker who has been with the fund since day one, has been busy jetting around the globe to attract more strategic partners to do business in Russia.
He was in the Vietnamese coastal city of Danang earlier this month to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation's (Apec) business advisory council meetings.
He later spent several days in Singapore for a series of meetings with potential investors and existing partners.
When The Business Times met him at his hotel in Danang after the Apec meetings, Mr Dmitriev spoke of how the focus at RDIF is not just on bringing in the money, but getting the necessary expertise on board that can benefit Russian industries.
He cites the Vladivostok International Airport as a prime example.
Last year, an agreement was signed between Changi Airports International (CAI), Russian investment firm Basic Element and RDIF. Under the deal, CAI and its partners invest, manage and operate the airport.
""Vladivostok is our hub for the Russian Far East, and we want to open the area up to more tourists and business travel,"" said Mr Dmitriev. International traffic to that airport in 2017 grew by 40 per cent year-on-year.
""While we value the funds coming from Changi, what we value even more is Changi's expertise. We want to have these world-class operators and top companies and airlines work with Russia.""
Mr Dmitriev also said RDIF has begun discussions with Singapore's Olam International, and he hopes to finalise an agreement with the agri-trader before too long.
""We are constantly seeking top efficient Singapore companies such as Changi and Olam, that will be able to have a strong partner to help them invest in Russia and take advantage of our growing markets,"" he said.
Mr Dmitriev singled out agriculture, technology and infrastructure as among the sectors where he hopes more foreign investors, including those from Singapore, can consider investing in.
He described the political and business relationship between Russia and Singapore as strong and committed.
At the government level, there is a High-Level Russia-Singapore Inter-Governmental Commission that meets regularly and is co-chaired by Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov and Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.
Many Singapore and Russia companies also participate in a bilateral business forum every year. The most recent event in Moscow in October had a focus on smart cities and urban solutions.
""We appreciate the model that Singapore has built over the years, which is one of meritocracy, efficiency, analytical decision-making, and strong advances in technology,"" said Mr Dmitriev.
""We would like to apply all these things, and more, to the Russian economy. And if we can do this properly, we can make Russian companies more efficient and unleash lots of value for them,"" he added.

SINGAPORE is still far from reaching the Diversity Action Committee's (DAC) target of having a 20 per cent female representation on the boards of listed companies here by 2020, going by data released on Friday.
Figures from the DAC showed that females held a 12.2 per cent share of board seats among the top 100 listed firms in Singapore as at June last year, while the total representation of women on all companies listed in Singapore was 10.3 per cent.
To achieve the 20 per cent goal - set by DAC in 2016 to address the under-representation of women on corporate boards here - an additional 130 female directors will have to be appointed each year from now until 2020, said Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu.
But Ms Fu added that the target is achievable if companies here are committed to make the change.
""What it takes is half of the companies on the Singapore Exchange, especially those without female directors, to each make an effort to appoint just one female director to their board,"" she said.
Speaking at the launch of a study on gender diversity on Singapore's boards on Friday, Ms Fu noted that the republic's female labour force participation rate grew from 57 per cent in 2011 to 60.4 per cent in 2016, with women making up up more than 45 per cent of the labour force today.
""But women only occupy just over 10 per cent of board seats. This is far from optimal,"" she said.
Ms Fu added: ""Having female board members makes sound business sense, as they can bring diversity in views and ideas to the table. They can help manage gender-based opportunities and challenges. They can also add value to your policies and practices, providing perspectives from women, for women in the workplace.
""As the business landscape rapidly evolves, corporates and boardrooms must adapt and be equipped with more diverse strengths, skills and talent. Only then can you be truly progressive, successful and sustainable in the long run.""
The study, conducted by the Human Capital Leadership Institute (HCLI) and BoardAgender, found that based on 41 interviews with stakeholders from representative groups of firms of different industries and market, the majority had warned of the danger of tokenism and the consequences of deviating from a meritocratic nomination process.
""However, unfettered pursuit of meritocracy during nomination and selection process may sometimes preclude the consideration of women as potential candidates,"" it noted.
Don Chen, assistant vice-president of knowledge and solutions at HCLI and lead researcher of the project, said: ""Meritocracy and gender diversity are not mutually exclusive. Boards need to strike a balance between looking for candidates who fit their archetype to a 'T' and the benefits of gender diversity where members bring a greater variety of skills and perspectives to the table.""
The study also highlighted much-needed changes in board processes that will help advance the diversity agenda.
It said that companies should adopt a deliberate and targeted board renewal process. This will counter the issue of having entrenched board directors (board directors who serve beyond the recommended number of years) and having boards that seek replacements rather than renewal (boards seeking new members who share the same profile as outgoing directors instead of recruiting new directors who can augment the skill gaps of the board).
It added that companies should also protect the independence of nominating committees to enhance the selection process, given that they have the power to refocus the board by putting in place directors who have the right skills and talent mix to deal with future business challenges.
