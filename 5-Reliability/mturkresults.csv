"," ""Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!""
The Red Queen in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass
CASUAL sexism is something I believe every female has encountered at some point.
Once, an older business leader told me over lunch that Singaporean women are too picky when it comes to their choice of husbands. I responded that having high standards is a good thing - Singaporean men can then step up to the plate. That did not go down too well. Another in the food and beverage line also told me innocently that female staff need to be ""pampered"" with more TLC (tender loving care) as women are always quarrelling among themselves. I nearly choked on my tea. These are nice, well-meaning men, who don't even have a clue that what they said is offensive. This makes addressing these deep-rooted beliefs and mindsets all the more challenging.
The problem is, men are not the only ones who can be sexist. Some women have internalised such ideas over the years, and to this day still believe that their husband's job takes precedence or that females don't make good leaders. But this does not fully explain the lack of outrage among Singapore women regarding the pay gap and female leadership representation. BT Weekend finds out if working women here are unaware, nonchalant or resigned to fate.
Please mind the gap
One study that particularly hits close to home is by NUS Business School's Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations, which found that female directors earned 56.8 per cent of male directors' remuneration on average, indicating a gender pay gap of 43.2 per cent.
Lead author associate professor Marleen Dieleman told The Business Times that the disparity in board pay is due to two reasons: women getting paid less for the same role, and women being relegated to lower-paying roles. She explains: ""The overall pay gap is large mainly because women are rarely present in the highest paying director roles such as CEO or executive chairman.""
Women who did manage to get on boards are observed to be relegated to lower-paying roles even if they are capable, she points out.
The report findings may not be surprising, but it is Singapore women's rather lukewarm response to it that is worrying. Junie Foo, co-founder and chairwoman of BoardAgender, says that women in Singapore are certainly aware of the disparity, but may not want to take it upon themselves to go through the grief of addressing it. ""More often than not, women don't really ask (to be paid more). When they go to their bosses and say they have done this, this and this, they come across as aggressive. It penalises them and perpetuates the situation.""
Not all managers are so enlightened to appreciate assertive women who stand up for themselves. It is a risk not many are willing to take. Trina Liang-Lin, president of the Singapore Committee for UN Women, adds that women tend to believe they will be paid fairly for their effort at work. This usually results in them accepting what is offered without further negotiations.
""I used to think it an 'Asian' thing, but since knowing about the discrepancy in Hollywood - thanks to the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Streep - I now know it's not ... Still, difficult honest talk in shiny offices needs to happen if one believes one isn't being fairly treated.""
Both of these women practise what they preach. At different points in their career, they have had to go to their bosses to talk about pay inequality.
The problem with meritocracy and privilege
Since the study came out, Prof Dieleman has received responses from both sexes. The men, she says, tell her they can't believe this is happening despite all the research that points otherwise, while the women tell her the number of ways they have been overlooked for pay rises and promotions. However, she has received no reaction from anyone who had admitted to contributing to the gap. ""It's hard to think of yourself as possibly discriminating based on gender. Yet, the evidence is overwhelming that it is happening ... I am concerned that, in Singapore, one of our strengths paradoxically also leads to complacency.""
Prof Dieleman is referring to our system of meritocracy, which supposedly rewards people based on their merit. When she presents data on the limited representation of women on boards, she often hears variations of the response: ""But we are a meritocracy, so there is no problem.""
Yet, findings show that those who perceive their organisations as more meritocratic tend to be more biased as they question their own judgements less, she says. The issue of privilege and its ability to cloud a person's judgement is another factor worth examining. Again, this affects both men AND women. For example, women privileged enough to be in workplaces where they are equally rewarded as their male peers sometimes don't think of the gender pay gap as an issue as hey, it doesn't apply to me. While they are entitled to their opinion, it dismisses the concerns of other women out there who are not so lucky. Adds Prof Dieleman: ""We are all privileged in some way and underprivileged in another, and this study is an important reminder not to allow privilege to cloud our judgements.""
Glacial progress is still progress
Even as women's progress continues to be made at a glacial pace, one key piece of advice for aspiring women who want to climb the corporate ladder and be rewarded fairly for it is to be bold. After all, it is this year's International Women's Day theme, in case you missed it: be bold for change. But this is no blind leap into the dark. It has to be tempered with wisdom to not only know your worth, but your limitations as well. Says Florence Ng, managing director and founder of Straits Talent: ""Women should dream big and not let their ambitions be curbed, nor be afraid to ask for help ... Be brave and be realistic.""
Equal pay and greater female leadership representation will hardly be handed to women on a silver platter - it needs to be fought for. This means pushing back against patriarchal beliefs, complacency, and even our own apathy. A good start is simply to support fellow women in the workplace. Be allies, be mentors, be one another's sounding boards; building one another up will lift us all.
It is an uphill journey and there is a long way to go, but as we continue to keep running, I have hope that the generations after us will face a fairer, more equal society.

","   THE Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ms Low Yen Ling, yesterday defended Singapore's record of women in politics.
Compared with a decade ago, there are more women in Parliament now and Ms Low argued that it is more important to anchor political representation on meritocracy rather than impose gender quotas.
She was responding to Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied GRC), who had cited a recent World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report which shows Singapore's relatively low ranking in terms of political empowerment.
Ms Low pointed out that of the 99 seats in the House, 25 are occupied by women. ""So in terms of percentage, we are doing better compared with a decade ago. Percentage-wise, 25.4, and this compares very favourably with the Inter-Parliamentary Union of 21.4 per cent,"" she said. The union is the international organisation of Parliaments.
Singapore's ranking was 58th out of 136 countries this year, compared with 84th out of 130 in 2009, said Ms Low.
Ms Lim, who is chairman of the opposition Workers' Party, had asked if the Government was satisfied with the scores. She said: ""While we scored fairly well, 47 out of 136 for MPs, in terms of Cabinet, we are really far down.""
Singapore is ranked 125th out of 136 countries - in terms of women in ministerial positions - she noted. ""Instead of having just one lady minister out of 18 currently in the last few decades, do we expect any improvement in this area?"" she asked.
Currently, Ms Grace Fu, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, is the only woman Cabinet politician. But the first woman Cabinet minister is Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, who was promoted in 2009. She was defeated in the 2011 General Election.

","   THE Government is doing both too much and too little, young Singaporeans at a forum told Senior Minister of State for Education and Information, Communications and the Arts Lawrence Wong last night.
The 60 young people aged 19 to 35 were also divided on whether Singapore's meritocratic system should concentrate more on providing equal opportunities or ensuring equal outcomes.
Their views came thick and fast at the forum organised by the four self-help groups and the Young Sikh Association, and supported by the National Youth Council (NYC).
Though it was not an official session under the Our Singapore Conversation umbrella, the participants saw the discussion as their ground-up contribution to the national conversation.
They spoke without reserve to Mr Wong, who will be the minister in charge of youth matters at the new Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth from next month.
One of them was Mr Faris Abdulkadir Basharahil, 25, who spoke for the Government-is-doing-too-much camp. The chief executive of an arts company noted that while the Government had increased funding for the arts this year, it directed all the funding to government agencies.
""Is the Government doing so much that it is actually competing with people on the ground and intermediaries?"" he asked.
On the other hand, public servant Arvinder Kaur, 22, called for more government intervention in areas such as social welfare. ""I'm more of the idea of how an individual can make change together with the Government,"" she said.
On meritocracy, some in the group called it an ""essentially heartless"" or ""utopian"" system in which ""those who start out behind fall even further behind"". But they were countered by others who felt meritocracy had served Singapore well.
Saying he agreed with all the views, Mr Wong responded: ""It's not so much that meritocracy is flawed, but it means having a broader sense of what merit is.""
The Government would continue to ensure the education system would be a social leveller, he said, including improving the pre-school system.
But mindsets would have to change so that Singaporeans embrace different forms of success beyond academic excellence and high pay.
As for how big a role the Government should have, Mr Wong was clear there are areas where too much government involvement could be counter-productive.
Recounting his visit earlier in the day to The Hub, a privately run incubator for social enterprises, he said: ""If NYC were to do that, it would not be so successful. But (it) very wisely decided, this is not something we can do.""
Instead, the youth council played a facilitative rather than direct role, and this was the role the Government should play.
Mr Wong's own priorities as the new Youth Minister, spelt out during his visit to The Hub, would be to support youth organisations and encourage more young people to volunteer.
Young people giving back to society and helping one another would be healthier than the Government trying to do everything, he said.""I do think our young people want to make a difference, and if we can unleash that energy and passion, I think they will be able to make a difference in our society.""

THOSE WHO CAN'T, TEACH
The Necessary Stage
Drama Centre Theatre/ Thursday
An endearing jumble of memories untangles on stage in The Necessary Stage's revival of Those Who Can't, Teach.
There are the memories of an overworked teacher (played by Karen Tan) and her troubled former student (Joshua Lim), recalling his bittersweet time in a fictional neighbourhood school.BOOK IT /THOSE WHO CAN'T, TEACH
WHERE: Drama Centre Theatre, 05-01 National Library Building, 100 Victoria Street
WHEN: Until March 19,8pm (Wednesdays to Fridays),3pm and 8pm (Saturdays),3pm (Sundays)
ADMISSION: $28, $36, $45 from Sistic (call 6348-5555 or go to www.sistic.com.sg)
There are the memories of playwright Haresh Sharma and director Alvin Tan - not just their own teaching experience, but also their 30 years of creating theatre for Singapore.
In this script, hardly changed from its first staging in 1990, is mockery of Singaporean snobbery against plays and people using Singlish. There is commentary on a so-called meritocracy that rewards rote learners over those who think. There is unflinching reflection of a society that relies on, yet despises, dispatch drivers and food-stall owners - never mind that they too can be entrepreneurs.
The cast, including Lian Sutton and Siti Khalijah Zainal, juggle multiple roles. Ghafir Akbar stands out with his portrayals of a hobbling Malay teacher, a boisterous student who tries to get Lim's character back on the straight and narrow, and an enterprising stall-owner who wants to train the school students to use computers and manage a business. This is to the discomfort of Tan's starched class expectations - he is not a teacher, after all.
Class wars, ethnic prejudice: There is a lot happening here and two hours is not enough time to develop it all.
The structure adds to the confusion. Scenes switch between past and present and between the points of view of the teachers and the students, all played by the same five performers.
The revolving set by Wong Chee Wai seems unnecessary and the soundtrack, featuring local music from artists such as Gentle Bones and I Am David Sparkle, is not always in tune with the mood.
But the dialogue is perfectly pitched for the student audience. They laugh and moan and sigh along with the jokes, jeers and lovesickness the teenage characters display on stage.
The young viewers even listen respectfully when the cast switches to adult roles, perhaps coming to grips with the idea that teachers are human beings with their own problems.
If there is a lesson here, it is that young adults need to see more of themselves reflected on stage.
Luckily, this year has a bumper crop of drama about misfits in secondary school, such as Dream Academy's just-concluded Detention Katong and the upcoming restaging of Normal by Checkpoint Theatre. Those Who Can't, Teach fits in perfectly, despite its age.

"," The Straits Times; Singapore
","   As Singapore and the region change, foreign policy will be drawn into domestic political discussions. Singaporeans need to develop common instincts on foreign policy and not be swayed by big powers' attempts to influence views here.
POLITICS in Singapore is becoming more complex.
Basic assumptions and policies are being challenged, not just by opposition parties but also by civil-society groups and ordinary citizens. There is nothing particularly surprising about this. It is a natural consequence of democratic politics and a more educated electorate and we will just have to learn how to deal with it.
Foreign policy, too, will inevitably be drawn into domestic politics. The first signs are clear but not promising. In 2013, for example, an opposition MP who should have known better than to play with fire asked a question about Singapore's Middle East policies that could have stirred up the feelings of our Malay-Muslim ground against the Government. Fortunately, the Foreign Minister could easily demonstrate that the Government had been consistently even-handed in its relations with Israel and Palestine and that the Arab countries understood our position and had no issue with Singapore.
Such irresponsible attempts to use foreign policy for partisan advantage are dangerous. At the very least, they degrade the nimbleness that small states need to navigate an increasingly fluid and unpredictable environment. But they are not the only challenge.
Tussle for influence
IT IS in the nature of international relations that countries will continually try to influence the policies of other countries, openly through diplomacy, but also through other means.
As Singapore's political space becomes more crowded, with civil-society organisations and other advocacy groups as well as opposition parties vying to shape national policies, multiple opportunities will open up for foreign countries to try to cultivate agents of influence. Those targeted will not always be witting.
And try they certainly will.
The United States and China are groping towards a new modus vivendi between themselves and with other countries in East Asia. These adjustments will take decades to work themselves out. Competition for influence will hot up.
The challenge for all countries in East Asia is to preserve the maximum range of options and avoid being forced into invidious choices. Both the US and China say the region is big enough for both of them, implying that they do not seek to make other countries choose. Their behaviour, however, already suggests otherwise.
I doubt they will eschew any instrument in their quest for influence.
As the only country in Southeast Asia with a majority ethnic-Chinese-origin population, and with arguably the most cosmopolitan and Westernised elite, Singapore faces unique vulnerabilities.
Chinese leaders and officials repeatedly refer to Singapore as a ""Chinese country"" and argue that since we ""understand"" China better, we should ""explain"" China's policies to the rest of Asean. Of course, by ""understand"" they really mean ""obey"", and by ""explain"" they mean get other Southeast Asian countries to fall in line.
We politely but firmly point out that Singapore is not a ""Chinese country"".
But China seems incapable of conceiving of an ethnic-Chinese-majority country in any other way. The concept of a pluralistic, multiracial meritocracy is alien to them.
Singapore cannot do China's bidding without losing all credibility with our neighbours and other important partners like the US and Japan. And if we were ever foolish enough to accept China's designation of us as a ""Chinese country"", what would it mean for our social cohesion?
This mode of thought is deeply embedded in China's cultural DNA and will not change. China still has a United Front Work Department under the Communist Party's Central Committee. As China grows and becomes more confident and assertive, this instinct will probably become more pronounced. It would be prudent not to discount the domestic resonance that this could have.
Any attempt to garner influence by one major power will inevitably provoke a counter-reaction from other major powers.
Singapore's brand of democracy already sits uneasily with many in the West and, indeed, with some members of the Singapore elite. In the late 1980s, an American diplomat was expelled for trying, with the support of his State Department superiors, to interfere in our domestic politics by encouraging the formation of a Western-oriented opposition party.
More recently, a European diplomat had to be warned for encouraging some civil-society groups and opposition figures to pursue agendas that he thought were in his country's interests.
Diplomats legitimately meet a variety of groups and individuals - in government, the opposition and in civil society - in order to better understand the countries they are posted to. Our diplomats do so too. But the line between legitimate gathering of information and trying to influence domestic politics is thin. Western diplomacy is infused by a deep belief in the superiority of their values and too often motivated by a secular version of missionary zeal to whip the heathen along the path of righteousness. Some Singaporeans already find it fashionable to ape them; unscrupulous local politicians or ""activists"" may find it convenient to aid and abet them to advance their own agendas.
Neither the Chinese nor the West are going to change their reflexes. We will just have to be alert and firm in dealing with them. An informed public will be less vulnerable to influence by external parties or their local proxies.
Debate informed by realities
BUT most Singaporeans are not very interested in foreign policy, which they regard as remote from their immediate concerns, and do not pay much attention to international developments. When something catches their attention, it is usually only cursorily and superficially.
It is crucial that domestic debate about foreign policy be conducted within the boundaries defined by clear common understandings of our circumstances, chief of which is the inherent irrelevance of small states in the international system and hence the constant imperative of creating relevance for ourselves by pursuing extraordinary excellence.
Countries with long histories instinctively share certain assumptions that bridge partisan divisions. But we are only 50 years old; a mere blink of an eyelid in a country's history.
And even Singaporeans who profess an interest in foreign policy can be breathtakingly naive about international relations and astonishingly ignorant about our own history and the realities confronting a small, multiracial country in South-east Asia.
More than a decade ago, I was infuriated when a journalist - a person whose profession was presumably to inform and educate Singaporeans - told me that there was no ""national interest"". Please note that this was not disagreement over what constituted our national interest in a particular case - it is quite in order to debate this - but over whether there was such a thing at all.
More recently, I was flabbergasted when a Singaporean PhD candidate in political science in a local university asked me why Singapore could not pursue a foreign policy like that of Denmark or Switzerland.
It was quite a struggle to remain calm and reply blandly that it is because Singapore is in South-east Asia, not Europe, and the circumstances of these regions are obviously different.
If a PhD candidate could ask such a silly question, I shudder to think what the average Singaporean understands of our circumstances. It does not help that the political science department in at least one of our universities is staffed mainly by foreigners whose understanding of our region and circumstances is theoretical if not downright ideological.
Knowledge of our history should not be only a matter for specialists. The puerile controversy over the 1963 Operation Coldstore and whether those detained were part of the communist United Front exposed the extent to which the public lacuna of understanding allows pernicious views to gain currency. Historical narratives must, of course, be constantly revised. But critical historical thinking is not just a matter of braying black when the established view is white.
I can understand academics wanting to enhance their reputations by coming up with novel interpretations. But the recent debate over the detentions was more than a mere academic exercise: For some, it was a politically motivated, or at least politically hijacked, attempt to cast doubt on the Government's overall credibility by undermining the Government's narrative on one particular episode in our history.
Young Singaporeans who have known only a prosperous Singapore do not understand how unnatural a place this is; they are sceptical when we speak of our vulnerabilities, regarding it as propaganda or scare tactics designed to keep the Government in power.
In the long run, a successful foreign policy must rest on a stable domestic foundation of common understandings of what is and is not possible for a small country in South-east Asia. This does not yet exist. We have not done a good job of national education. What now passes as national education is ritualised, arousing as much cynicism as understanding. And we are paying the price for de-emphasising history in our national curriculum.
Some steps are now being taken to rectify the situation, including in the civil service which, the foreign service aside, generally has yet to develop sophisticated foreign-policy instincts.
But these steps are still tentative, sometimes executed in a clumsy manner that does more harm than good, and, in any case, will take many years to have an impact on the public's understanding. Social media is a new complication. It conflates and confuses opinion with expertise, and information with entertainment.
Extreme as well as sensible and balanced views can be widely disseminated on social media; indeed, the former probably more widely than the latter because netizens generally find such views more amusing. But foreign policy is no laughing matter.
Or at least it ought not to be, if we are to survive as a sovereign state to celebrate SG100.
